fucking let le skip your shit animations. they are FUCKING HORRIBLE And make no fucking sense.You butchered the people whom fought in this war and made them sound like littel faggots. fuck dice. fuck battlefield devs. They all deserve to burn.
leveling up pistols is pointless no camos no upgrades
i can't event play game. RTX 4070 super can't event play with 60fps. Optimize so bad
could've been better if there is no 500 lvl cheaters suck my nuts EA worst game ever
Going from BF1 to this slop was insane whiplash. Extreme downgrade in every aspect. Nordlys campaign in particular was especially disgusting.
"EA need to get over themselves with their anti cheat crap!! I just want to play the single player version but when i go to load it comes up with ""the latest version of EA anti cheat is required to play! It installed the crappy anti cheat after i wasted my time downloading 90gig worth of data!! If the latest version isn't on the game files then too bad! i shouldn't have to jump through bloody hoops just to play a game that  i've paid good money for!!!! What a joke!!"
got bored fast recommend if you want something temporary to play and waste you'r money
no
not worth the 2euro
The game doesn’t even work on the steam deck. Waste of money. I was really looking forward to playing it.
dying simulator all i can say
not for 2025
"literally unplayable. The back button doesnt work in the main menu forcing me to alt f4, every time i restart the game i have to play through the unskippable intro again, forgets all my settings. I am not playing the intro mission for the third time"
Battlefield 1 is way better then this
unplayable game
BF1 >>>>
Cant even launch this shit. I hate ea games :(
badbad
"With DRX or DLSS, the game is unplayable. Yes, I know it was early days, and they subtly warn you in the settings, but even without it, the game still runs terribly. Transport and camera constantly twitch like they're lagging behind the render. With all complex settings turned off, I’m getting an average of about 100 FPS, but 1% lows drop to 30-40—and, of course, the dips always happen at the worst moments.

I spent some time researching and found tons of articles and discussions about people experiencing inconsistent FPS and performance drops on the PC version. You have to tweak settings, disable DX12, stick to medium quality, and so on—but I’m over it. A mainline AAA title from a major studio with a $200 million budget shouldn't run like this."
APEX is offering another perk—simply click to uninstall and you'll free up 82.75GB of hard drive space for free.
"played it with friend long ago on multi, the game feels bad, kinda funky in a way, didn't really enjoy it"
unable to connect ea server
Retared ass game built shittly give me battlefield 4 back
"Horrendous. I don't want to hear female voicelines squeal in my ear every 30 seconds in various languages. Especially, in a World War 2 setting. Extremely obnoxious autism. Hope the devs are robbed of their ability to interact with computers for the rest of their god forsaken lives on this planet. OR they lose their hands entirely"
The beginning of the almost end for the Battlefield franchise.
Next game is going to have child soldiers if this garbage keeps up.
"Эту игру можно описать одним предложением: ""Отваренный лучшим поваром в мире, максимально красиво уложенный в вашу тарелку, мишленовский кал"".
Игра невероятно красивая. Все эти взрывы, эффекты, в целом пейзажи, но геймплей это просто ужас. Во-первых, вы играете абсолютно одинаковые миссии, просто по факту на разных картах. Что-то типа ""Доберитесь до нужного места, по пути вырезая сотни врагов, привет реализм"", потом ""захватите 3 населённых пункта в одиночку, тоже реалистично очень"", ну и конечно же в конце нужно оборонять этот опорный пункт, пока на вас спустили все самолёты, танки и артиллерию с пехотой в ближайших 500 км.

Отдельно хочу выразить мерзость миссий в Норвегии. При всём уважении к женскому полу, но каким образом 15-ти летняя девочка даёт за щеку целым базам немцев, потом гуляет со своей мамой, которая одета только в футболку в -35, на мосту их берут в окружение с двух сторон и казалось бы, вот и всё, спускайте курок и наших героев нет, но зачем-то немцы начинают с ними болтать, потом мама трагично обнимает и скидывает дочку с СЕРЕДИНЫ моста, дочь как-то выживает от падения где-то с 20-30 метров, потом непонятно почему начинается красивая, но абсолютно тупая часть миссии, где ГГ холодно и ты ходишь по местности и ищешь костёр чтобы согреться (за 3 минуты без огня вы умрёте от переохлаждения, логично!), потом в определённый момент важная книга, которую нам отдала мама, каким-то хером вылетает из нашего инвентаря (вы же тоже документы будете хранить не внутри когда идёт метель, а снаружи, да?), мы подскальзываемся и падаем в ледяное озеро, которое почему-то не замёрзло, как всё остальное вокруг, каким-то образом и так с переохлаждением не теряем сознание и не получаем судороги в воде -30 градусов, а выплываем, доходим ещё 5 минут до домика, где сидит немец, который нас заметил и вот спустит курок, но мы же ГГ, мы с переохлаждением и обморожением конечностей берём бутылку вина и лупашим немца по голове, от чего он падает на колени, а потом мы, 15-ти летняя девочка с переохлаждением, начинаем его душить и побеждаем, после чего сразу падаем без сознания у дверей. И вот бы всё, теперь точно конец, ведь ты умрёшь от переохлаждения во сне, но нет! Чудо света! Наша героиня, хорошенько подремав, просыпается уже утром и собирается в новые начинания.

Гениальный сюжет! Хлопая стоя. А если серьёзно, то ощущение, что сюжет писала феминистка, которая ушла из Диснея, где делала мультики для 5-ти летних детей, где в мире всё хорошо и цветут цветочки. 
Покупайте игру максимум за графику, но вот такие однотипные сюжеты, просто один в Африке, а второй в Норвегии, вам надоедят примерно после прохождения арки 1 персонажа."
please release firestorm as a separate game it seems like such a good idea but no one is gonna buy BF5 just to play it
"It requires a separate launcher.
It's woke.
Its campaign is too short."
"Such a massive step back from BF1, arguably the best Battlefield game they've made. It's actually that much of a step back it really makes you wonder what the hell were they thinking. All they had to do was basically re-skin BF1 and it would've been incredible"
buggy af
lots of bugs
"Poorly polished game, bad in-game mechanics, horrible sound design and childish campaign. Would never recommend after playing such an amazing game as Battlefield 1."
Se ve tan bonito que no veo a nadie

"The game is a joke. Buggy, tanks are too strong, hit reg, and dsync are a joke, im playing cheaters and for some reason there are women running around the battlefields of WW2."
garbage game
ass
lag
trash
fKING hACKERAS LAGGY SHITTY
Need origin to play it.
i down vote every game that has 3rd party account required
this game sucks
I got this game as part of a sale deal with a bunch of other battlefield games a few years ago. I had heard many rumours about how poor the quality of this game was for a battlefield entry. I finally decided to give it a go here recently. I can wholeheartedly tell you that this game is a terrible entry for the series. It is beyond frustrating how the graphics stutters beyond belief. There's no real sense or rhythm to any of the maps. The classes are lackluster. the weapons are boring. This game is a huge disappointment and I didnt have high expectations going in.
"I only played campaign so here's the review for the campaign.
It sucked. The story was great but the gameplay is repetitive. Only the ""The Last Tiger"" campaign that felt different (and the greatest one). Compared to Battlefield 1's campaign, it's just bad."
This game is so UNBALANCED and doesn't make any sense for the time period. No hardcore mode. Dog shit mechanics.
nothing  spec rly...
"Played this game in like 2019 or something.
Was a buggy mess.
Wanted to try it again
Got the following error message:

Fuck EA."
Game sucks
this game sucks dont buy it also peatear just went 1 and 9
Battlefield 1 better
"Poor optimization, constantly getting disconnected from games even though ping is in single digits. Online games are filled with hackers/cheaters and nothing is being done about them (Typical EA), which is a shame since online can be quite enjoyable without hackers."
GOT HACKED :(

TEAM CAN NOT PTFO
"The gameplay feels worse than BF1, is too light and arcady for a war setting. On that, the historicity of this game is atrocious, and made me very angry, as an historian who enjoys games. The game looks a bit prettier than BF1, but it's optimazation is worse, surprising since it's the same engine

5(V)/10"
"Really great software, EA. I just love how changing any of my monitor settings either crashes the game or makes my pc restart. Well done."
GARBAGE
full of cheaters
its aight...
"I am going to not recommend Battlefield V because I look at it from the modern Battlefield perspective, which is characterised by excessive destruction. There, I find Battlefield V to be significantly lacking. Perhaps a bit puritanical from my perspective, but I can't see Battlefield V as a ""true"" Battlefield.

However, if you're looking for a less modern Battlefield and for something more in the vain of late early-mid 00s WWII shooters, then this is actually a decent option."
"big L for battlefield V! why the sigma cant i simply pick the side i want to play? why cant we choose sides when the teams are already balanced? the inability to switch sides of this game is incomprehensible, thats why i uninstalled"
dogs**t maps
"I love not being able to regenerate my health! Random recoil (spread to recoil conversion) is a very good idea for a video game guys! I love being laserbeamed across the entire map from a location that I didn't even know existed! If you caught on the sarcasm, just go play Battlefield 4, 3 through Venice Unleashed, or Bad Company 2 through Rome."
"I hate a game that has so much potential only to let you down. It reminds me of my ex wife, you think you got something good then the nightmare starts."
enfia o tank junto com o avião no 🆒
"Hard to say that is worth to buy. Lots of teams and squads playing in group than sometimes can eliminate the whole lobby and there is nothing you can do about it. If you are going to play alone, I cannot recommend it."
"This game is mediocre as hell. The visuals are good, everything else sucks. The characters are cringe-y with bad voice acting. The maps are uninspiring, even more so when you take into account that this is a WWII game. The gunplay is arcade-y. There is no hardcore mode. This and 2042 feel like Temu Battlefield are soulless rubbish. Save time and money and play BF4 and BF1."
"TERRIBLE game, literally cannot see any players in this game regardless of graphic settings. They just blend in with everything i can hear them great but thats all. Visibility is the worst of any FPS i've played and thats like 15 years of experience. I would rather deal with sbmm in CoD than not be able to see where im being shot from. Game is for rats DO NOT BUY!"
gods most devious punishment toward humanity was allowing this game to be made
takes 10 minutes to boot up
cesspool of humanity
so bad !!!
The game is very unoptimized playing with friends. Keep getting kick out of the game
trash
"Too many cheaters. I've ran into 3-4 games where there was a hacker dominating the whole team, making the game unplayable."
How they missed the mark so much from Battlefield 1? Unplayable.
"a washed down, sweatier version of bf1"
trash game
dogshit
"Fuck you, garbage EA server"
"After absolutely loving playing battlefield 1, I played this at beta and then didn't return until after the season passes had ended because I thought things might improve. It did not.

Vehicles do not make any sound unless right next to you, which adds to them being especially deadly and yet impossible to kill. A directional damage system for vehicles that only half works causes most hits to do about 5 damage to a vehicle with 100 health. Add to that that the dynamite has been massively nerfed, AA options are nonexistent and the ammo pouches which every support player in the game is defaulted to not giving ammo for gadgets all makes for insanely frustrating combat against vehicles. I have tried everything within the arsenal and somehow even on hardcore servers lunge mines seem to be the most viable antitank option which is frankly fucking insane. Suppression does absolutely nothing after being nerfed from the last game. OCE servers are practically dead too.

Overall this is an insultingly bad entry to the series, and following it up with a weak launch for 2042 has put me off ever giving one of these a chance again.
Poor balancing on several fronts, and a lack of features like autobalancing for teams are the icing on the wet turd of a cake that this game is that leads to one sided matches where level 500 players use meta weapons to thoroughly stomp out any interest you might have in the game even on sale."
i hate the snipers
"I really had hope for this because I used to play this all the time when it was released. The game has changed so much since then and I really wanted to relive the good days of Battlefield. It is impossible now.

There are so many hackers/cheaters on every server. It is impossible to play. Between Wall hackers and aimbot, to planes being able to spot you from across the entire map. DICE needs to have all of their games removed from any platform and it needs to be free to play now. They do nothing to fix the hacks and cheats. It is rampant in all battlefields. DO NOT BUY! Waste..."
no working steamdeck new update  before was working
"EA blocks all Proton, Wine, and Steam deck users. Alienating an entire community from playing, can't recommend bad business practices."
Just get Battlefield 1.
"EA fucking sucks ass, and they barely maintain these games anymore, also very historically inaccurate"
sh@@@t game
stick a rod in my balls and shoot a load on my chest cus holy fk this game is annoying
"Battlefield. For the fifth time.

Remember, war never changes.

(Btw BF1 better.)"
worse battlefield 1
"Great game, but packet loss, cheaters everywhere?
Nope!"
"The audio is trash. Selected every setting and saved it, didn't do a damn thing. Removed my headset, played through the speaker and it was the same result. 

Single player is similar to shorts on Youtube.
Multiplayer is like finding a needle in a haystack. Good luck finding a match."
"Logged in after three years of not playing just to see all my progress was wiped, contacting EA support did nothing."
BF1 was better
shit
"Spawn. Die. Spawn. Die.
Spawn. Die. Spawn. Die.
Spawn. Die. Spawn. Die.

Repeat.

2/10."
"the games pretty fun if your a good player, the action and fast paced gameplay is what i like to see. Although as for the campaign they are just trashy and buggy while i cant even play them if i wanted too since i just get nocliped or stuck halfway through, i don't get what the problem is and i'm not looking foward to fixing it"
i have ptsd
"Okay, let's be honest - installing EA Anti-Cheat is acceptable, since other games nowadays have the same (e.g. CS2, Team Fortress 2, but for Valve games, it's built into the game as their devs of Steam). Here the game doesn't recognize it, I managed to launch the game only on the 3rd attempt, because the previous attempts returned an error that the Anti-Cheat program was outdated. The next account check - I didn't receive a security code for 10 minutes, and after a while my mailbox received a spam of 3 emails (I asked for a confirmation code three times). Finally, the gameplay after a quick setup of the controls, weapons for each class - I joined multiplayer sessions with my friends and at first three times in a row after appearing I couldn't move. The matches themselves are not interesting because of the presence of cheaters, regardless of your system, and the only way out is to start or join another game.

Definitely, the game does not deserve to be purchased, I received it as a gift, however I will remove this game from my library in the end."
"The stories are fun and the online gameplay is entertaining. The game is so extremely unstable that I can't recommend it. I have tried all types of changes in settings including fps limitations and lowering the graphics settings. To finish the first story (takes about 1-2 hours if you aren't a very skilled player like me) and it took me about 6 hours total because of how many crashes it had. I tried playing online and it was the same thing. Disappointing experience, especially since I tend to like Battlefield games."
it's a joke
"Women screaming in pain that make your ears bleed. You got bunch of custom characters/custom weapon skins that further ruin the immersion. Gun play is so arcadey its pathetic little to no recoil whatsoever. And the downed feature where you are waiting for a revive is downright the dumbest game feature added to any Battlefield game, takes so long to respawn.

The only pros are incredible graphics and sound design, but everything else is just disappointing. This game will forever go down as a shit stain in the Battlefield franchise and straight up disrespects WW2 in every way possible."
ภาค 1 สนุกกว่า....
"Just cheaters, no way to compete against them"
Game dynamics suck. This game is big pile of steaming turd. Stay away from it.
"There's absolutely no need to write a lengthy review discussing why this game is garbage. It's garbage. The multiplayer is packed with cheaters and the single player campaign is insultingly bad. They put literally no effort into the single player whatsoever. I could take mediocre storytelling or dull settings or what have you, but for fuck's sake the underlying game mechanics don't even work properly. Do not waste money on this even on sale. And yes, it's tempting to buy this at $2.50 because what do you have to lose?

$2.50, and briefly your sanity. That's what you have to lose."
Too many cheaters. Current Anticheat cant deal with autospawn killing (which stops all players from playing) and the last update for anticheat has been YEARS. The game is dead until the new one. Classic EA. I will remove this review for 5.99 if EA is reading this.
i have 6 hours of play time tried to come back and play again and im (banned) because EA is a terrible company thats doesnt know how to make a game playable
EA.
"Gameplay is normal Battlefield fare, actual gunplay is fine, fluid, and plays well. There are some minor quirks such as animation locking that you can't avoid, such as when you get tossed an ammo or medpack, however generally its a smooth experience.

The problem is twofold, the monetization, and the cheating. Monetization is god awful and you're forced to do unfun co-op missions to get a healthy amount of company coin if you wish to avoid spending real money. Cheating is rampant on DICE official servers, people blatantly aimbotting on fresh accounts (or old ones), teleporting, but the major issue currently is also plaguing the community servers - which previously acted as a bastion against cheating and abuse - but are now also facing problems. People can join into ANY server as a spectator and force crash the server, and if the community isn't actively moderating there's nothing that can be done. Unfortunately the community servers for this game have been mostly abandoned with admins/mods just simply not bothering. 

DICE games, especially ones on maintenance mode, end up turning into cheater-ridden or exploitative messes at the end of their life. For $3, it was worth the time, but the frustrations began piling on after servers kept being crashed and nothing is being done."
EA specifically making sure that I get put on the braindead team that gets curbstomped every match
"tankfest the game, honestly crazy how one mechanic just makes this game unplayable garbage. 

Like this make black ops6 look good.

actual trash no real fps skill needed just tank sit on hills and be a lifeless loser 

i actually refunded my 2.50 for this trash, can't even justify that price for how garbage it is"
unplayable with the glitches and hackers
Purchased after watching video... too many hackers! Not recommended!
it works for one or two days and then it keeps on crashing !
The game has lots of wasted potential.
"buns game, dead servers, sweaty cunts who dont get off will shit on you, worse than seige"
"After playing this game during the very beginning of its life on my Xbox back in the day I will say this game was a massive missed opportunity to be a great game. I like the gun play, and the mechanics of it are really good, its fun, however. The balancing, bugs, lame maps, and awful wacky cosmetics ruin it for me. Wish this game leaned more on the historically accurate side, like why make a WW2 game if you make the soldiers not look like their from WW2, and why in the hell would you make maps based on the lesser know battles of WW2?! The amazing sound design of BF1 is gone, this game is so damn quiet. For a war game I expect roaring gunshots and loud explosions with soldiers screaming all around, like in BF1. This game is so quiet. Also they abandoned this game way to soon, and near the end of its life they decide to make better maps that should have been in the game in the first place, and then they released historically accurate cosmetics when the game is done being developed!?!? What thinking is this!? I appreciate trying to make the game be more historically accurate, but its 2 years to late! Like whats the point!? Doesn't help that the game is full of such awful looking soldiers, doesn't matter that they added better looking cosmetics since everyone looks so ugly. Also this game has no team balancing, like your whole team can leave leaving only you on your own and the enemy team would still have like 32 people on it... Great job DICE and EA..."
uneducated
"i bought this game just to play the story mode (single player) yup i was disappointed, there not much to play & the playable thing you no control on the story its like you're watching a history movie, not to mention i cant play offline unless i open the ea app online , so you need internet to play"
"It has terrible stories except the last tiger and is definitely unfinished, the multiplayer games are mediocre at best. Honestly, if you got enough cash just buy BF1 that game is golden compared to this."
not fun
The fucking leafs can block a Kar98 bullet its absolute bullshit
game is good but too much cheater
"Game's multiplayer fully stopped working after getting a new pc, no connection issues and it gives me a ""can't connect to server"". Reinstalled the game, flushed dns, tried everything I could through from what I could find on the internet. Absolute dogshit buy."
"Infested with cheaters that can doxx you, this game makes your information vulnerable. DO NOT BUY"

"I bought this on a sale for 2$ thinking it was going to be similar to BF4 with the story mode. Unfortunately this game does not have a typical campaign, it instead has 4 ""war stories"" which are mini 3 mission campaigns that take about 2 hours to complete. It aims to tell you about important events in World War 2 but you don't really end up learning a whole lot. 

So yes a story mode is non existent.

I really don't know about multiplayer. I tried to get in to a match, I tried every single gamemode out, but it seems like this game is completely dead as I failed to get in to a single online match.

The game is also pretty poorly optimized and requires the EA launcher and anticheat which are just extra bloatware and spyware. 

I would not play this game if it was free. And I would have refunded my 2 petty dollars if I hadn't exceeded the 2 hours of playtime."
This wont open EA is also dogshit dont buy play like some else fps ww2 game
Fcuk You EA
"Absolutely unplayable game infested with hackers, no point playing if Dice or whoever does not ""fix"" this.

I give a 4 for game play, variety of weapons and vehicles, graphics and maps.

Don't waste your time.

4/10"
"easily the second worst battlefield title besides 2042. why the fuck are there women fighting on the frontlines ? did the devs not do their homework? the guns feel terrible, the game flows terribly and immersion is ruined by many inaccuracies. For me , a fan of history, the game just aint it.
Not to mention the blatant cheating thats still going on in multiplayer lobbies. I really want to refund this steaming pile of manure."
"Battlefield 1, but worse in almost every way."
"The gameplay is fun and feels pretty dynamic, but I can't freaking see the enemy. The game has great visibility issues to the point where i just can't enjoy playing it anymore. Plus, the game is abandoned, so they aren't going to fix any problems. Go and buy BF1, if you haven't done so before"
"I like the game, sort of. But it's easily the worst BF game of all time. I know I'm late, but it feels like they heard the complaints that some people had regarding BF1's gameplay approach of simplicity and said ""fuck it, make everything more complicated!"" 

The game is just kind of mechanically bad. I like the movement, but it feels like it traded smoothness for complexity and I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing. Vehicle rape is bad. Anti-vehicle gameplay in-turn is not good. Gun-play is fine but the remaining servers outside of the US have a ping levels that make it unplayable most of the time. Maps are pretty forgettable. Visibility is garbage. The color palate is dark and muddy, and not in an immersive way. Lastly, Attrition was unnecessary and a general misstep in evolving the series past it's kind of antiquated gameplay systems -- nice try I guess?

OH --- and there's cheaters everywhere lol"
Never coming back again. Worst spent money.
"I just bought it to play online, but game unexpectedly crashes after finding a match."
"The game crashed after completing all the tutorials, and it did NOT save anything... it wants to force me to play all that shit again, even though i'm a veteran player (took me 30minutes)

I won't risk doing it all again if it decides to crash again.

I would not recommend you buy this garbage, i will request a refund."
"EA wants us to think their launching system is better than the one from Steam, and it makes their game unplayable."
"Invasive ""anti-cheat"", collecting players information, janky unfun gameplay and the worst, absolutely laziest singleplayer, if you can even call it that. Also tons of obvious cheaters, apparently they are left to be despite the invasive anti-cheat?
Virtually nothing has been improved, yet many things drag behind earlier iterations, say battlefield 4 for example. Map design has been awful for a long time, and decline just won't stop. Not worth any money to get slapped by cheaters and bad game design, plus intrusions in technical aspects"
"tl;dr: it's not fun.
Movement is slow and janky, gunplay is awful - too much aiming sway and horizontal recoil makes it a frustrating experience.
Large maps with very little cover turns every game into a snipefest.
Vehicles are extremely difficult to access, they are almost always taken. Devs should consider implementing them similarily to the most recent Battlefront 2.
My desperate plea to EA is to look at what other devs are doing, and how BF compares in terms of gameplay.
Battlefield is standing with one foot in the grave, because devs mismanaged it for the past decade. EA already killed the Medal of Honor franchise, and unless they start actually caring about the product, the same will happen to Battlefield."
"What a disappointment! I was hoping for the Battlefield 1 experience but with a WW2 setting and what I got was a giant pool of cheaters wearing skins that look like they got pulled out of Rainbow Six Siege.

You (The new player) don't get to fight back on an even playing field because everyone else has unlocked the ""Specializations"" that make guns do more damage, fire faster, ADS faster, etc etc. You have to hit your head against the BF5 brick wall for hours and hours just to unlock a fraction of the stats the level 500 guy has. 

That's to say if you even get into a lobby without blatant cheaters ruining it for everyone. You'll be lucky to just get an aimbotter, 25% of matches my squad was put into had cheaters ""Force respawning"" everyone in the lobby, rendering it completely unplayable.

Oh and you need to give EA full access to your operating system so their anti-cheat can be absolutely useless. Very cool."
slow running slow reloading unaccurate shooting very low health
Game is buggy asf. cant even play it for some reason and EA will always kick you out of ur profile for some reason.
female characters in this game is retarded
"Might as well be world of tanks. As a new player, it is not a fun learning experience to face tanks that just perch themselves at the top of a map and fire below. There's not enough coordination to take these things out- anti tank characters do not have enough ammo to land 3-5 hits to take these out. At least give anti vehicle characters enough anti-tank ammo to feel like they can accomplish something- a coordinated tank squad that's repairing the tank is a horrible experience against random allies that will not work together. Glad game was only $3"
"This game is absolute garbage, this game is flooded with cheaters that makes it unplayable
I wish the employees of EA the worst in the world for this sh!t they have programmed"
"this battlefield V is legit shit. the game is beautiful. but the weapon system is shit, the maps are stunning but shit, way to few players, legit running simulator, or if in a tank or plane, enjoy being farmed. There is nothing fun about it."
"This game is so frustratingly close to being amazing, but it just kinda sucks."
"very bad game in multiplayer... good in singleplayer...very cinematic and choppy laggy cutscene

multiplayer dont worth your time... alot hacker,saw someone glitching around.. shoot through wall...alot gun dont do much damage even headshot... mostly sniper.. im really frustrated why my sniper need to shoot someone 3 bullet to kill even headshot but enemy shoot me just one shot... same with other guns"
anti cheat does not allow me to play kinda bs
"I literally watched the leaderboard as my team had 22 people on it, the enemy had 28. They gave the enemy team another 3 people, making it 22-31. Fuck. You."
one of the worse games i ever played. 4/10. not fun. boring. not even competitive.
1st match in and there is a blatant cheater killing everyone. Good job EA keep making your games like this.
Just a lame game of campers !~
"For this price,it's a piece of shit"
no
easy anti cheat broken now
"Fuck you EA, can't easy install/play. Got error on start up to turn on game from your distribution platform. Fuck you!"
"Gameplay is good but there is no Red Army, too many cheaters, no bots on the battlefield, many women and disabled people with prostheses, which completely nullifies historical authenticity, in general, the game is not about the Second World War, but about the war in the imagination of Americans. Disgusting company, calling to sympathize with the defeat of the fascists."
"Spawn - die - spawn - die - spawn - die - spawn die

I remember playing battlefield 1942 20 years ago and it was fun but this is trash"
I couldn't do the Nazi salute
"Still A buggy mess, Single Player has dispicable stuttering, cast and voice acting are fantastic but the gameplay is the worst since the series began. Battlefield has truly lost its way....."
In the campaigns I randomly out of no where cannot switch or use my weapons and have to last checkpoint to fix it and it is very annoying.
the game is done
This would be a lot more fun if the game didn't randomly stop letting me change weapons when I use equipment like binocs or the skis. only fix is quitting the mission and reloading.
Feels bad to play compared to BF1
"How can I get a refund. This game doesn't load?????
I instaled this game  - it loaded to the menu screen and i went to the firing range... then crashed - I uninstalled it then reinstalled it and it didn't load at all. I want my money back! My computer runs BF1 and Insurgency perfectly - but this won't run at all. 
I have absolutley no idea why Steam clocked me at playing this game for over 103 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!! I saw the firign range for 15 minutes before it crashed!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Very buggy game, Cutscenes dont work for me, overall this game is verry buggy for me and unless this game somehow works for you i wouldent recomend playing"
This game is a corpse. Murdered by the ones who once made a great series called Battlefield. Now it's CoD except not good. I sometimes wish I was mentally disabled so I could enjoy the fruit of idiots labor.
"bunch of type2a losers,dont buy this game."
"This is literally just a far worse version of BF1 in every feasible aspect.

Looks worse, plays worse, performs worse with constant stuttering (RTX 4070 Ti SUPER + Intel i7 9700K, btw), and feels worse. Maps are worse, enemies are bullet sponges, and more...

Overall, just get BF1; it's a far better and more enjoyable experience."
"Spent around 20 hours playing in Open Beta in August 2018. Just realized the game has same bugs with merging HUD and menu screens, not spawning after being killed and revived at the same time, etc. You can play with absolutely unrealistic skins looking like dudes wearing leather jacket from 80s looking like Tom Cruise from Top Gun, women with metal hands, etc. This game was joke of WWII and still is, even after years. Highly recommend to give a chance Squad 44 or Hell Let Loose. Refunded.

4/10"
"The campaign is great, do not misunderstand me, but optimization... My lord, even if on my PC with RTX 2060 this game lags as hell, I don't know what will happen with weaker devices. Good luck completing this laggy excuse of a Battlefield which lazy ###holes from EA didn't optimize properly."
"Game is completely overrun with hackers/cheaters. Every single lobby has at least 1 cheater in it. People are constantly teleporting around, flying above and through the map. Wallhacking, aimbotting, damage cheating, and so much more bs. If I could ask for a refund I would."
"I have 300+ Hrs on console. I would have loved playing this on PC, but your dogshit launcher, seemingly designed by literal monkeys with autism, won't allow me to anymore.

Good game, ruined by shitty launcher.

Battlefield Studios better not have this dogshit."
just bad
FUCKING CHEATER
"Everyone who plays this game in 2025 is a giant fucking virgin, no you may not play the game casually and try to rank up as the game intended, no you may not fly a plane without getting immediately shot down, no you may not try to snipe, you are also not allowed to play as a tank on any map with airplanes."
F\SGA\SZGZSAG
"Green green, whats your problem green?!?"
EA app & cheaters.
I'm really convinced that I spent the original price of money and now it's too cheap to reduce the price to such a low price.
"Slop anti-cheat, not playable on Linux"
Jungle Carbine
like shit
Genuinely just not that good.
"the gun mechanics need work, other then that i just don't like how a shotgun 5 shots in doesn't leave a scratch at 10 feet but at any time a rifle can kill you from anywhere"
"EA has effectively killed this game with their new anticheat, game pins i9 at 100% cpu load on its own now.

Thanks EA."
"Bought it on sale for 2,49€ and wouln't recommend it if you wanted a World War 2 shooter as it feels like a REALLY bad cosplay of WW2

does some things right and some things wrong for a Battlefield game."
the games ass
There isn't one story about American troops in the pacific or atlantic fronts. Every story is weird and uncared about. Terrible story
BF 1 lepszy
[h1]cheaters[/h1]
"Every match you play, you will encounter a hacker. and it will map you Some people keep their names hidden after they kill you. Can't you handle any of this?"
There is no Turkish language support
game is fine but ea launcher is barely functional and prevents me from playing
"actual piece of shit game, fucking ruined, get into match get r**ped by some camper or shoot an enemy 500 times cuz you shoot nerf darts and the enemies shoot actual 50 bmg or some shit and kill you instantly, not to mention if ur new ur just gonna quit because of all the tryhards and the before mentioned nerf darts you shoot, fuck this game honestly, it was better years ago (oh yeah did i mention all the cheaters lmao? yeah this game is swarmed with them!)"
"extremely bad game, very cartoonish.

feels like it was released 3 years before battlefield 1.

also why does germany have 50% women and black people? what the..."
"if you press play then most of the time the game wont start because ea client is dogsh#t and mandatory to run the game, also some maps too small and it plays like call of duty there (if i want small map i play that trash, not this)"
Disconnect everyfuckin single time. THX MF.
Always redeploy! Too many cheaters! Glad that I bought this on sale. Gotta play the Story mode instead.
worst battlefield
"If you're not a fan of Battlefield games, then you might enjoy this one, doesn't play like the other BF's before it, and in essence feels worse off, maybe its just me, but I'm glad i bought it when it was 95% off.

don't pay full price for this"
shit game apparently
"bro ur an EA, do u guys have anti cheat huh?"
THE MATCH MAKING TO BS. you can have all nubes on your team and multiple high\max player on there.
"game sucks, vehicles ruin it, people hoard them, maps are immense and it's such a shitty experience it made me go back to battlefield 1 believe it or not."
"Cheaterfield V, even kernel level anticheat can't handle that"
Game keep crashing on cutscenes
thrash.. play bf1
"Playing on brand new, very high end pc. Game runs poorly, textures look cheap and rushed. Gameplay is boring and uninspired. Even though I got it for like 2 euro. I cannot recommend it.

I loved Battlefield 1, and ironically this feels like a cheap copy of Battlefield 1, even though Battlefield V is made two years after Battlefield 1."
"played this game a lot of hrs on the origin launcher. they update and add kernel level anti-cheat. V E R Y first game that i join has a hacker 120-0, 32k pts with closest next person at 6k pts. 

EA can never stop being awful can they?"
"dont buy this piece of shit, i've play this game for 15 hours and I I've lost my mind cuz how the f there are people who run faster than a fucking airplane, AND THE SLANTED CHINESE MAN WHO HAS AN AIM LIKE HIM HAS NEVER TOUCHED THE GROUND FOR 1 CENTURY. so dont buy this game, buy another games likes hentai game or something similar."
"fun game, lvl 500 recon players singlehandedly ruin it for me, for 2$ it's a good game though i'm probably gonna end up returning to bf1"
"steam deck not supported, i need a refund!"
"although a good graphic and quality game, but as a cod lover finding other cod like games to play, this story is just a mix. Wouldn't recommend."
Gunplay feels trash.
I will firmly say this game is a buggy mess even if you get this discounted. Just don't buy any EA published game. They don't even pay their coders or staff to keep the Battlefield franchise going.
"An unoptimized piece of crap with a shitty EA launcher. It takes 20 minutes and multiple fucking game restarts just to join a friend’s party or invite someone. YOU HAVE A TON OF MONEY, are you really this incompetent that you can't make a properly optimized invite and matchmaking system? A waste of 100GB of my bandwidth. REFUND."
Bought the game and the first match was spawncamped by cheater teleporting himself the entire match
"Even without the 1000s of cheaters this game is too arcadey.

The tanks will wip its gun around 180 in 1.2secs and blow you up when you get near"
"hot garbage. every match there is either a cheater running around or a full squad of E-Sport players with 3 ping mowing down our entire team. I have not won a single match yet. DX12 mode runs like utter shit, stutters like a mess and hasn't been fixed since release."
The EA app sucks it so bad it made my monitor into a light show.
Absolute guttershite is what EA is as a company. Stop supporting these freaks and play something worthwhile. They want us to build their games for them. STOP HELPING BUILD CASH GRABS.
best game forever and piece of shit
"Empty servers because the game is no longer supported. But thats okay, theres always at least 1-2 servers that a full and available to play.

EXCEPT, thats these servers are always hardcore (unless you get lucky), so you take more damage. Meaning a sniper rifle or revolver doesn't require a headshot and instead you can be shot in the toe with a revolver, sniper rifle or the medics jungle carbine and be 1 shot. 

It is just camping simulator with snipers camping in spawn 1 shotting your ass by shooting you in the foot. Tank players that can just sit in spawn (out of bounds) and camp next to a resupply, getting the most insane killstreak free of charge with no worries. I also like that these servers ban shitty auto reloading snipers or huge 1 bullet anti-tank rifles because they are ""TO OP"", but its okay for me to get 1 shot in the foot by a revolver or a medic using a jungle carbine thats camping near spawn."
i got banned in the EA app for no reason
I literally wouldve payed more money to not have every single weapon unlocked immediately. what is the point of playing the game lol
Players are actual garbage
EA added kernel-level anticheat (malware) making the game unplayable to Linux users. It worked fine before they made the change. Adding this kind of malware after the fact should be against the law....
downgraded bf1
There was no refund...
"I know you are going to hate me for saying this but i'd rather play Battlefield 2042 than this POS. The maps are so bland and you barely hear any foot steps in this game, it's like they just spawn out of no where."
"3/10. kinda fun multiplayer, but just way to chaotic and stressful honestly. boring to get killed by airplanes or tanks all the time. and the game modes without vehicles are few and trashy. the single player is the absolute worst."
"The accumulation of all the DEI hiring at DICE throughout the years has resulted in this soulless piece of shit, the worst Battlefield game EVER created. Somehow, it’s even worse than BF1, how the fuck is that even possible?

There are no redeeming qualities here. The maps are utter dogshit, and only about two of them can even be considered playable. The gunplay is a fucking joke, no wonder all the trash casual noobs love it. It’s a laser-beam shitfest, except when RNG decides to fuck you over and makes every shot miss for no fucking reason.

The graphics? A fucking disaster. Not only are they somehow worse than BF1, but the visibility is hands down one of THE WORST I have ever seen in a video game. And as if that wasnt bad enough, the game is a broken mess, riddled with bugs, like the fucking sound barely even working.and the vaulting system being worse than BF3. How the fuck did they manage that?

Every single person involved in making this game should be embarrassed and fucking ashamed of themselves. I am fucking done with this garbage fucking franchise that cant produce ONE playable game in 10 fucking years.

DICE, genuinely, go fuck yourself."
KEEP APEARING CONNECTION TO EA GAMES SERVER TIMED OUT BRUHHH
"The only good thing about the game is the Last Tiger mission thats it. 
You want to play multiplayer ? Well go play world of tanks literally its way better cuz here in this game if u play as anything else other than tanks you will make kills but you will loose the game. Assault with RPG ? If you dont find a ammo depo u have 2 rpg shots barely does something to a tank. You found ammo depo ? Well gj now u will do a lil bit more to the tanks. Broken af tanks broken game ITS far from what from good"
Hackerfest
cant even play it. crashes a few seconds into the game
so many cheaters just pressing a button that kills you where ever you are.. you could be in HQ in a building under the stairs and they would still get you this game is literal fecal matter leaving a dogs orifice... please contemplate playing anything else other than this lazily put together walking simulator... this game lacks everything it would need to be called a battlefield game it was so underwhelming that i had to stand up and walk outside to start vacuuming my lawn because my brain could not make sense of what reality the Devs were in when they decided to green light this whole operation this game has vandalized my pc with its very presence and will never recover i hope none of you waste your time.
Empty servers. Finally found a match and it wasn't very fun. Glad it was only 2$ during sale.
Horrible single-player experience. One man army/stealth every level gets tiring
"bought it because i used to play it 24/7 back in my xbox days, now the game is dead. it was fun while it lasted GG battlefield V"
"Even though campaign is short, it is buggy as hell to the point that you are forced to restart the campaign chapter. Good thing this game copy was grabbed for 2.49 only."
better buy battlefield 1
"Очередной бездарный высер от EA, симулятор прохождения ебаного пролога, тупо нихуя не сейвит, даже блять настройки.
Надеюсь ЕА будет след Убиками и нахуй закроются"
It's was good but ..too much cheater these day!
"The downfall of Battlefield started with this series.

I just wish DICE listens to their community just once."
This game as no anti-cheat!
when i start the game up it gives my monitor a black screen i have to turn off my computer to fix it. and was having trouble with the EA launcher this game should be considered a virus and kicked off of steam.
i hatae this  EA app..suck..still cant login to my acc..i hate app EA app
"the ea stuff sucks, the party system sucks, it sucks"
i fucking love EA
not sex
"EA launcher is horrible, the game doesn't save itself. Every time i launch it, i have to watch first mission intro and setup everything again"
when i launch the app it always crashes. Tried all fix in the internet but none of it works
Boring could fall asleep playing this game
dm game loz lam hack vaicac
Lost all my progress shit game shit company can't even save my account when they give me a random ea account whit nothing on it.
game is about bunch of losers (cheaters) whos running around 50ppl n killing em like its nothing n u cant even report em
"If it weren't for having to go through the EA launcher my review might be different, having to stare at a white screen that says ""EA"" for 30 minutes just to load into an already poorly optimized game is sort of a letdown. 
Horrible frame drops, laggy servers, and the maps themselves are mid at best. Play Hell Let Loose instead."
Trash
better on xbox one....
"bought it when it was on sale, got what i paid for"
"I pre-ordered this game on Origin. To this day, it is still my least favorite Battlefield game."
"not even for 2,5 EUR. should have bought a cheeseburger instead"
"""Please start this app from EA application.""

Do not buy this anymore. They require you to use your shitty launcher."
It's still full of bugs. I playes twice and each time I loose progress. Even settings are not saved. Even with 95% I can't recommend it.
"Campaign is worth 2 dollars, barely. You play 4 different ""campaigns"", the first three are copy paste, go to this place destroy this thing, then go to the next place destroy that thing. The last campaign is the only thing close to a linear campaign and its barely that, because you get to drive around in a tank and actually participate in the war. finished the game in 10 hours."
"Тупые блядские уебки, если вы считаете что при каждом запуске игры я мечтаю хуярить в пролог вы глубоко не то что ошибаетесь,а в пиздец каком ебаном неведении.Уебки игре 7 лет,а эту хуйню не исправили"
Removed Linux support.
despite being on steam you still have to deal with EA shitware
傻逼EA我曹寺你的🐎
"EA游戏我不敢一口气买很多然后屯着空闲时才打开了，必须买一个，立马安装看看能否进入，不行就立即退款。

吐槽下在STEAM上买的多个EA游戏都无法打开，就是没有进入游戏玩过。"
"amazing visuals and sound design made by very talented people but unfortunately sullied by not being able to disable the loud screaming women. game is obviously incredibly a-historical on all levels, which is fine because the game is pretty fun anyway, but having to constantly hear high pitched screams and yelling from not so talented voice actors isn't for everyone :)"

5/10
EAlancher is not work
"EA App is a nuisance, doesn't work most of the time"
uuuugh
"boring, tanks run the game"
"For some reason i am banned from almost every single server in this game. The only servers i can join are asian or oceanian servers where i have 200+ ping.

But onto the actual game itself, since i have played it on origins a few years ago, and is STILL complete garbage:

-As with every battlefield game, it is absolutely overflowing with cheaters with every single cheat imaginable, aimbot, ESP, godmode, invisibility, teleportation, no-clip, ETC.
-Not only that but the game is just as unbalanced as BF1 with OP guns that have 10000 fire rate and perfect accuracy and control. Oh and shotguns are still toxic and overpowered and should be removed.
-Garbage and exaggerated animations make it hard to shoot enemies who are sprinting or jogging since the model flails around like a inflatable arm-flailing tube man.
-Movement system is retarded as you can just hop around like a bunny at full speed and be unkillable while still having perfect accuracy and gun handling.
-Maps suck dong and is basically the same formula over and over again where you die from snipers all the time.
-Practice mode does not let you select your class or select which weapons you use. Seriously...
-Dumbass Cosmetics and paid models in the game are ridiculous and shouldn't be a thing. Over half of the ""Soldiers"" you will see in this game are the old Kriegsmarine general in his bright blue ceremonial outfit, or the imperial Japanese lady with tight fitting leggings and a tank top. While being able to customize your soldiers face and uniform is cool, most of the models are wildly inaccurate and look like they are something from the modern Call of Duty and completely ruins any sense of realism and just shows that the game does not take itself seriously.

Its just your average EA/DICE classic where they clearly don't care about their game or their playerbase and make the worst decisions possible while creating their game.

Bought it for 2 dollars and it is not even worth 1 penny. Refunded."
some guy's baby kept crying over the mic in my squad
its playing a game where everyone is a sniper hiding in every corner they find
game can not load
"i mean like its decent. just got stale after a while of playing, maps started getting old and boring to play on, guns started feeling quite boring, i was tired of the constant hackers/sweats constantly, the game just doesnt feel the same anymore.

And to be honest i wouldnt recommend it, only took around 13 hours of gameplay until i was just purely bored playing it"
In 2024 EA updated the game to require kernel-level anticheat to run. Would never have purchased the game if I knew this was going to happen. I just want to play the singleplayer campaign and there's no way I'll let 3rd party tamper with my OS kernel.
ea永远安装不了
EA servers are just terrible...game is good tho
neidomus
I bought this piece of ♥♥♥♥ when it was on sale for 3.50€
"As a new Aisan player I don't like this game because is I saw many Chinese or Asian players used hack aim bot ruined my gameplay. I can do nothing other than report them to Developers but they're not banned yet                
My experience was ruined by these cheaters 
Please do something STUPID DICE & EA"
"Was thinking of returning to this game until moron EA said ""mE aDd nEw AnTi ChEaT tO mAkE uNpLaYaBlE oN sTeAm DeAk CuZ mE a FiNg MoRoN"" -EA probably"
Horrendous Online game play. Apparently this hot garbage is meant to be played that way. Who came up with this BS
Fun game but I would rather stick my fist in horse shit than try to reopen and set up this game after a reinstall
Will not install.
"i live in Australia and this game has no OCE servers and there is no way to check this prior to purchase. 

i will request a refund and help OCE players figure this out before purchasing it.

best latency avaliable is 158ms so 1.58 seconds delay check screen shots i have loaded up."
"I'm not fucking paying all of that money for some cosmetics dude
The campaign is alright but it isnt as epic as I'd hoped"
Get rid of the EA launcher and than maybe ill play it

"modern shooter dogshit slop shovelware. 
probably one of the worst battlefields there is. no cover. bad weapons. dogshit aiming."
"Matchmaking sucks. Every game is a landslide and being on the opposite team is draining. Games are done within 15 minutes, vehicles killing you as you spawn sucks. War is brutal."
The game doesn't boot up at all!
the flying controls are sh1t and tons of cheaters
unplayable due to crashes
shit game. Remove tanks plzz
"""Stiff Ragdoll Physics Ruin Immersion""
While Battlefield V excels in visuals, sound design, and large-scale multiplayer battles, the lackluster ragdoll physics are a glaring disappointment. Dead bodies fall like lifeless mannequins, stiff and unnatural, completely breaking immersion in an otherwise realistic war setting.

For a game that prides itself on attention to detail — from destructible environments to historically inspired battles — it’s baffling that death animations feel so outdated. In chaotic firefights, this issue becomes even more apparent, making the battlefield feel lifeless rather than dynamic.

It’s clear that the developers prioritized performance and flashy destruction over basic physics realism, which is a shame. I can’t help but feel they could have done better in this area, especially with the Frostbite engine’s capabilities. If immersion is important to you, this might leave you disappointed."
"idiotic game, developers have forgotten this game:("
"game is good but the comunity is extremely toxic, very poor balancing of guns like type 2a and zh29, just turn the chat off"
Servers filled by cheaters.
Trash game cheaters...
piece of crap
"check my review on battlefield 2042 but this game is now plagued with a weird bug that will turn on ""share player usage data"" without notifying you, meaning that it forcibly collects data without player consent. Don't risk your data to EA. They should be investigated by the FTC for such shady practices."
the server is very bad
This is from Sydney server view but this game used to be so good on console when there was so many more servers that were damn near full but now I can only pick up 1 full or no players at all. the feel is pretty nostalgic but doesn't feel like battlefield that I remember this would be a cop if you play in larger regions but if you play in a small like me then it's a drop sadly.
GOOD EA!!!!!!
.
"As with all the other titles in the series these are great games, massively let down by a developer and a publisher who do nothing about the rampant cheat/hacks or the horrendous abusive language in the chat. Another case of a game that deserves better than the calibre of people in its fanbase."
The amount of little hacker fkrs in this game IS crazy. Then you got no life trash lvl 500 players OMFG. SO sad from the start of battlefield 20 years ago.
I only spent a dollar on this game and it still wasn't worth it. I regret wasting even just one dollar on this game. Hackers are everywhere and so are snipers and tanks. Get rid of snipers and tanks and this game could be decent.
"vehicle simulator, shoots peas unless its a head shot or a rifle, vehicle simulator, leveling and customization is jus all wrong, vehicle simulator, cant kill tanks for ish as a soldier which why even make a tank killer class if it cant take out tanks, vehicle simulator, maps design and flag placements are either ur straight winning or straight losing unless u somehow manage to get a god send lobby and it actually feels like ur fighting for the map, did i mention this might as well be world of tanks.


The little good this game has is so good. the maps themselves look absolutely amazing, teams are def better than ""no pats"", guns look and sound really nice, some of the game mechanics need to be brought back like yesterday, actually being able to hide from and enemy is really nice and vice versa, the roll over when aiming behind u when prone, the run crouched, the satisfying head shot sound, the realism is so nice, unfortunately im infected with liking battlefield so i will put more unnecessarly fustrating hours into what this is."
waste of money ea will restrict you with anti cheat errors from time to time. dont buy any of the games that need anti cheat.
"The hackers, the gameplay, the performance, the graphics, all vastly worse than Battlefield 1, just buy battlefield 1."
"Battlefield 5's multiplayer is one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had in a Battlefield game. Unbalanced teams, cheaters, etc...."
EW
Matchmaking is bad
No Eastern front =(((((
"Сюжет короткий, онлайн мертвый, игра вылетает не смотря ни на какое железо."
game so ass sobbing emoji pls pllay bf1
"I don't usually rate games but I feel like I need to this time

-The amount of bugs from the ai enemies and allies made me want to KILL MYSELF 
-The ungodly 11/10 vision of the enemies spotting you from 2km away while you're behind 5 layers of pure solid concrete makes it impossible to be stealthy like damn I don't even need to go into multiplayer to see cheaters
-Bland campaign story, it's definitely not bad, but it's definitely blander than the pasta I make at 3am. Fakeass stories
-If you love history and historical accuracy, then this game is your worst enemy

On a brighter note :
-cool realistic graphics
-you can blow up stuff 

Don't buy this shit unless it's on a big sale like -90%, I bought it on sale and I don't regret loosing like idk 3-7 bucks to this, but I would have regretted it if I had bought it on full price
Arbitrary score: 4.5/10 






(and i finished the game in extreme difficulty but steam is too scared to give me the achievement)"
Not worth the money. You will find a game then when it ends and goes to another map 90% of the players leave.
ihan vitun huono peli
"Много читеров. Странные и неудобные геймдизайнерские решения. Рудиментарная прокачка. Проблема с поиском серверов - через автопоиск кидает на полупустые или с ""ожиданием игроков"", в то время как в браузере с нормальным пингом по утрам всего один сервер."
"-It requires the trash EA app
-Woke and fake WW2 stories
-The graphics are somehow worse than BF1
-The multiplayer is full of hackers. Don't even bother
-Bad level design and AI with lots of bugs and glitches"
"The good;
- Campaign puts in effort to tell a story beyond gunfire and explosions.
- Campaign shows parts of the war which we don't often see, such as Norway (as opposed to the usual D-Day, Market Garden & Stalingrad portrayals).
- Graphics are nice.
- The sounds is also nice; guns sound lethal which also helps with immersion.

The bad;
- Loads of historical inaccuracies. Not just minor ones, but major ones as well. This game is pure fantasy and put so little effort in historical accuracy that it's almost disrespectful to the people that actually fought and lived through the war.
- Stories in the campaign are overdramatised making the stories feel fake and the characters feel unrelatable.
- Animations of characters feel off. Movement feels weird, both in your own FPV and in other characters. Movements are very exaggerated.
- Gunplay is very unrealistic and also illogical. Damage dealt is almost entirely unrelated to the power of the round or the place where someone got hit. Instead, some enemies have more or less health based on their role. 
- Ballistics are all off. Bulletdrop and ballistic effects have been dramaticly increased compared to what they would be IRL. The result is having to heavily correct your aim. Damage over distance is terrible and enemies beyond 100 meters need as many as 10-15 rounds even from full sized machineguns firing 7.92
- The AI is very poor.
- The game doesn't have the sandbox/skirmish mode for PvE, despite that having been a staple of Battlefield games.

This review covers singleplayer. I haven't gotten to multiplayer yet and with the way it's been going I'm not sure if I ever will.
This is my personal view on the game, as someone that cares a lot about historical accuracy, realism and immersion. If you enjoy more arcade style shooters, chances are you will like this game more than I did..

I got the game for 3 or 4 euro's on a sale. For that price, I guess I can't complain. But I can say I now fully understand why this game was so cheap despite being from 2018 and from a major game company. If you want to try this game, buy it during sale and expect to be disappointed."
Reinstalled can't open DUM DUM EA retard game
"got scammed by ea, ofc"
Can no longer play it on Linux.
"Review for SinglePlayer stories only:

Ridiculious, unauthentic, bad plot, lame character writing, ahistoric


Requested a refund."
Que jogo mais péssimo. Como é que uma franquia dessas conseguiu decair tanto.
"EA, you stupid Boyi, what the are you doing with the ban? I'm a newbie and I'll be sealed after playing the first one.,Are you a must-raise EA or aren't you? If you don't know how to do it, don't do it, and it is recommended to reopen."
game crashes every time I try to play it even at lowest settings trust me I played it 2 months ago in maxed settings it didnt even lag but now it just crashes and lags a lot
"This game is so bad rather play the new warzone than the ""Firestorm"""
"Daca as avea un dusman ,i as da gift acest joc.Muie EA"
"as fun as this game is, there's still way too many hackers running around ruining the fucking game"
Still waiting for a medic
"Dumbass game with a decent play style, though. Unreal stories, missing story parts of WWII, Cheaters won't get banned, and few servers are playable. Every time the game is on sale, a bunch of new idiots rush in so the veteran players can have their fun. It was great when the game was first published, and the DICE team was like they got brain cancer or something. They decided to make another shitty game BF2042, which I requested for a refund after 10 mins playtime. Respawn points are dumb as hell, either far away and become moving targets, either too close, or just respawn right on the enemy's face."
Nein
"it is quite buggy and some actions of NPC are very illogical that makes the whole experience very artificial.

Also no ukrainian translation is bit disappointing."
"Unfortunately I have to downvote this game and Valve itself. It is my first negative review as I usually consider the effort of the developers. But now...
They added a kernel level anti cheat program that I cannot agree to install for security concerns and this game is not launching anymore. Had I known before I would have never purchased the game. They just ignore my refund request.
Someone seems happy of the new anticheat but others like me are very unhappy of the unpleasant situation. When you deploy such an impactful change you should give your customer the right to choose if continue playing the game or receive a refund."
"Want to love it, but nah, Campaign is bad, Movement is bad, Plane's are actually unusable compared to like BF4, Unoptimized, Cheaters, Guns are not balanced at all, snipers are the only real usable weapon, Just generally janky and unfinished in the terms of everything really."
"The historical inaccuracies really pull you out of it and ruin the experience and atmosphere of the game. It's like if a game was set in Victorian London and someone pulled out a smartphone and asked you to text them. In short:

What this game needs is fewer women and more swastikas."
"Bullshit game. but the  last tiger is peak campaign. 

online is awful and unbalanced. snipers forces u to play sniper instead other roles. scks godzilla's  dck"
"If you're looking for multiplayer, just play BF1"
Inconsistent ttk and at least 1 cheater in every game.
"using cheats in this game is free , 90% of players are using cheats , dont waste yout time and your money on this shit game"
"poorly maintain, tons of hacker"
"Time to kill feels off, sometimes it's too fast, other times too slow. 
movement is also way too animated, makes it genuinely confusing to shoot at people sometimes.
You can go prone in a way that makes you look like a dead body.
Recoil impulse feels extremely cheap and flat, like it's the camera itself creating artificial recoil while your gun flimsily shakes around.
Map visibility is horrendously bad on most, and a bunch of them are also way too big with too many angles to look at. 
Player base is extremely demented and will either make you laugh or rage. 
Planes are really broken and have way too much HP so taking them down is a CHORE. 
The cosmetics are terrible for the most part, and are not restricted to classes, so you can make each one look identical. 
Gun distribution is a stupid mess, why are shotguns only on the support??
Tank controls are decent.
The whole gun specialisation system is neat, but half of the perks feel copy pasted and utterly uninspired and boring.
Game is missing multiple historic guns actually used in the war like the WZ.35 AT rifle, FB Vis.35, MP-41, M1891 Carcano, M1903 Springfield, Breda 30, Owen Gun, Nagant M1895, FN Browning 1900, Browning Hi-Power, M1917 Revolver, TT33 Tokarev, PPSh-43 and PPSh-41, Nambu Pistol, Lancaster SMG, Berthier Rifle, SVT-40, MAS-36 Rifle, Hamada Type-1, ZB wz.26, Mors vz.39, DP-28, M1941 Johnson LMG, basically zero Russian guns (I DO NOT care if Russia was never added as a faction, there is NO EXCUSE) and I probably missed a few more guns but you get the gist.

A lot of obscure and stupid prototypes like the Type 3A (named 2A for some reason) took priority over these historically used firearms, on top of the fact that the devs lazily recycled like 1/3 of the guns from BF1. 

So all in all what can I say uh..
Least the shotguns feel nice?

4/10
It just isn't a competent FPS, or a competent Battlefield title. 1 and previous titles are better, but this one is better than 2042 (lol)."
Woke bs
"very worst multiplayer mode...lot of cheaters ..fast running cheat, prefire cheat, aimbots , one shot cheat..etc"
"Disable the fucking planes
Sweats are camping them and as soon as you spawn as a plane or tank they spawnkill you"
Just really unfun
"Hackers every game, at least 1 every game. Story mode is lackluster. Chat spamming bots which EA will never do anything about."
"tiger in norway in 1940 xddd and this is only prologue, waiting for aliens or zombie naz*st"
"Multiplayer from what ive experienced is riddle with cheaters would not recommend, if you like story then i would recommend"
EA CONNECTION FAILED
Literally the worst BF game ever.
"Not a complete review, but f*ck this game. I didn't need to get far to see some telltale sins of game design. Needing yet another separate acct and client for EA was a bad sign, but other good games like RDR2 need that shit as well, so ok. The first campaign, the intro, gives a wonderful demo of just how awfully everything controls, from vehicles to the player. And then when the second episode starts, the cinematic BS (which I only tolerate in minimal doses anyway ... unless it's REALLY well done, which in this game, it's not particularly well done), during that cinematic BS, the graphics start stuttering and jumping around. My rig (Ryzen 9 5900, 64 GB RAM, RTX 4070 Ti Super 16GB VRAM ... that is not a setup that should have any difficulty) .... ok, fine, some graphics settings need tuning ... but can you escape to an options screen during the cinematic ... NO. No it won't let you. Piss off EA and piss off with your contempt for your audience. Uninstalling. Glad I only spent $5 on this POS."
"Battlefield 5 is a ""fun"" & ""forgiving"" experience compare to Battlefield 1, that is a true fact when it comes to multiplayer side of things.

But the campaign is by far, the most unfun, recycled to death experience I ever played. Stealth after stealth, open ended objectives after open ended objective, 2 levels are literally using the same format. Man do they forgot how to space out similar content.

Other than that, it is the most bland experience I ever had, there's nothing outstanding at all. I know WW2 was done to death at this point, so there's your bias. Except its not true. (COD: WaW campaign is still the most memorable experience, deal with it)


In short, Battlefield 5 has the most cut-n-dry experience I ever had, besides the more impressive Frostbite engine upgrade, its literally nothing outstanding at all. Let alone the character skin controversy, that's not the biggest issue here, as the issue being the gameplay that is dry as hell."
excessive foliage and bad map design makes me a vietnam war vet.
To many Women for WW2
Only if it's on sale.
"""WWII"" game with no USSR, soldier can survive a direct impact from a 250kg bomb on ""hardcore"" difficulty in the campaign. Typical EA trash."
It doesnt work on steam deck.
"Just.. awful. Buggy mess. Boring. I bought this during the super sale to revisit the campaign and having just finished BF1, which was absolutely incredible, to move to this.. I'm just confused. How could it have gone so wrong."
shtit
Its a disgrace to history and all the men that fought and died in World War Two. Its abandoned trash with a decent enough multiplayer to keep players playing. but apart from that its a burning pile of sh*t that bugs out every single second.
can’t play multiplayer
"With the amount of automatic rifles, and experimental weapons never used in combat, this game does not feel like a World War Two game whatsoever. With almost everyone playing as these almost Call Of Duty Warzone - like characters that do not fit the timeline or even the faction you are playing as, the game feels more like Fortnite. The ""Campaign"" consists of ""Go from Point A to Point B Stealthily"" for 2 hours. If you're looking for an accurate World War Two game, play a game like Hell Let Loose."
HORRIBLE GAME I CANT EVEN PLAY AND MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAVE THE  SAME ISSUE IT CRASHES AFTER LAUNCH.FIX THIS FUYCKING GAME I HAVE TRIED ALL THE FIXES BUT DID NOT WORK.
"I can only speak for the single player, but that was just terrible. The actual gameplay is basically the same as it was in earlier games, but the characters and story are just awful. If it gets better in later parts I do not know but as far as I got they were just dull juvenile cliches. I prefer to play a game through before forming an opinion but honestly, I just couldn't be bothered."
This game is not even worth the 3 euros. I have played for 19 hours and the sheer amount of unrealism is massive. How can a living human being tank 5 50. cal rounds to the chest or a direct hit from a PIAT. You need to empty a half of your magazine to just kill one soldier. The only weapons that do damage are shotguns at close range or AT rifles and even from the AT rifles a soldier is able to tank 2 rounds to the leg. The weapons are like airsoft but weaker and the rest is what you would expect from a battlefield.
"As for Multiplayer, it has some good mechanics, and the graphics are nice. but the gunplay.......... its horrid. and dont get me started with getting constantly bombed by planes... i wish i could like this game but i really cannot reccomend it, its predecessor Battlefield 1 was leagues above this game and it feels like it was made with passion. this game feels like its just a shitty version of 1. The only good aspect is visuals."
this entire game is ether dying to recon sitting on the other side of the map or tanks on the other side of the map
"This game is one of the games that sits in the library not be played for weeks. I feel that a very specific type of person plays something like this, which is fine (however) most people that I know don't have fun... at all. The story is very compelling or interesting... I get that but if the story isn't the point the mechanics should be. The controls and handing are very very very slow and rough. It feels like the player isn't in full control and the WAR IN THE PACIFIC mode is one of the main reasons I bought this. However the lobbies are always empty. So this disappointed me very much, however it has some good qualities that players can enjoyed such as the scenery and 1940s vibe."
This game is very good in term of graphic and gameplay but there is one thing that i am always frustrated when i am playing this game there are to many hacker and i cant have fun
"Whew what a stinker over here.

For reference, I played this game after playing Battlefield 1.

The gamemodes

What is the difference between strategic conquest and tactical conquest? The game fails to explain this and lazily puts the same tutorial video on both. So far my guess is the map variety. Tactical conquest only has British vs German maps while Strategic conquest has that and USA vs Japan maps. Another difference I noticed is that strategic conquest has huge spacing in between objectives. Why is this the major difference between gamemodes? Wow, I really like getting sniped in the middle of nowhere before reaching the next objective. Oh- I should be in transport vehicles? Well then I really like getting blown up in the middle of nowhere while some guy roughly 100 kilometers away gets a quadruple kill.

The maps

The overall color palette is bright and colorful. Why is a video game about war bright and colorful? The maps in tactical conquest are more of the battlefield experience I am used to, but with a more linear approach to map design. All it takes is for someone to memorize all of the choke points in the map to farm kills. The map I probably hate the most is that one desert market map. This map is basically a TDM arena map but for 120 players where everyone gets funneled into a 10 v 10 experience.

The Censorship

This is something anyone can easily poke fun at- which is why I'll make this section brief. The in-game chat has a heavy filter that is inconsistent at best. For example, You can't say ""nazi"" even though the Gemrans in WWII were that but you can say ""grammar nazi"". Sometimes it bugs out and hides random words that aren't really offensive which makes team communication a chore.

Animations in general are sometimes weird an uncomfortable. I don't know how to put it, but it is like everything is unnatural stiff and rigid.

Fire just feels useless.

The community feels dead even though the servers are almost always full 24/7.

There are no moderators. As a result, actual hackers do get on to ruin everyone's day. For example, I hopped into a lobby and a hacker was spamming redeploy to everyone in the whole lobby. Battlefield 1 doesn't have this.

And finally, I just want to note how in the maps, the German symbols and the Japanese flag are incorrect.


On the bright side, plane fighting is pretty cool and shooting them out of the sky with tanks is quite enjoyable.

Anyways, I would recommend playing Battlefield 1 first so you have an enjoyable time before playing this hot mess."
Visual are not much different than Battlefield 1 and yet it run far worse even on lowest setting for GTX 1050. Meanwhile Battlefield 1 can run quite great on GTX1050 with good visual graphic.
"A sad affair indeed.

I mean, the game itself is AMAZING. The graphics are top notch, the mechanics are what I would expect from an online ""war type PvP game"", but sadly no one is online playing this game with a PC.

I did some research and it seems EA has taken NO STEPS to address the hacker community in this game.

Apparently this game is very vulnerable to hacking software and allows cheaters to simply ""one shot"" you from across the map.

I mean, it is a great strategy sure, and it works, but is not in the spirit of an online PvP match scenario. 

And if I may say this behavior is only prevalent in these types of games because of the monetization of streaming services that create followers through ""winners"".

These ""winners"" just hack to get their  rankings and then sell their stream to get ratings for cash.

Don't get me wrong, there are some real players out there, but they are far and few between.

A fair game is a fair game, but it seems hackers have decided to destroy that ideal because they have nothing better to do than to torment the players and the company until success is no longer an option; and they do it for profit.

Sad indeed.

But... C'est la vie.

I do not recommend this game as it is solely based on multiplayer mode and the online experience is just horrendous.

If a company is going to base their sole business model based on online play, I would have imagined they would have created a more fair playing field for their players.

What a failure.

I am so sad for this because the game is BEAUTIFUL.

It is just a tragedy that the world will not continue to enjoy it because the devs and the publishers were lackluster lazy fucks that didn't give a fuck about anything past their MTX and pre-purchase profit.

It's fucking laughable.

If you are going to play this game I recommend playing through a console (and turning off cross platform) based upon the lack of security there is in the PC version.

That is what I am doing."
"IT RESETS SETTINGS ON RESTART!

I absolutely did not expect such common mistakes from AAA studio with more than dosen of years of experience! It lunches with low resolution/frame rate on first start, doesn't allow to change graphics before some action starts (it also a very common mistake, it is not acceptable for a AAA shooter), and some options are requiring game to relaunch. And after relaunch, everything is reset to default!

I've completed the first action sequence and relaunched the game after, all of the settings were default and I HAD TO COMPLETE THE SEQUENCE AGAIN!

Absolute garbage user experience from veterans of the game industry, feels like i got spat in the face."
EA moment
"this shit suck,can't even go to the main menu."
game is fun but cheaters on almost every game
This game is turbo-ass. 0/10
Server connections are teriible and doesnt even come close to BF3
"I was surprised how many skill trees there were for guns and vehicles, BUT, the Asia region is filled with Chinese hackers. So the game is completely unplayable in that region"
it could be better...too many cheaters redeploying the server every few games
honestly pretty bad
"EA security is too broken, i wouldn't recommend"
"On PC alone I've clocked nearly 70 hours, and I bet my whole life that 20% of that entire playtime is trying to get this damn shitshow to even run. For fuck's sake EA you cant do a single thing right can you? not in BF1, 2042, or this bullshit"
horrible
"EA/Dice games are infested with Cheaters, the new EA anti cheat didn't do anything good except to ban the Linux platform. Ignore EA/Dice games if your looking to keep your sanity."
do not play this game
"does not look like trailer at all, not even close"
I really hate that I paid money for this
"Fortnite damage model. 7 shots with a 30-06 rifle to take someone down assuming they don't start jumping and powersliding around to dodge your bullets. Slow respawn times, your exact location shown to enemies even if you're behind cover, no chance to survive in any vehicle that isn't fully upgraded. Flares put you on the enemy's minimap even if you're underground, anti-tank weapons totally useless, reinforcements take the entire round to earn, mounted guns overheat in 15 shots. Footsteps are louder than a Tiger's engine. 200% ""hardcore"" servers fixed all of this, but nobody hosts those anymore.

EA+Dice have abandoned this game, only caring about nicking players for saying non-PC things in chat. Lax / Strict ping moderation removed from server operator's options so expect everyone to have 150ms+ latency."
"I dislike the volume of hackers.  its all aim-bots.  If i want to be fondled and assaulted, i can get that for free at the local park.  EA will never see another dime from me."
"TL;DR - Probably the worst Battlefield Game to date, fighting 2042 and Hardline for 1st. It sucks for old timer battlefield players. And if EA wanted to make an FPS to draw in players who'd never played FPS's before or were new in general, they failed. 

I've been a battlefield veteran for many years and Battlefield 4 was a game I enjoyed so much that I actually purchased it three times for each of the compatible systems I had for it (the PS3, the PS4 when I upgraded, and PC). I've been playing since Battlefield 2 and the franchise was very near and dear to my heart. Naturally when all of the dumb stuff EA was doing with the franchise came to a head in Battlefield V, I skipped it. I wasn't going to give it the time of day and everything I saw about reaffirmed that it wasn't going to be worth the cost of entry. Years later, however, with it on sale for three bucks and with the knowledge Battlefield games often take years to polish up, I decided to pick it up. And boy howdy, it's rough.

For starters all of the unrealistic aspects are here. The weapons aren't faction locked, women are just as numerous on the battlefield as the men, you can play things like a black women amongst the Germans (just lmao on that one), and that sort of thing. There's also a cosmetic system reminiscent of some of the more recent CoD and battle royal titles. These range from really interesting to 'meh' to absolutely goofy and immersion breaking. However if you're willing to let that slide... the fundamental moment to moment gameplay experience just isn't good.

I recall at the time that for reasons only known to God and EA they wanted to make a game that 'non FPS players would enjoy' looking specifically to female players. The way they chose to do this was by the cosmetic factors mentioned above and by hand crafting a tutorial that was somehow simultaneously handholdy and uninformative. They explain the concept of capture the flag and ticket counts no less than four times. Something that even nine year old me (who was NOT a very smart kid, mind you) was able to figure out through context clues. The tutorial is missing, however: vehicle driving, the ENTIRELY NEW TO BATTLEFIELD building mechanic, bullet drop, throwing back grenades, and all sorts of other things that someone brand new to FPS's would *actually* need help with. 

The rest of the gameplay continues the unhappy marriage of the alleged goal of attracting non FPS players and adhering to old battlefield fans. The Time to kill and bleedout timers are some of the lowest in the franchise and are incredibly punishing for newer players. Things like the passive resupply caches and other easy 'help the team and learn the game' items that would be useful for a less mechanically inclined player are just gone. Things that could have been added to help newer players like letting them crawl to a better spot to be revived or getting something of a kill cam (to explain how and why they were killed) are also not here. The maps feel absurdly small for Battlefield and WWII alike and considering half the assets in this game were blatantly ripped right out of Battlefield 1 you'd think they'd of borrowed some of the larger maps as well. As it stands you're often corralled into very narrow playspaces where newer players are chewed up and spit out on the regular. 

For the flip side for long standing battlefield players the lack of strategic choices in most maps is painfully obvious and there's very little in the way of interesting strategies as almost all of the classes have been filed down to have a large portion of their identity removed. Anti-tank weapons are largely ineffective and the battlefield is dominated by a handful of select weapons so progression is simply not all that present especially since the game tends to come with the 'starter packs' now. Weapon selection is very small despite weapons not being locked to faction. Many of the additional gadgets and gizmos aren't all that interesting either with staples of the franchise that were carried over into 1 just being missing. Entire factions are missing even years later. The Russians aren't here. The French aren't here. The Italians aren't here. It's USA, Germany, Japan, and the UK. That's it. It's honestly kind of embarrassing, especially with the wide derth of peoples and factions represented in battlefield 1 even on release. This is the most content light battlefield to date and you can feel that in every menu.

So. EA managed to craft an experience that drove most of your old school battlefield players away and ended up unironically harsher for new players to learn than previous title entries because EA seems to think the way to encourage first time FPS'ers is to explain simple concepts like they might be developmentally disabled and then not explain anything else. So whats the remaining community like? A bunch of whiny, constantly crying about ""hackers"" salty toxic ingrates who spend more time throwing slurs in chat than they do playing the game. There is no team balancing. Matches are universally one sided stomps across the board, and there's more salt in your average /all chat per match than an actual salt quarry in Utah. 


It's sad. Really. Had this had an actually competent leadership team behind it who were willing to let the devs work, had the lead devs not been ideologically poisoned against their own franchise's history, if EA could not be EA for a grand total of 12 minutes, this could have been a great game. This could have gone down in history as one of the best multiplayer WWII games on the market. Hell, it could have been great for new battlefield players and new FPS players as well if they actually sat down and thought about what players new to FPS's might actually need instead of taking wild potshot guesses that anyone with an IQ above seven should have recognized as stupid. Instead, it goes down as one of the final death knells of a once beloved franchise. Do not buy this game. Not even for three dollars. If you were to take those three dollars and buy nothing but gumballs to lodge in your rectum, it'll be money better spent.  Go buy an older entry in the series, or find another WWII game on the market. There's plenty and MOST outshine what this is."
this game is trash got it for 4 dollars and still wanna refund its buggy the story mode is so bad like this is a lazy failed cash grab
fix your game
"Hideous mouse feel, I find it nearly impossible to aim. Mouse settings and raw input on make no difference. The mouse feels filtered and laggy to kingdom come and back, I simply cannot aim at all and I play dozens of other shooters where I don't feel that issue."

the game is completliy dead it said 17k people playing but i played 71mins not even 1 match played"
Garbage game loaded with cheaters
"battlefield 1 is better, target recognition in 5 is so hard and i was dying too many times and without seeing where i was getting shot from, and yes i am a seasoned and experienced bf player, 200+ hours in bf1"
Trash
Don't waste the time it takes to download it.
Game launcher bugged and resets my progress each time i launch the game. After trying everything it nothing works. EA deserves their downfall
Dogshit game
"The TTK of this game is so off that everything that isn't a high firerate SMG or a splash damage shell from a tank or plane just isn't worth using. Somehow this also includes all LMGs which they inexplicably gave maximum magazines of 50 or less. Do NOT buy this game, you could just be playing Battlefield One, Bf4 or even Bf3 instead which are just better games unfortunately."
"Game is fine, sadly the community is cheating for MP.  From clip shot kills to tag headshot kills.  The game has about 9 out of 10 players cheating and those that aren't are getting slammed.  EA did a study and found 65% are cheating on all there MP games.  Sadly Microsoft is a big part of the blame with Directx holes still never patched for over 30 years now.  Unless you want to play the boring single player it's waste of funds, I'd try BF4 for the single player and BF1 well it's full of same cheating.  Otherwise game on elsewhere."
"Kernel level anti-cheat does absolute jackshit. Even when it works normally about 70% of the maps are terrible 

Just buy BF1"
"im using ReWASD tool for my games who didn't support controller and this stupid game didn't want to get launched and it ask me to close the tool if i have to play it so closed the reWASD tool and tried to start the game and then it asked me to restart my PC...GUYS DO DONT BUY THIS TRASH GAME, I HAVE MANY GAMES AND I NEVER GOT THIS STUPID ERROR BUT ONLY FROM THOSE BASTARDS WHO THINK THEY CAN LET ME DELET MY TOOL TO PLAY THEIR TRASH SHOOTER GAME...IN YOUR DREAM"
"I would've given this a middle rating if I could because the campaign is absolute dogshit, but can be pretty fun. I waited an entire night for this game to download, and when i got to play it this morning, i was bamboozled to find out that, even on easy mode, you take a shit ton of damage, and on top of that, the stealth mechanics are janky as fuck. Plus, the destruction mechanics are worse than in BF1, which came out 2 years prior to this, and they reused so many things from BF1 anyway, making it worse. This game is literally the Halo 5 of Battlefield."
"schlechtes gameplay, schlechte team8s noch schlechtere wafen mechanics"
it is a good game but the pacing is horrendes feels like call of duty.
i cant even play the god damn game
"Garbage publisher that publishes breaking changes. Does not work anymore, go to hell thieving EA."
I hope to never play such a garbage game where apparently enemy has all the better items than you.
"As much as I tried liking this game,it just didn't feel right to me,maybe I'm not into Battlefield and I'd much rather prefer Call of Duty,but this one seriously lacks quality and it's most evident in its single-player ""campaign"" broke down into 4 different War Stories that are each worse than the other with the exception of The Last Tiger which is the better of the bunch,but far from a stellar experience.Ironic that the only ""good"" campaign has you play as the Axis.Awful stories aside,the gameplay isn't any better as you have generic objectives to complete and ""stealth"" your way to them in the most bs way I've ever seen,with enemies seeing you from a mile away and guys operating turrets that won't fucking die.The campaigns in general are basically glorified tutorials that unfortunately reminded me of that horrible BF2 campaign,which is honestly better than this piece of crap,As for the multiplayer,I haven't seen so many campers in a game since MW2 and hackers run rampant destroying any last piece of hope I had for this.It may be fun ocasionally,but as a whole I wouldn't recommend touching this unless you are a die-hard fan of WW2 or don't want to spend a whole bunch on a game,but only on sale as it's just not worth the hassle to pay full price for this dissapointment. 5/10"
👎
"Cool game, really polished decently toward the end of its life, with a decent amount of content. I MIGHT recommend getting it if it is on discount, and if you're a fan of Battlefield and WWII stuff, but I can't. This is for the sole reason that there are cheaters/hackers/aim-botters whatever you want to call them, in their servers. Nothing at all makes playing a competitive game online worth it when dealing with literal cheaters. I had heard that this was an issue for ages in the PC community, but thought that DICE/EA had implemented some sort of anti-cheat that worked."
"I cannot run the game at all. Tried so many things
- Set compatibility mode and display
- Remove BFV from registry editor and reinstall it
- Uninstall and install EA App and BFV
- Delete the environment variables that has ""GAME ID"" or something

PS: I just bought my laptop. i didnt install any malicious software whatsoever."
"cheaters, out of the mind teammates. Battlefield 1 is better."
"Online - to many sweats
Story - bad telling, i set it on ""easy mode"" cant get past one damn level without dying multiple times 

1/10 game"
Battlefield 1 does almost everything pretty much better than this
"this game is full of bugs, you can't save the progress. I wasted 3 hours. The sniper 4 and 5 are much better. Don't waste your money on this."
"Invest in good anti-cheat that doesn't block Linux players, but I guess that's what greed leads to."
FIX YOUR GAME
bleh
"If, like me, you wanted to pick this up for 3.99 just to play the singleplayer campaign, don't bother. it's just, just awful. All I can say is, it is very clear that they did not make this game with single player in mind at all, which I figured. Still, for 3.99 I thought it might be worth it. It's just not, it's not worth it for free, it's a waste of your time and hard drive space, and it makes you install EA crap. There is clearly TONS more time and effort put into the short cutscenes between the missions than the missions themselves. Use that 3.99 and buy some cheap vodka, then drink it with your cat. That will be infinitely more engaging."
its a battlefield my main compliant is with the planes its very shaky and i think its cool it adds a lot of action but i can barely see anything when im turning the ground game play is okay its not the best no weapons are beginner friendly having high recoil the only weapons with okay recoil suck and the tank game play is okay and if you go against a tank you are most likely screwed tanks are so broken if left with nothing to counter it and if there is its not reliable the assault class is okay the panzerfaust has only two rounds and you gotta hit the tank in the right location to actually deal damage the dynamyte is better against people and the cqb combat is aids anyone with a shotgun wins if they have good aim and if they can even use the weapons due to the recoil overall 3/10 game would not recommend this game is only for people who hate themselves.(battlefield 4 is way better)
piece of shit
Total shit
"Unpolished - not worth the frustration even if it is free with crashing, bugs/exploits that are left unpatched, and cheaters.

EA app is also broken.  Logs out constantly, but also says youre disconnected when you are logged in and doesnt let you actually play the game you paid for. EA should be ashamed of releasing garbage like this"

"An okay game, sucks when there's campers with flamethrowers. Also fuck you Ea, Their launcher is so shit and even with a decent pc the game always crash or don't want to open certain days."
There's no way in hell this thing came after BF1. The gameplay feels and handles like shit. I really wish i could get my money back
Its shit
"no custom emblems, feels like a call of duty game and is full of cheaters (the game doesnt even need an anticheat software, all they had to do was support community servers with moderators and 3rd party plugins but i guess using the server browser was too complicated for normies) but i still wouldnt call it a bad game, and ill probably keep playing it. if youre planning to buy only one battlefield game buy bf1, otherwise buy them all, they are all dirt cheap.

also the singleplayer campaign sucks ass but who cares about the campaign in a bf game anyway

"Take Battlefield 1 and everything that makes it great...

And now, throw Battlefield 1 away.
WW2 setting, and press publish.


There are literal hundreds of people i've seen running around with very modern-looking skins, and literal holographic sights...
In this W O R L D. W A R. 2 GAME... (That is literally the time setting meant and advertised for this)
 Real EA/DICE talent everyone!

Racial slurs are exchanged like pokemon cards
People using cheats aren't even subtle about it anymore


Yeah, it's not burning garbage for a shooter game (only regular garbage)
But there SURELY is a specifific reason why this is in WW2, no?...

the ONLY redeeming thing about this is that one campaign ""The last tiger"" that seems to have had way less control from the power-drunk people at the top and given an actual glimpse at how much the devs have just been chained to their desks for the rest of the game's content"
"i paid 3.5$ for this and i wish i could get a refund  , if you play this game you have brain damage or have no idea what playing a multiplayer FPS Battlefield  game should look like"
Real Battlefield experience with bunch of retards.
so many cheaters
"Revisiting the game with more powerful hardware to enjoy its advanced effects did not age will. It uses the first gen DLSS which is quite awful. RTX makes the game hang several times, even after caching all shaders it still hangs. Dx11 remains the best way to play it, which my decade old PC could also do comfortably. I wonder if all RTX games will age similarly."
Too may cheaters. and hit detection is terrible.
horrible stealth
i will sue ur ass lil bro and u will be hearing from my lawyer ahh karen
"Ea - компания жадных пидарасов и умственно отсталых ослоебов, которые ебутся в жопу на своей работе. Другого объяснения нет  их всему похуизму на игры и нормальное предоставления услуг."
The only thing good about this game is they advocate sending women to the frontlines
The game was pretty playable until a few years ago. Now it is full of hackers and EA is doing nothing to fix it
"EA games launcher + one of the most terrible shooter

"here is where id put my battlefield 5 game timmy 


IF IT WOULDNT CRASH"
Bad game
"world of tanks- that spawn kill

going back to battlefield 1"
cheater has alot of and anti cheate like fucking dick
I reinstalled this after seeing a friend playing it but I didn't get five minutes in before remembering it was BFV before I uninstalled it
"I actually like battlefield somewhat - > good graphics, gameplay is not too shabby (alltough its going the direction of COD)

BUT why i dont recommend it?: - >

hackers

redirect scam to Origin

lags even with 7ms

political agenda in-game

damage + spawn system actually shitty"
Despite of annoying Vaginal noises and all Virtuous contravercy.. Yes this game is still a downgrade from Battlefield 1. It shows how much more impactful competent sound director is. Skip
Game is good But anti-cheating is poor. How is funny with stay stand and head shot behind the wall?
"terribly optimized, pc literally built to run bf5 can't run it without fps issues on minimum graphics settings"
Micro Transactions? Yes. EA's MicroPenis? also yes
"It crashes after 5-15 minutes and sometimes i cant even come into the start menu

Pls fix your game"
its the worst game ive ever played the maps are to big its not 3 lane and its so sweaty its basicly bo6 just that everyone snipes you and the enemies are basicly invisble untill you see a sniper scope then your dead you respawn and get spawn camped the game is awful fuck you battlefield
"You dont get Company Credits for leveling up so you cant upgrade your guns, its some sort of bug...sad for a 2018 game."
no
EA
too many cheaters in game
govno
it's shit
Shame that newer game is such a step down from the old one (BF1).
ZRBAAA
Bf4 > this
always lost connect haiya
"Jesus Christ EA....What the hell.  I know no one who matters will ever read this.  But please just try to give a damn about a modicum of historical accuracy.  I bought this on the steam sale for like $5 and I could hardly make it thru the opening.  Insufferable inaccuracies, and it looks like I play as an actual Nazi at one point?  I didn't sign up for that.  
Do yourself a favor.  Skip this game.  Punch a Nazi.  Buy a Coke."
I can't recommend it - waaaay too many blatant cheaters. It's a shame that the game has never lived up to its full potential. EA won't fix or update it; they are too busy with DEI slops nowadays.
"kernel level anti cheat for single player
Nope"
I forgot I even had this game... and hated it!
pile of hot steamy dogshit

A lot of bugs
Ca rap
"[h1] Battlefield V: EA's Masterpiece of Chaos and Regret [/h1]

Battlefield V feels less like a game and more like a social experiment to see how much frustration you can handle before uninstalling. Buckle up it’s going to be a bumpy ride.

Performance: A Battlefield Against Frame Drops
The frame drops in this game hit harder than any in-game explosion. One second you’re lining up the perfect headshot, and the next, your screen freezes just long enough for someone named “xXSniperGod420Xx” to ruin your day. And don't even get me started on the RTX-DLSS debacle. Apparently, you can’t enjoy both, because EA said so.

Graphics: Pretty, But Make It Weird
The visuals can be breathtaking until they’re not. The lighting sometimes gives you war movie vibes, but then you notice a rock texture that looks like it was borrowed from 2009. It's like the developers got tired halfway through and said, “Yeah, that’s good enough.”

Glitches That Would Make a Beta Tester Cry
Glitches are where this game truly shines. Vehicles get stuck in mid-air, players do the moonwalk after dying, and once, I saw a tank flying over a mountain like it was auditioning for Top Gun. Immersion? Absolutely shattered. Entertainment? 10/10.

Oh Boy, EA Anti-Cheat!
And now, let’s talk about EA’s pièce de résistance: the anti-cheat system. Not only does it occasionally work, but it also sneakily installs itself as a driver and starts taking screenshots of your gameplay like some sort of digital stalker. Because nothing says “fair play” like an anti-cheat system that feels more invasive than a tax audit.

EA Software: The Cherry on Top
Let’s not forget the masterpiece that is EA’s launcher and support software. It’s slow, clunky, and somehow manages to make you miss the simplicity of discs. Pair that with their anti-cheat, and you’ve got the perfect recipe for regret.

Why I Refunded It
I refunded the game right after I got sniped by a guy swimming through a wall, moments before my tank spontaneously exploded because it hit an invisible pebble. Honestly, it felt like the game was trying to refund me.

Final Thoughts
Battlefield V has its moments of brilliance buried under mountains of bugs, bad optimization, and EA’s overreach with their software. If frustration and anti-cheat drivers installing themselves uninvited sound like your thing, this might just be the game for you. Otherwise, I’d recommend saving your sanity and maybe playing Free Fire instead.

Thanks, EA, for the unforgettable experience. 💩"
so bad
cheaters
Just play Battlefield 1
i can't even play because of ea anticheat shenanigans lol nice uninstall simulator
"completely unbalanced where the defenders always win, SMG's can kill you in 1-2 shots from 70m out, and everything is so completely overexposed you cannot see a single thing but white. it is so obvious they do not give a shit about this game"
"Cinematic's jittery, runs at 30 for a 2018 AAA unbelievable, game puts motion blur back had to change it 5 times in less than 5 minutes."
does not launch keeps crashing
"This game is ****ing booboo literally every EA battlefield and battlefront game is exactly the same just reskinned  

THANK **** I GOT IT FOR $3"
"What would have been a great game. The devs and especially the music composer Johan Söderqvist did an exceptional job. One of the best soundtracks in gaming. But the people in the management had to ruin a perfect game.
Worth buying on the lowest price if you want to play the campaign. But multiplayer is a lost cause. Riddled with cheaters."
login ea app sangat mengganggu dan membuat gamenya crash karena login crash!!!!!!!!!
"Probably the worst Battlefield ever, worse than 2042. Itwalways feels like you die from their first bullet. Fuck this new DICE developers. They suck."
Step 1: Don't buy this game.
i dont like it
Full of hackers. Servers crash very often
EA
I really enjoy watching the animation like 2 times in row after i need to respawn -.- Little bit better than BF1 but still dogsh!t
DONT BUY THIS GAME SO MANY CHEATER :)
too many wall hack users
I love this game but the hacker ruin it
unfortunately 0 autobalance in the game so atleast 90% of the games one of the team i just losing big time and everyone is leaving. Also you can't report anyone for harassment resulting in an even more toxic community then cod... Not what it used to be unfortunatly
its ass
campaign was good but multiplayer was trash
Mal optimizado y el pvp no tiene balance. El BF1 es mejor.
"Loved battlefield 1 as a kid but coming into this one late I am slaughtered by level 300 planes constantly I refuse to be meat. it asked me to revise my review i will. i played this more until i died and waited out an entire game with my character stuck between dead and alive no way of reviving for 10 minutes
dog shit game fuck EA"
game is very badly optimised
"EA forces you to install its shitty launcher even after owning the game on Steam, the launcher decided to brick itself one day and the game doesn't launch anymore. Thanks EA.

Edit: Had to reinstall Windows OS to make it work again, the game works now, but the review shall still be negative."
Bought it in sale for the single player War Stories. No good if most of the times the EA launcher won't work.
"It has an Origin launcher, which prevents this game(and others on a platform) from running half of the time. To fix the problem you have to restart the PC, EVERY SINGLE TIME."
game so bad  4080 gpu  laging video realoud  fps dropping
"There is zero reason why I average 30ish kills and 10 deaths in BF1 but almost always end a match of BFV with 5ish kills and 20 deaths other than actual foul play.
This game's cheating problem is absolutely rampant. Zero moderation on """"""community"""""" servers, easy anti-cheat slapped on like a bandaid over a gaping wound, and no support from EA on the matter as this game is dead and done with.

This game is both a waste of time and money, both better spent on games like Battlefield 1."
"Every game has a cheater or hacker with aim bots and speed hacks.

Attempting to join a server will often lead to you being put in an empty lobby, or failing to join the game, or the game crashing while you're joining.

Spent more time attempting to join lobbies or being on the deploy map screen after being alive for .2 seconds than I did actually playing the game"
"Tried to play 10 matches. 4 had cheaters getting 80-0 from planes, 4 had disconnects, and 2 were actually fun. Was fun until is wasn't."
"Bad gamedesign 
Bad artdirection 
Bad gunplay"
"I want a refund, Hackers in every single game make it unplayable!!!"
fckin hackers in every game
"Feels boring compared to BF1. The maps aren't as well planned out as in BF1 so there's more running around, looking for enemies which is what I would expect when I play realistic shooters but not Battlefield. Starting to regret I bought this."
"This game is nice but there's just too many china cheaters, most of the cheaters were Chinese and they spam china websites so don't ask why am I targeting on china only, because those cheats were made from china, and also Taiwan is a country because according to the law, if a state that has its own military, currency, government will be count as a country nor a state."
"I’ve tried to like this game for a long time now, but I just can’t get over how lazy the game design feels. The gunplay doesn’t even come close to what we had before with Battlefield 1, and it’s just a bad Battlefield game overall. Sorry, I’ve tried, but I guess I’ll have to play something else."
Unplayable. Unbalanced. My eyes hurt.
not even worth the campaign for 3€..
wassnt worth 2$
"These use to have better single player story lines, now they are kinda of choppy. Its super focused on the multiplayer, they might as well only do that at this in the franchise."
worst game. game helps pros. dont buy
I came back to this BF as it was so good before. Now its just full of hackers/cheats with blatant 100/0 k/d. They sit in a plane all game hitting target every single time. another game spoilt by cheats in every server.
Hate from the west midlands
"First time entered the game, it freezes every 5 seconds. Changed the graphics to all low, still freezes every 5 seconds. Tried verified the game files, but EA Launcher wont let me in the game after that. Same problem with Need For Speed Heat. You need to verify here then restart EA launcher, etc etc then you can launch the game and pray you can play. Why cant we just use Steam, JUST STEAM to launch the game? Its unplayable and a waste of 90 gb download. I'm gonna keep it for collection though. I bought it cheap anyway."
"It s stuck, I cannot enter the single play. Keep loading and nothing happen"
Steam deck (steamOS) not supported. thanks EA.
"This game went on sale for under $10.

Aimbots are free. Let fire ants rip apart your sack if you're into self-flagellation. It'd be a better deal."
Played Battlefield 1 and loved it then decided to buy this one because I thought it was gonna be like Bf1 but this one is TRASH
HACKERS ARE PRESENT IN SOME MATCHES. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
fuking anty cheat
Getting shot in the back simulator
genuinely the worst battlefield i have ever played... just buy battlefield 1 if you want a battlefield game that's fun and isn't masochistic in game play...
thx for showing me unskippable intro cutscenes twice
"After playing this game for about a year, this is all im gonna say.

[spoiler] [h2] TOO. MANY. CHEATERS. [/h2] [/spoiler]

When i first started playing this game, there were a decent amount of cheaters. Sure, there werent any anti-cheat or lack thereof back then, and this game is the only game i can have fun on, so i have to get used to it.

When EA announced that they're gonna put EA anti-cheat on the game, i was hopeful. 2 months after the anti-cheat update, there was more cheaters before the anti-cheat update. Now i will guaranteed to encounter an instakill aimbot or redeploying cheat every day i play. At this point, i was done with the game.

[b] It was a good run while it lasts. [/b]"
"Looks worse than bf1.
Feels worse than bf1.
Plays worse than bf1.
Worst UI I have ever used.
Worst progression I have ever experienced.
Everyone is dressed like they are in Star Wars or an action movie protagonist.
Sounds better than bf1.

Dice will never make a good game again, they don't have it in them."
I'd rather buy winrar.
"same as battlefront 2 just a WW2 skin, straight garbage."
story mode bugs :thumbs_down:
"This game is so unbelievably laggy in multiplayer that I could not in good conscience suggest this to another human being. I would rather sit through a microbiology lecture for the next 5 hours and then finish off an 8 hour day with a 3 hour gender studies lecture. Do not buy this game if you enjoy multiplayer experiences, you will get none that are enjoyable."
Nerf tanks and planes
Another WW2 game zzzzzzz
"In multiplayer mode you are just joining the heavily losing side mid battle. The maps are big so everyone is just sniping from a distance, shooting from tanks from a distance. 
The single player stories are incredibly ahistorical and obviously written to suit modern politics. 
Everyone is running around with automatic guns with laser sights, weapons from any side eg japanese all running around with laser sight stgs. It doesn't respect WW2 history in the slightest. Why bother doing a WW2 game if you're not going to adhere to its history? 
I'm glad I only got this game severely discounted."
incredibly unbalanced
"Plagues with hackers, Specially in South Asian Server, even roblox anticheat  is better than whatever this has. If you are from south asia, don't even bother buying this game"
This game is straight garbage.
"The most DOG SH** PC Port I've ever seen in my life.

If you play this game on an HDR display in full screen, get ready for a seizure of a life time bro.

If you want to play with a controller, get ready for a 720 noscope kind of gameplay by just slightly moving the joystick.

If you own an AMD gpu, good luck. That's all I can say brother."
....
"Team stacking seems to be a much larger problem than in BF 1 or BF 2042. Every second game gets ruined by this.

Sliding makes this game feel kinda clownish, but wcyd. The movement in general is much worse than in BF 1.

Using planes vs ground targets doesn't require any skill (due to rockets, and the fact that fighter guns do splash damage). Furthermore the existence of rockets, fighter planes can even heads-on kill an AA gun, they simply just out-damage it from the far. This means no skill or situational awareness is required from the pilot. Farming ground targets is therefore embarissingly easy and does not add any value to the game."
"My whole playertime was spent on logging in and out of the game trying to prevent the game from breaking my whole audio output, took me extra hour or two to change half the window audio settings,troubleshooting. Game just decides to shit itself by going mute then breaking whole audio on entire PC unless you shut off the game. Turns out its not an unique experience when i read dozens of forums of people having the same exact issue, EA is ran by money driven troglodytes. Sadly unfixable problem for many"
shit game
Too many cheater.
EA bad
BF1 > BF5
The online mode is way too sweaty and there's no storyline.
"The graphics of this game are beautiful, really well done and immersive.

That about sums up the good portions of the game.  I really REALLY wanted to like it.  My first foray into WWII shooters were MoH, Spearhead and CoD2.  This is not those games.

Every bullet flies like you're using a paintball gun.  Horrible physics, you'll be point blank aiming at the chest of an enemy standing in front of you and the bullet goes through them like they aren't there.

I have zero desire to compete against other people.  I don't need to achieve victory over others to make myself feel better about my own life.  Why is there no bot support for anything except practice range and missions?  Missed opportunity.

For the $3.49 I paid, I still feel overcharged."
corporate slop; doesnt even come close to bf1.
The game won't even start. F**k EA
shit
"a lot of hacker , why don't want to add AI mode in 64 match ? mission only can play 4 player , also is not fair 20 vs 4 ?"
eh
"I really enjoyed this game for many years on many different consoles and PC, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! not for $60 not for $50, $30, $20, $10, hell don't even download it if they make it free I have played the past 3 nights in a row and every single server i was in got ddos by hackers and crashed. this game is unplayable."
"can't believe i bought this trash, all EA games are trash.
Give me back my money, boycott EA. They only know how to take your money"
"bf5 felt like a worse bf1. i consider bf1 as the golden standard, and this game fails to even be in the same league as that game. Operators, elites, skins... on the multiplayer front this game is less a war game and more a call of duty arcade-ish game. compared to bf1, where soldiers feel like actual soldiers with a story and a life, these guys feel like eternally respawning characters with little to no personality.

The singleplayer campaigns are ass (yet again, compared to bf1), the story is less consistent and certain elements have no right to exist (actual example: in the Tirailleur campaign, the mc's friend ""sacrifices"" himself by blocking the hatch to a tank after throwing a grenade inside in order to not let the guys inside escape, yet a few seconds earlier, he shoots a guy who was trying to peek out of the tank. Why couldn't he do the same again? Why is the mc suddenly fine after having to be dragged seconds earlier? Also, the whole reason for the campaign is because the mc turns war into a fight against racism. Maybe the guys in ww2 actually did that, but i feel that this is completely unnecessary and should not exist).

Overall, this game is good, but not nearly as good as it should've been. 6/10, would probably play for another 40-50 hours before uninstalling to get enough space for baldur's gate 3."
"Made by mentally ill people taking more offense to symbols than the horrors of war

Also gameplay is ass if you don't go to hardcore servers

Only buy if -90% off"
hackers ahh game
"It's a good game, but much better on console. On the PC version there is too many controls to press and aiming is near impossible (might be because I have nerve damage in my right hand, but I do much better in other shooters). The guns suck ass though, a bolt action rifle takes 2 shots? By the time the you shoot the second shot off, you have been mowed down by someone with an MG or SMG. It's much better in battlefield 1 as it's practically 1 shot, 1 kill for the snipers rifle."
STUP1D A33 GAME MESSED UP MY HDR SETTINGS CANT EVEN FIX THIS SH1T EA GO SUCK A B1G C0CK U BUNCH OF L0SERS WHAT ARE YALL DOING ALL DAY JUST MESSING UP OUR SETTINGS GO EAT YOUR DUMB A33 GAME C0CK SUCKERS
Why does this have so many non-skipable cut scenes? The story is stupid just let us play the game.
This game is a sweatfest. Some guy with 5000 hrs will get in a tank or plane and cheese his way to 75 kills.
"The game is ok, but the fucking EA app is extremally shit"
"EAC trojan horse in the kernel. mark my words its a huge security risk, someone will figure out how to use eac kernel level to gain administrative rights to yours system."
Very sweaty when i am just trying to relax
ALDRI MER DRIT KJEDELIG
"To be honest i really liked the idea of battle field in general. But for me battlefield 1942 was where is stopped playing. I wasn't expecting super realism or much historical accuracy. I'm a fan of having rare weapons such as prototype weapons and weapons that didn't see much use on the front but were at least made in that period that adds a sort of diversity. The game focuses on semi-automatic and full automatic weaponry, but in a match i saw 2 to 3 bolt action rifles and the rest were assault rifles. on top of that the weapons themselves have no faction limits apparently the British forces can all be equipped with mp 40 smgs as if they were standard issue. The character customization was another downside for me, the ""cosmetics"" were unrecognizable to as i know the clothing item by name and camo type. no camouflage names no real uniforms used by the German army and they had a random name like the ""aristocrat"".  They had to push political agendas with adding female characters, all i heard on the battlefield TM were women screaming it felt like i was in a bloody maternity clinic. Some of the characters look like they came from the madmax universe. Helmets have no name like M35 Stahlhelm or M1 helmet. Some of the British camo patterns were not even real. there is a skin with a woman wearing a gas-mask from the cold war! It feels like it takes a whole mag to kill an opponent. Vehicle wise its pretty OK.
The Graphics are nice, for example the mountains in the fjell map. I am all for adding a few maps that haven't been covered in history or maps where battles didn't happen but just make the game labeled as alt history. I didn't like the way they put this game together i give it an overall 3/10"
"This game is not like I thought, high pc requirements, i does not run smoothly, bf1 is much better."
Funny how Battlefield 1 is what bfV wanted to be lol
"After the last time I played this game, quite a bit of time passed. I went from Xbox to PC and have been wanting to get this game again for all this time. The game is beautiful. Mechanics are great as always. However, there is one thing that absolutely ruins the game for me and that thing is the abundance of hackers; I spent most of my time setting up my classes and vehicles, only to go into a public match right afterwards. I am not exaggerating when I say this match was getting bent over and f--ked from behind. Hackers in the enemy team, killing everyone from places that you would never hit in vanilla BFV. It instantly turned me off from the game and I have already submitted a refund request."
"I haven't played BF since BF"", so after all these years and the sale on, I thought I would give it a go. I cannot believe that I finally bought BFV and found it to be the most frustrating POS I've played. 

Start the game, and you are treated to a loooooong  interactive introduction. You fight for a bit, then you die. Then it loads you somewhere else, you fight and die, then it loads you somewhere else, rinse repeat. after the 5th time, I just switched my TV off, and had a cup of tea. Sometime later I turn my TV back on, and the intro seems to have finally finished. I don't know how long the intro should be, but I reckon 30 mins should be enough for it to fully finish.

I finally get into a multiplayer conquest game. Took a few mins to start. Then after 90 seconds of battle time, the screen faded to black to inform me that someone else is joining our squad. In the middle of a firefight.

Put simply, The game states that I have currently 1.1 hours of play time. In reality, its been little over 2 minutes of actual gameplay.

EDIT: I tried the solo, and the solo missions are extremely linear. Too much cinema, hardly any gameplay. May as well be point-&-click. I closed the game as soon as I was arbitrarily blown up for the story.

In Summary, this is probably the most redundant review for the game, because I struggled to even get to the ""play"" part of the game.

I won't be wasting my time with this again, a few euros down the toilet as a lesson and promptly uninstalled.

I'll see what CoD is like.

Just. Let. Us. Play."
"Straight up cant play this game, and now BF1 because the the anti-cheat wont work without maybe wiping my OS and starting with a new one JUST TO CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH HACKERS STILL! Wont be buying bf 2042 till this is fixed by EA because it isn't worth my time to redo my PC`s OS just because 2 or 3 games don't work. Lol ill just play BattleBit or halo then. Dont get me wont i LOVE both these games but now i just cant play them. Why buy the new one if i dont know if it`ll suffer the same issue"
meh
"waited a few hours waiting for it to download, got through the intro only for it to crash"
"Sorry, but I'm struggling to see why anyone likes this game and generally hate BF2042. BF2042 is graphically and mechanically better, and not as dead. 

In terms of WW2 shooters, this pales in comparison to HLL. But I wanted something more casual. Sadly I was disappointed. It hasn't aged anywhere near as well as people say."
"This is seriously one of the worst games I've ever played. To whoever said this is ""good now"", it isn't.

Stop telling EA you want the next battlefield to be more like this. BF4 or BF1 are much better this. This game is not worth even the 3.50 it goes for on sale. Pick up Battlefield 1 for 2 dollars and have a much better experience."
this game is unplayable on non-hardcore servers
SHIT CHEATER GAME
leeeeee
"Ive been playing BF campaigns in order, and this one is by far the least optimized. The short story is just ""good guy kill nazi WITH explosions!"" I cant recommend this game unless its on 90% sale"
"this game has been out for so long yet the campaign is still slightly buggy and choppy cutscenes, campaign story and gameplay was meh... lotsa stealth mission like as it was discounted Metal Gear Solid.

Such a fall from grace from BF1 masterpiece, everything that BF1 was is definitely not here"
"Everyone's a sweat which ruin's the fun of the game, doesn't matter how good your internet is because you will always have issues like inability to reload, swap guns, MOVE, frame drops etc

The people that play this game truly bring the meaning of ""Hell on earth"" into full effect in the worse way possible as you WILL NOT have fun playing this game with them

Avoid at all cost"
"Probably one of the best looking WW2 games ive ever seen, but thats about all it has going for it. Loadouts are pretty unbalanced with 2/3 of the arsenal being useless (Weapon balancing it dreaful). The servers seem okay. Ping isn't as much of an issue as it once was. Sadly Cheaters have taken over the game with zero reprocussion. Reports go unchecked and they run rampant on Conq/TDM. 

*You Can Paint A Turd But It's Still A Turd*"
Had to buy the game on this account because EA took the game off my main and told me they can't reinstate it because it's a bug.... 3/10
The biggest Bruhh... full of Asian hacking kids.. EA and Dice wtf are you doing??
"Nice graphics but shit mechanics and progression for weapons!!!
All predecessors are better!"
"LOT OF CHEATER, EA DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR THAT."
"This is probably the worst modern gaming experience, it is the most inaccurate representation of WW2, it should be called shot in the Backfield 5. Garbage game do not but this dont even get the EA pass to play this shitty game. Worst 11 hours of my life fuck this game fuck EA fuck Dice and fuck all the sweaty bitches that play this garbage fucking game too. Terrible -10/10. Dont do it, dont play this game."
"Battlefield - ❌❌❌

Cheat-Field - ✅✅✅"
"What a pos of a BF game in 2024.

- meta is lame af
- massive vehicle spam in matches
- cheaters everywhere, BF1 was cheater free compared to this 
- most lobbies terribly imbalanced, hardly ever making for a good game
- toxic idiotic player base (the rotten left-overs of the former player base)

I thouroughly started to hate the game after a short while.

₣𝔘ℂ𝝟 𝙀Ầ !!"
"Worst game ever its rage game no tanks just literly spawn kill or be killed. 

ENLISTED better"
It's have more bugs with saves
probably the worst battlefield experience you could ask for. PC gameplay is horrible compared to console. can we all do a the gaming community a favor and just let this game franchise die like the neglected dog it is.
Recently EA have added kernel anti-cheat which intentionally blocks anyone on Linux playing so i can't recommend
"Can't even open the game.

Look, If you're going to sell a bad game for an absurd price at least let me play it. I have tried everything but EA hasn't done jack shit so far and doesn't want to offer any kind of assistance."
"to many cheaters, lads on 3-4 lvl going 54/7... sniping u across the another end of the map."
"Low population. Stacked Teams (No Moderators/Admins/Community Servers).

No hardcore mode.

All weapons unlocked, doesn't make sense to see G.I's with MP40's and Japanese soldiers with Thompsons. No historical accuracy at all.

Female soldiers everywhere, black germans? Wheres the toggle to turn the game into an actual WW2 game? Oh yea. Its not one."
"Bring back BF3 and BF4!! I dont want to play anymore ""old"" war games anymore"
Just NAH
plane play sucks dick
"Not fun. Maps are designed terribly. Movement is a little too arcade-y even for bf games. Seeing guy crouch run and slide with big lmg is dumb. No more classic spotting. Its pings, doesn’t feel right. Don’t recommend this game.
Bf1 is much better and more immersive. Bf1 is more fun. Bf4 is also fun and better than this"
No chance finding a game now. Don't waste your money.
"Not enough tanks
I dont die to tanks enough. All of the pacific theater maps need more tanks. I dont like the tanks currently because theyre not overpowered enough. They dont shoot through bunkers hard enough and their armor against literally every explosive is wayy to weak
Buff tanks"
"Battlefield V features engaging combat and impressive visuals, but is hindered by limited server availability and an unbalanced time-to-kill in standard game modes. These issues can make gameplay frustrating, especially for newcomers or those seeking a more consistent and fair experience in multiplayer matches."
why do i have to install anti cheat if im just gonna play the campaign?
EA continues to get worse. If not newest no support so therefore hacker paradise. Maps are awful. Bullet physics don't existent. 2/10 at best
This game has disgusting micro stuttering even on i9 14900K paired with RTX 4090
wont run on linux
Not fun
"couldn't skip the intro and ""tutorial"""
Game is not launching
"Don't buy this game, this is the last time I'm falling for this S#!% EA, if it was just the horrible balance of weapons, or the In-stent spawn kills (you can't spawn next to your squad member during a fight, but don't worry, will send you right next to 3 enemies soldier GL)  i wouldn't even be writing this review at all, but the consent ping falls (it over 9000) and the hackers have put the last nail in the coffin.
I wouldn't recommend buying there games with a discount   -.- (i would ask for a refund if i could) -.-
at this point its feels like EA is just trolling 

I all most never right reviews, but i couldn't stop myself this time... i really don't understand how they are ""mostly positive"""
inhuman  ct
Recoil is ridiculous and the players are always sweaty. Also WOKE NONSENSE.
"boring, bad shooting system."
"Hard no.

It may have been good when it came out (idk?), but every match is determined by people looking to grief the match.

You think you are playing a competitive game, but your participation means nothing. Your kd means nothing. It is all about who takes the tanks in to points, or out of them... and that happens ""in reverse"" due to malacious intent every single gd match.

Do not waste your money or time on this game. Nor bf1. This series is gone."
waste of money and freaking time full of hackers and hackers an only hackers niggas be killing you from 400 meters with a pistol
EA app is shit
This games blows
dont buy it u get ban for no reason to ea louncher and all your games BANED.
This game had the potential to be a really good game but in classic EA fashion they pre maturely killed the game
"I played for 10 hours, and spent another 12 hours trying to connect to online servers. 
EA Games = Clowns. RIP"
"dont buy this game , the game just wont launch , try fix but cant play this shit"
"Battlefield V, what a disaster this was from trailer, to release, to current day. This game is no longer supported by EA/DICE nor will they likely be touching this game (Since BF2042 exists), so this is a ""What you see, what you get"" situation now. This game was released in 2018, mainly a successor to Battlefield 1 (released in 2016). However Battlefield V did a lot of things different from Battlefield 1 that made me not enjoy it as much as BF1, a lot of changes were rather questionable too.

Positives:
Lots of unique weapons (69 counted, including some from BF1)
Customization for Soldiers, Vehicles, and Aircraft
Amazing final Warstory
Good visuals and effects
Crouch-sprinting
Squad-revive system
Fortification system
Reinforcement system

Negatives:
Specialization system
Poor multiplayer map design. (Some maps allowing spawn kills while others are way too open.)
COD-Like Sliding (even though sliding was in Battlefield 1, BFV's sliding feels more closely to COD sliding than what it was in BF1)
Spotting replaced with squad-based pinging.
Reviving is no longer gadget based but animation based. (No syringe gadget)
Weird gun control. (some guns feel less accurate when ADSing and so on)
Ghillie Suit cosmetics or comsetics that make it difficult to ID targets at times.
No accessbility option to disable or have player cosmetics mirror your own.
Below-Average warstories (All of them have at least one stealth section or more too)
Terrible stealth in Warstories (Downgrade from BF1's stealth)
HP has a ""fixed"" state so you can't repair/heal to full HP at times unless you have bandages (on-foot) or resupply at a marked resupply depot (vehicle)
Elite Kits are non-existant
No custom emblems
No suppression despite being given points for it at times (Suppression was removed from what users say)
A Lack of a Codex (Battlefield 1 had a Codex which taught history about the weapons, world, and of the 1st World War itself)
Minimum DogTag customization/options
No Behemoths (Likely a result of the Reinforcement system)
Only 4 playable factions (compared to BF1's 10 playable factions)
No end-of-game map voting. (Meaning each map is played in order and they aren't scrambled)

As a result I just couldn't like the game. In the end this game feels like it plays more like COD than a Battlefield game which meant my experience wasn't that pleasant. My recommendation is to buy it on sale if you want to give it a try. For me however, this game is below-average and I can not really recommend it in the end."
game macam babi buk banyak
Bring back Steam Deck support!
Save your money
"Wont run, EA ruines everything they touch. AntiCheat is causing issues on my PC and after 3hours of basic troubleshooting nothing helpes> Please dont bother buying any EA game. If i have to pay for a product i demand it runs instantly"
hackers hackers and hackers :(
"Save your money and your time, this just ain't worth it. Go play BF4/BF3"
"Terrible progression system with little to no depth. 
Most people have fully kitted guns with enhanced fire rate traits making everything you use feel useless? To get said traits you need daily/ weekly currency.....wtf is this mobile game design?

Additionally flat maps with no cover are awful to play on? The game doesn't give you enough tools to deal with vehicle and sniper dominated maps. It just makes a complete mess of a game design wise? The only positive is the setting...and even then that's highly inaccurate. 

Save your money and your time, this just ain't worth it. Go play BF4/BF3. Glad I picked this up dirt cheap and not full price."
"Forcing you to linear play, minimum options for improvization and buggy.  Headshooted flamethrower guy 5 times and nothing until you come near and activate his script."
"MP maps way too small, gives me claustrophobia."
Its just bf1 but worse. But hey man the pacific maps are fun.
"This game is literally held together with tape. Invisible walls everywhere. Try to shoot someone you hit a wall thats not there!!!!!!!@!!!!!!! Ai enemies not taking damage in story. The Ai cheat hard in this pile of trash. cant skip videos WTF this game is a pile of trash!!!
The story mode is not fun at all less you like sneaking around might as well play splinter cell."
Keeps crashing after countless attempts of fixing it and every time I open this game it shows me first time intro screen the story and the whole bunch of sheet
"TOO MANY CHEATERS, 
THESE ARE TYPE OF CHEAT THEY WERE USING:
- THE FLASH, RUN SO FAST, ALMOST DO TELEPORTATION
- AIM BOT"
Shitty game. I just started playing and I have to fight lvl 500 players campering every corner and cheating.
"Game was pretty bad at launch. After years of ignoring it, I jumped back in. It is somehow worse. Less BF more COD fag. 

Might only be $10 but save the money and stuff it deep inside your pee hole, its still a better use of your money than this garbage."
would be fine cheaters are insane
bad
One of the worst multiplayer games I have ever played.
"Garbage, no wonder this franchise is dying
Play bf4/3 instead"
What I can do is only sightseeing
New anti-cheat is trash.
horrible game
"New EA Anticheat broke the support for Linux and therefore for Steamdeck as well. No big surprise that EA does not care about customers, but it's a shame that a game that worked perfectly well for several years under Proton is no longer playable."
"I cannot recommend a game that crashes on startup no matter what I do to try and fix it. If you're at all interested in the game, be warned that you may not be able to even play it. EA ought to be crucified for this.

UPDATE: Frosty Mod Manager trips up EA Anti Cheat and stops the game from launching, this happens for all EA games with an anti-cheat even if you're only using Frosty for one game. If you're having similar problems you can find a fix online. EA should still be crucified for adding their awful anti-cheat."
"Probably the worst Battlefield ever.

Tries a lot of stuff and fails so miserably that all the features that came from older titles and were changed (spotting, gun loadouts...) were reverted by the next entry.

If you are a veteran (at least since Bad Company) you will have to relearn the whole game, the minimap Is almost useless, noone uses the context spotting cause it's pointless, clutters your vision and it just sucks, so you have to use your eyes and ears, which sounds amazing until you realize that the maps barely have effective cover, so it's basically getting lucky and catching the enemy by surprise (or them catching you by surprise cause you have no effective intel)

With that said, the game can be fun in TDM (sometimes, if you don't get a cheater, which there are a lot of) cause spotting doesn't matter that much in such closed spaces, depends on the map though.

Fuck context spotting, fuck specializations and personally, fuck the game entirely honestly. Only worth a buy if under 10€ and to play a couple hours max if you get good maps."
"Waste of Money and a Trash Game, OG BF1 players would be devastated .EA shame on you."
cant even play this game without cheater in a match. wasted their money on their anticheat
Poor Performance. Moving on to Delta Force
"I’ll tell you right off the bat—I don’t get why people like this game. It’s just so frustrating.

First off, the “downed state” you’re forced into every time you’re killed is incredibly annoying, and I can’t believe they even carried it into Battlefield 2042. It completely breaks the flow of gameplay.

Then there’s the weapon selection. Unlike Battlefield 1, where every gun felt impactful, Battlefield V’s starting weapons are weak and uninspiring. It feels like you have to use the meta loadouts just to have a fighting chance; otherwise, you’re outgunned in almost every scenario.

The map design only makes things worse. So many maps have wide open areas where you’re an easy target for tanks, snipers, or mounted MGs. On one map, the B flag is practically in full view of the enemy spawn, with only a small, broken house as cover. It’s a frustrating design choice that leads to endless, annoying deaths.

The one thing I do like is the addition of ammo and medic caches you can build on the map. This cuts down on the reliance on Support players for ammo, which is a nice touch. But even this feature can’t save the game from its other issues.

Team composition and the weapons assigned to Medics are also frustrating. Medics have short TTK weapons, so they often ignore revives to focus on combat instead. This means you’re left lying in that awful downed state for way too long.

All in all, I can’t recommend Battlefield V. The game is full of annoying mechanics and design flaws that make it feel like a step backward. If you want a real Battlefield experience, I’d suggest going back to Battlefield 1 or Battlefield 4 instead."
"I love this game, it has been my go to for many years, I have played it for hundreds of hours on origin. I wish I didn't have to write this review but it pains me to know I won't be able to play this game without EA's malware (kernel level anti-cheat) running deep within my system. Removing Linux support was a horrible decision and one I can't stand by."
get you shit together EA and fix the goddamn battlefield 1 anti cheat bs this is hot garbage compared to 1
This game is a goddamn joke
"This pile of EA sh*t is another example of why pirating a game is going to become mainstream. I can't start the game because the game doesn't want to start. Why? Due to it's stupid anti cheat. Well you might think: that's cause you're a cheater. Thing is, how can I be a cheater if i have not played the game at all so far? Also, how can i be a cheater if i have nothing open in the background. It's simple. I have Rectify 11 installed and Nilesoft Shell to make my Windows 11 more bearable. But you might think, how does this matter for this game... Well, this game's anti cheat thinks that Nilesoft Shell is a hack, and that i try to cheat in this game, and won't even let me play single player. If you want to avoid at least a day of troubleshooting why the damn game won't even start, buy this. If not, pirate it, do the single player and move on... To me, no more EA games anymore. It's clear they don't want me as a customer, even if i only want to play single player (for now, or why would i even try it's multiplayer if it won't let me launch).

PS, if you're wondering where i got the 2h of gameplay, it's from before it's last update which completely broke it for me. I played 2h in the first mission back then, called it a day, and now i returned to the game after a few months. In the meantime they updated it with a broken anti cheat, for a game that doesn't even have that much of a multiplayer scene anyway."
"DAWG WATER GAME, POOR GUN PLAY, NO SERVERS, HIGH PING, CHEATERS? DO NOT BUY EVEN FOR $7.50 ITS TRASH"
they where NOT cooking
didint work
unrealistic stories that i didn't expected for a game that describes ww2
boo
"Found it very boring, coming from BFBC2 this is a certain downgrade in fun and implementation."
"Absolutely God awful, stay away from that trash"
This game was fun BUT get boring so quickly
"Cheaters Fest.
the only reason I bought this trash was I heard there's gonna be an anti cheat. 
and there is. but EA anti cheat is as helpful as a broken condom. 
I encounter cheaters every match. EVERY FUCKING MATCH. no matter what time of the day you're playing a cheater will ruin ur day. 
last night I had this guy who one shot u in the leg with any weapon and he used his Teleport ability to get away. 
this morning I thought this is gonna be good time to play cuz cheaters are probably asleep. but I just saw another dude who could hedshot u from miles away with a lewis gun. he had 80 kills and 0 death. the best guy in our team had 19 kills!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if u think there's no cheater you're most likely too naive to spot em or you're the type who camps in a tank or a plane the whole match that's why cheaters don't affect u. 
and reporting them doesn't do anything. my whole team report a cheater but he's still in the match. Dice doesn't ban anyone. cuz as I said it's a broken condom. 
Fuck Dice. Fuck Condoms"
ARABIC
"EA play always runs into issues when trying to launch this game. why do i need to have 2 different clients login to access one game, absolutely stupid"
Wasted 10$ for it NOT TO EVEN RUN AT 40 FPS WHILE HAVING A 4060 TI AND A 12400F LIKE WHAT THE FCK... NOT TO MENTION ALL THE OTHER BUGS
"I have more hours and origin and bought it on steam to play it on Linux.

I can’t play anymore because of the integration of the new anti cheat.

The game was working perfectly fine before. 
As a consumer, I feel deeply disrespected"
Doesn’t work on Steam Deck.
"i love battlefield but the amount of lite cheaters is insane, to give you an example there are aimbot programs that also give you the option to tell you if someone is aiming at you  i only play on hardcore servers and see for your self if you hide somewhere with a sniper and aim in the general direction of other snipers a lot of them suddenly move away even when no one else  is shooting at them"
"So many problems. One of the biggest is the insane amount of cheaters still in the game, even after the ""anticheat"". Wouldn't recommend unless you hate enjoying life"
MY CHARACTER IS A GIRL??!?!?!? WHAAAT INNACCURATE!! THERE WAS BASICALLY NO GIRLS DYING ON THE BATTLEFRONT. woke shet EA
"EA decided to fix cheaters on windows by breaking game on linux. Welp, there already tons of reasons to pirate EA games, you just added another game to that list."
"I have underestimated EA.
Anti - launching the game - cheat and crap
Because fuck you that's why

DO NOT EVER BUY EA GAME. Do not help the enemy."
"It's Battlefield, I'd rather slam my dick in a car door than ever touch this piece of shit ever again in my life, I would rather marry the love of my life, have 2 beautiful children with her, watch her die of a terminal illness, and be raising them alone as a single father, never wanting to fall in love again mourning the great loss I suffered. I would rather stub my pinky toe 100x over than ever even glance as this POS game. Completely ass, would never recommend, would rather play literally anything else. Also gotta install the EA dogshit software just to play a piece of dogshit. 

PS I fucking HATE Battlefield.
PSS i tried playing again drunk, still ass, how can a game be bad when drunk?"
This game is perfectly playable on Linux -- or it would be if EA didn't blanket ban all Linux players. Steam also refuses to issue a refund even though the product was literally taken away from me on a whim.
"i hate the number ""v"""
"A lot of bugs while playing the campaign, the multiplayer is unbalanced, game is not optimized at all, hackers are everywhere."
bad
"Unless you've got an opportunity to buy at a great discount, I wouldn't recommend. There aren't many hardcore servers running, and if you're in NA most of the community servers have poor ping. There are definitely hackers running about at light speed occasionally.

While they definitely did improve by adding the Pacific maps, the stupid decisions that the devs made are still present. EA and DICE are bad companies that you shouldn't support. Spend your money on better games like Hell Let Loose and stop giving these clowns money.

I got it for like $3 and wouldn't put more than that into it."
"It is as feared.

US uniforms in 1940

Women soldiers

The SBS being referred to as criminals 

Basic controls 


Don't even buy this on deal!"
"It was quite the satisfaction to delete this obnoxious thing called Battlefield V from my PC. 
I would rather play Mario Kart than this ****."
"Mmmm.  I played the first mission and the last one.  Unskippable mid and after-action cutscenes sure make this game drag on.  I alt-tabbed over to type this review because I'm not interested in being forced to watch the cinematic feels for the Nazi tank commander and his crew.  Aircraft are a joke in this game; both flying them and shooting at them.  They fly with the the grace and speed of pigeons when you're shooting them, have magical tracking abilities if they're shooting at you, and do some stupid rubber-banding when you're flying one.  Fly away from your target for thirty seconds, patiently gaining altitude and distance, then turn back and you've got a good 3 seconds to lineupyourtargetOMGthereitISSHOOT-NO-TIME-PULL-UP!  Would not recommend.  I can't imagine paying the full retail on this game."
fix the game launcher for heavens sake EA
"One of the best battlefield games out there (BF1 was trash).

That being said, I mostly played this on console when it first came out. Bought this again on pc and the majority of the servers were dead. The ones that weren't or had any sort of population was fine at first, but as soon as there's a distinct losing team they turn on their mods/hacks and don't lose more than 5 tickets while yours get absolutely drained. Not worth playing anymore 2024 onward. This game has zero anticheat, you're not going to have fun."
Do not buy any EA games. Hackers Paradise and they do not care.
гавно❗ не дали мастерство на разведчика
BF 1 better
"Oh yeah please make LMGs more unfun to use i am sure everyone loves it...

Witnessing battlefield to evolve backwards."
"Garbage. Worst of the battlefield games so far. Aiming in this game is terrible,  and the settings are ridiculous and over complicated in the options. Stories are a joke, that's not a campaign."
"Vittu mitä paskaa, enemmän codi kun bäfä. Kannattaa ostaa BF 1 mielummin vaikka tonnilla kun tämä 3 eurolla, saatte enemmän vastinetta rahoille.

In English:
Paska peli"
Feels More Call Of Duty Than Battlefield...
Insane lags when any other game runs smoothly. Shame..
Парашка
when the competition is making newer anti cheat that doesn't work while worsening the game and my opponent is EA
"Playing this game it's more like I'm disrespecting the history of the war. Too much of cosmetics in WW2....game.....
It's like bunch of ""clowns"" running around the war instead of real soldiers....

Welp, I'm just gonna stick to BF1 instead"
fucking campfest
definitive edition give me the fucking special class mastery assignment!
First they take your money and then block you from playing because you're not using the right OS.
"Don't touch it. Play Battlefield 1 instead. It has better graphics, gameplay, controls, audio, feeling, customization, etc. Just please don't buy this."
"I purchased the game because I loved the old BF1942. Though the graphics are much more stunning in this, the constant having to unlock weapons is annoying. Why can't everyone just get the same weapons out of the box? 
Lastly, I game on Linux, and now with the Kernel level anti-cheat, I can't even play the game in single player mode. I mean, if it's single player, why do I need anti-cheat? A thumbs down to EA for shitting on a game I liked."
"Worked fine on Steam Deck for years, now they suddenly added kernel level spyware, making even singleplayer impossible to play on Steam Deck, Linux or inside VMs.

You still have more people cheating in multiplayer than ever before, as there are multiple known workarounds to create a new account without paying again. Yet actually legit players are no longer allowed to start the game.

Zero logic, pure actionism, typical EA move. Just stay away from anything this company is involved in."
"Revised Review: When this game went on sale for $7.49, I decided I might try the game out. Well, after playing for a while, I started to enjoy the game a little bit more, the campaigns are a bit more open world then previous entries, although not to the same quality. Multiplayer is alright, although if you live in the US, you're basically fucked, the only consistent US servers are run by a discord group and practically almost always have a waiting queue of a couple players. I don't think it's as awful as I did before, but I still don't recommend this game.
Original Review: When I saw this game on sale for $7.49 I figured that even if I didn't play it for too long I would still get my money's worth. And after trying a bit of everything I have to admit I have not gotten that money's worth. The single-player story was meh at best, and the online multiplayer was not as enjoyable as previous entries. If you want something akin to this game I would highly recommend Battlefield 1 instead."
"After 5 years, EA still doesn’t give a f to that imbecilic reloading saved gameplay issue. Before buying this, keep in mind that although you’ve played the game for a couple of hours, as soon as you quit the game and restart it, your settings will be default again and you need to run through all the opening plots again. Great job EA, such a POS"
Trash
Game is good but EA is useless
"I played this game for a while, but then I stopped for a year because my PC couldn’t run it. Now that I’ve upgraded, I decided to come back and play, only to find out I was banned for no reason. 

4/10 it was fun tho."
"they banned me in this game i dont like it why they banned me i play all the games 
unbanned me Battlefield V"
"completamente bugado, prefiro ffazer uma lobotomia, precisei usar programinha pra liberar conquistas bugadas, terrivel experiencia."
cheaters
Doesnt work on linux anymore. Is winows paying yall off or are you just too lazy to check a box on battleye software?
"i really loved this game… all Battlefield games are awesome the only downside whit all of them is EA and DICE trying to squeeze every single penny out of their community and somehow they are not even trying to please the community.

cool und fun for casual gaming on playstation or pc but every other port has major problems or the support just got cut of like on the steamdeck… thats sad i bought it just for my steamdeck cuz i really liked it on ps4 

sad but true i will never buy anything from EA or DICE… so many years of “oh com on EA is not that bad” are over"
played this game back on xbox and it was great. got it again for PC and I couldn't even launch the game. I tried asking support but no one would help me. if you can get the game to run then I'd recommend it but im not paying any amount of money for a game that doesn't work on my system.
"another trash game. trash movement, trash tanks, trash server quality. if you are a movement player, like warzone or bo6, never try it. I regret the one hour of my life I put into trying this out."
Shuttering and clunky
"Went to play the game after months of inactivity, found that EA intentionally broke Linux support. Won't be buying online games from these scam artists again, I have enough unplayable garbage now thanks."
"Lost all my stats when I loaded the game on steam, Forced me to play 2042. It's a sad point in time for battlefield!"
it is mid
Adolf Rizzler is not in the game as promised
ea + crashes on launch
"i dont know but the server is pretty awful for company this big, especialy in asia server

and encountering few chineese that is toxic on voice chat"
"Either servers are empty are they are way across the world the US server empty
If you want to play the Campaign for but MP you won't get that experience it seems"
It just wont start
"Something went wrong!

The EA app encountered an error and couldn't finish installing (error code: INST-3-1920)


FUCK THIS AND FUCK YOU."
BF 1 is so much better and has better gameplay and graphics even though it came years before this.Also this game on PC in infested with cheaters and EA went from useless Dice anticheat to another useless EA anticheat as people still are cheating in a major way.Instead of making a proper anticheat system they spend time developing garbage like 2042.Next BF will probably suck as well and will have the same cheating issues like previous ones.If you really want to play this game then I suggest do it on console as cheatiing is not noticable there so much.
"Sadly can't give a positive review considering I barley put an hour on this and the single player cut scenes run at like 4fps and every 20 minutes the game shuts off my pc. I got a brand new pc with a i9, a 4090, and 64gb of ram. The fact this game is doing this makes it absolute garbage."
cant launch the game
No realism. Downgrade from BF1
"Game told me i was banned the moment i booted it up, no way of taking that ban out, wasted money."
"rather un-fun, no rhyme or reason as to weapon damage, everything feels rng"
"The game stopped working on Linux.
Can't refund it, but won't recommend it to anyone due to the blatant disregard for their customer's experience on the side of EA.

It is not ok to break game compatibility on a whim."
"dude battlefield 1 came years before and is so m,much better still like lmaoooooo"
NO
constantly crash after playing for 30-45 minutes.

"hey! i got an idea! lets make a video game about a group of super tough muslim and black women who led a secret special forces group that was like totally responsible for putting an end to napoleon's reign of terror!!! that happened!!!!! right ...????

ok, how about an all super far left feminist movement chicks who totally aren't butch ... maybe... but totally kick butt and they show up to save george washington's butt in the revolutionary war with a bunch of freed african slaves who were actually nigerian special forces before they were captured by white guys in khaki shorts and carrying elephant guns and horribly enslaved ""back in da day! yo ...."" that help like totally defeat the french! i mean british ... wait, was it the british or the french we were fighting? or both ...??? hmmm ... like, im totally getting a headache yo ... 

ok, ok, how about this ... a bunch of super tough, but totally not butch chicks free a school of down syndrome children from the nazi's and show them their true potential! they build a time machine, and we go into past, and we meet up with a bunch of minority and/or effeminate men who like totally worship us and the down syndrome kids like totally kill hitler before he takes power and stops ww2 and totally saves the world! and like, totally put a native american in it too!!!! a female native american! who teams up with an angry tomboyish 15 year old, who totally isn't butch! maybe ... and they like totally rebel against her overbearing dad, who turns out to be an awful bad guy she has to get rid of and replace with her girl power while all the sissy guys cheer me on! yay! girl power! right ...??? 

ok, ok, how about this ... a super tough muslim chick leads an insurgency where tons of muslim dudes obey her every command, like, you know, that's totally believable right??? oh wait, COD already did that with one of their crap shows??? darn ....

ok, ok, how about we do one where we show how it was actually overwhelming numbers of black men in the northern army that won the civil war! and we'll make lincoln black! and grant! and hell, we'll even make good ol boy robert e lee black! no ... wait ... a muslim woman!!! but a strong tough muslim woman!!! who's actually a teenager rebelling against her overbearing evil dad!!! totally wicked!!! right ... guys ...??? i mean this is all the stuff you're weird teacher with the long red hair on one side and the short blue hair on the other side in the middle of transitioning taught you guys too in school, right ...???? 

am i the only person who thinks nancy pelosi and the obamas bought EVERY company in the world that makes video games? and then immediately installed an angry woman at the helm? or an effeminate and/or gay man desperately trying to impress/not make mad some angry woman who is about to take his job??? is there ever going to be a time when they make a game about an actual historical event that took place nearly a century before wokeness was a thing without injecting 2024 semen and bile into it before sticking it int he microwave and overcooking it??? i mean really?

my real, non-sarcastic/exasperated/fed up with modern garbage review is:
made P.T.E.16 (Post Trump Election in 2016) so of course it's full of woke silliness. any games made nowadays that aren't? further, to be quite honest, i wasn't as impressed with it as i was COD WW2, and i wasn't necessarily thrilled with that either. smash those 2 things together and yeah, it could've been better. alot better. but why do we need quality when we can shove nordic mother/teenage daughter terminator teams down the nazi's throats while black french soldiers run commado ops to show those whiteys what for!!! but get their brothers killed being too overzealous to tell the man to shove it and spend the rest of their life regretting it before telling the sad fairy tale that never happened to some kid who doesn't care 50 years later .... we are so screwed. but it's ok, i'm sure a bunch of girl power me too movement chicks will show up with a bunch of effeminate dudes to fix everything any day now ... annnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy day now......."
At the time of writing this it's just cheaters versus cheaters in the top scores. I had way more fun with this game than I expected though!
Fun game but they broke support for steam deck. Sucks especially when there wasn't really a cheater issue. Can't recommend

Why more ch**ting in game?
"blocked steam deck and linux users from playing the game by adding a subpar kernel anticheat into a 6 year old game, without any care or concern shown to people who were able to perfectly play the game on their respective systems."
"De facto abandonware. Issues with visibility and bugs remain unfixed, while the maps are generally mediocre. The gunplay is decent and on sale it's not a terribly buy, but a WW2 game missing so many factions is absolutely atrocious."

The graphics and animations are really good though."

TO MUCH CHEATER
Thank you for help. Now my game begining play.
"not fun anymore sbmm is terrible and there are barely anyone playing, it was good and never will be again, all battlefield games are complete and utter trash"
Less QOL and immersion than BF1... the WW2 setting and equipment is an improvement (BF1 really felt like a WW2 game with WW1 aesthetics) and there are some neat ideas but BF1 is still better.

this applies to BF 2042 and CoD franchise too . just play some thing PvE and enjoy your life brothers ."
"battlefield 5 more like shìtfield 5 because this game is full of shìt. Shìt gun, shìt map, shìt game mechanics. Like DICE is feeding me shìt when I play this game. yummers (/≧▽≦)/"
"I actually really like this game but after returning after 6 months i always get the same error from the crappy eaac: EA anticheat has detected an unacceptable configuration 115. Killed the standard culprits like razer synapse and any audio softwares, reinstalled the game, reinstalled the anticheat, nothing worked. I read on forums that this happens on brand new pc's so it is definetly the shitty anticheat. 

TLDR: DO NOT BUY! ANTICHEAT WON'T LET YOU PLAY EVEN IF YOU DO NOTHING WRONG AND EVEN  AFTER RESETING YOUR PC"

"Somehow banned before I even purchased the game and having never been banned in any EA game before and being able to play other battlefields without issue, EA declined my appeal, classic.
Wanted to see what this game was like now that its gotten some stability, waste of time and money clearly just get BF1 instead."
"poxy fucking players, that are cowards, who jump out of there plane when they know they are going to due"
This game is still so bad in 2024. Last time I played this game was 2020 and the thing I noticed is that there are more players. The connectivity is so poor. I got disconnected while playing where I got 50+ kills and the game was about to end despite my good internet. Don't recommend this game. I'd rather play Battlefield 1 or Battlefield 4.
not allowed to play it because its connected to a idiotic app called ea
𝕗𝕣𝕖𝕒𝕜𝕪
The solo campaign is great I enjoy the story and details related to World War 2 but playing the multiplayer makes me want to break my monitor the skill level in this game is unbelievable and makes me want to break something every time I get shot or blown up by a tank or plane and being shot out of nowhere from other players that I can't even see running around and diving from cover to cover like Call of Duty Warzone. New players I don't recommend picking up this game and hoping into the multiplayer unless you want to break something.
Probably worst SP campaign I have played lately. Barely worth the 5 $ in sale
Filled with cheaters and the game is no longer worked on don't buy it.
"In no way historically accurate, and cheaters in every game. Fun and casual game, if you want to compete with cheaters or are lucky to get a server with few or none..."
Would not recommend buying for the single player experience.
not worth it
getting ban for no reason while real hackers and cheaters reign every server in asia with absolute privilege
dirty game from dirty company
Why add a anti cheat that renders it unplayable for steam deck and linux users ? they should have left it like it was its not like people who actually cheat will stop cheating because of a new anti cheat. you cant even play single player wtf. dont buy this game if you use steamdeck or linux.
"Loading is so slow that I could have taken a nap before this game started. Story line is non existent, short clips of random crap that EA was able to figure out. Oh look you are running now, now you are sitting, now you are driving now and now you are flying. Great, thanks I really liked the characters and the story line of all 30 seconds of the game. Talking about flying, for some reason only the flying inverts your mouse and there is no way to re-invert it to be just like the rest of the game because of reasons. If you had plenty of that crap then you might as well take a nap because turning it off takes years. I don't actually know how long since life is too short to wait for this EA monstrosity to turn off."
i got blew up by a tank like im the school thot in the bathroom
"terrible, corny soldier skins"
"Well, here we go again ... in desperate search for a fun shooter after a long time, I grabbed this (older) one during a sale and finally decided to give it a chance. But apparently, 'long-term' fun shooters just don't exist anymore [b] these [/b] days.

At least not if you [b] don't [/b] want to play yet another [i] mainstream, (ability-based) tactical shooter [/i] or the next [i] cash-grab, toxic sweaty battle royale game[/i]. Thanks to the big developers/publishers for ruining what used to be fun for gamers in their hunt for the next ""whale"" and monetized battle-pass dependent piece of trash.

As for the game itself? It seems like a pretty decent experience at first glance, but already after only a short playtime, it feels like just another run-down, large-scale frustrating shooter neglected by the developers/publishers. I don't think it's necessary to elaborate much further beyond describing my first 5 games... 4 out of 5 of them featured the highly motivating presence of 1-3 small pp cheaters.

- I mean, sure, with level 13, it's totally believable when these guys are rocking a 60-70 kill streak with absurd kill-death ratios and a similar kd difference in the end stats ... but get gud I guess ... -

remark: yes, I'm aware its meanwhile a 6 year old game but I guess this review has already turned more into a general rant about current game industry anyway

In the end, I guess money always wins over fun. Shame on the people that contribute and make this possible by buying $50+ bundles every time they see some tits and ass out outfit or glowing RGB lights slapped on yet another (same) female skin — for the 20th time obv — rather than demanding anything better.

Is it really that difficult to consistently care for a community that just wants to play your shit for a few hours a day without dealing with all this other nonsense? Unique mechanics, good support and a diverse experience instead of mainstream bullshit that loses 90% of its player base in the first three months anyway, ESPECIALLY with all the insane dev tech we have rn, i mean come on ...

... just give us Titanfall III and don't mess that shit up at least.
Oh, wait, what's that? Apex made EA just $3.5 billion? My bad, I guess ...

I think people that play videogames just a little longer than before the Fortnite era would agree, games we loved back than and [b] do till this day [/b] are getting rarer than a fucking needle in a haystack and thats just sad and frustrating ... or maybe Im just getting too old ¿already? whatever I wanted just a fun shooter guess I'll play this one more whatsoever, what other, [i] better [/i] options are there anyway

However this shit in other words, ""Müsst ihr wissen"" — Der Präsident"
"constantly having to reinstall  to get the game working, there are others with same issue but it hasnt been resolved for years"
"At first it seems fun, fighting the war with your friends. But the hackers, man they really take out the fun from the game. With EA not doing anything to address those hackers, playing this game make me rate this a 3/10."
"The game is hard as hell even at the easiest difficulty level. If you expect shooting from the cover type of game like Call of Duty, this game is not for you. You have to think and utilize tactics. Disclaimer: I never play multiplayer, this is only about Single Player missions."
A really bad FPS that requires a whole lot of luck and patience which I don't have and only have veterans that camp in hidden ass spots and shooting my ass to oblivion and I couldn't even look at the horizon because a fat hairy dude just sits there watching YouTube waiting for a head to pop up and snipe it. 1/10
You know the game is bad when I buy the game on steam and have to install the ea launcher to play it really fun and innovative
"I usualy dont do reviews to any game,but the experience I had in this game was so horrible that I feel the need to share,i bought the game while it was on sale, as i have played bf1 for many hours I was expecting a somewhat similar experience, but it ended up being the worst fps i ever played in life, to start the war stories are horrible, different from bf1 the stories themselves are very senseless and woke, the gameplay is super boring from start to end, the only good story is the last tiger but its gameplay is one of the most boring there is, while on multiplayer its completely impossible, in every concept, it's filled with hackers and when a 500 level player comes is basically your end, filled with tank and plane, you spawn and die spawn and die a thousand times, it's just ridiculous, plus the battle itself feel dead and boring even its caotic battles feel boring, and this because i chose to ignore the endless amount of wokeness u find in this game, the character personalization is a total joke,if u like historically accurate games this one is the worst i have ever seen,overall the game is just horrible,it failed at every possible thing it could fail,in the other hand even tough inaccurate bf1 its predecessor is a wonderfull game one that i really love,in the end bfv is worthless and i regret buying it and wasting my time with it"
The story is full of woke marxist propaganda.
"joined a match, got killed through solid walls 3 times in a row. abandoned. it's all just cheaters and people who played enough to compete with them"
in iran need vpn for play this game :/
Just another stupid arcade game. Just play Hell Let Loose instead
"I got it for free, i want my money back"
this is probably the worst BF i have ever played. i had way more fun clicking the uninstall button than playing this heap of dog shit. it needs to die so Hardline can come back to life.
the players were more cheaters
stupid shit game fuck u
very janky
"It's an alright game. I guess it does its job, but for anyone who loved how immersive Battlefield ""1"" was, you may find it disappointing like I did. And no, that's not because women exist - the sounds and feel just aren't as convincing. I think it's perhaps how sunny the maps are...? Weird complaint, and I know realistically wars have obviously been fought on ""nice"" days, but it somehow just doesn't work for me personally. 
I also found that the class system doesn't feel as important as it did in 1. I found no satisfaction tossing out ammo or healing people because it felt less imperative and more accessible to all classes.

Meanwhile the singleplayer story was not compelling enough for me to bother with fully.

I will say that being able to customise your soldiers and weapons is great, but that's about as good as it gets for me.

Consider this a maybe rather than a no. If PVP is your bread and butter, it does its job well enough."
"Can't even play the game because EA f*rked up again, the launcher is broken and crashes, with no official solution being provided after all these years. EA at its best ..."

        [td]Battlefield V feels like a step backward compared to its predecessors. The gameplay is not as polished, with clunky mechanics and a noticeable lack of refinement. The content feels limited, especially when compared to Battlefield 1, which had a richer variety of maps, weapons, and modes. To make matters worse, the game is plagued by cheaters, which can ruin the experience for those looking to enjoy fair, competitive play. While it still delivers moments of intense action, the overall experience is diminished by these glaring issues.[/td]

"If you wanna shoot people 100 times before they die this games for you. Honestly the weapon play is garbage and its so unsatisfying to have to dump half a mag from a thompson smg into somebody to kill them. Even shotguns are pure garbage to use at ranges farther than 5 feet. Not to mention how weak tanks feel in the game. Like I get theres supposed to be game balance but its just so unfun to have to mag dump someone while getting aimbotted by snipers from across the map through tress with no line of sight. The amount of cheaters and just issues make me never want to play a battlefield game again. Honestly I loved the bad company games which felt great to play, but honestly call of dutys looking like the better option when it comes to gameplay now."
so much hacking and cheat brooo
kaki :<
Every other battlefield is better then this (even bad company)
Can suicide bomb in jeeps! :)

"-3 score The game had so much potition for nothing, Only the single player worth, The guns you can play on each class it will be or overpower or worthless , Dont buy it even in sales"
i can't play it in IRAN
"one of the better battlefields. 2 servers with a full lobby. The enemies' guns deal double damage and are 60x more accurate, you're gun consumes 2 from the mag for every one fired. Getting killed with any one gun always feels like ""that gun doesn't do that"" either doesn't have that many bullets, isn't that accurate, doesn't hit that hard, or a combination. Vehicles are the same. For all the AT running around it sure baffles me how tanks seem to always fk my day up, and the second I hop in one, the first guy I see nukes me into oblivion? Planes absolutely dunk on infantry, and whether it's because AA isn't real, or refresh rate is fkd, it sure as hell seems like planes are immortal, until of course you get one, and explode during the zoom in animation.

Oh, the squad res, and locked revives is pretty good, so it's one of the best battlefields on the market imo"

incredibly clunky aim mechanics. especially for controller players. I tried switching to keyboard and mouse and hated it lol. other than that the gameplay is dope.
Played my first game and ran into two hackers off the rip. I wish I could refund this game right now.
one of the worst battlefield

"Bad review for EA team
I was banned by red letter the day after I bought the game, saying that I violated the sales regulations. I failed to appeal twice, and was told that they could not tell me what regulations I violated. I bought a lot of games on my STEAM account, but I cannot unbind my EA account. Dear EA team, your mother is dead.

差评给EA团队

Doesen´t run well + that you have to install that EA crap that makes things even worse. Aint gonna play no more EA games.
honestly not that fun. Its the worst of the 3 I've played and its just BF1 but worse.
wont even start for me

Join a match of Breakthrough just for all the characters to look like they're part of a biker gang or circus, not an army.
Graphics somehow look *less* clear than Battlefield 1, especially the grass.
Then try to at least play Air Superiority only to find out it doesn't exist in this game.
THERE'S NOT EVEN AN AIR SUPERIORITY MODE IN THIS GAME

go play bf1 fuck this shit

"As a fan of WWII history, I was excited for Battlefield V, but the game is a massive letdown due to its blatant disregard for historical accuracy. Instead of delivering an immersive WWII experience, the game seems more focused on pushing modern political ideas, completely distorting real events.

The most obvious problem is the forced diversity in roles that simply didn’t exist during the war. Female soldiers on the frontlines, unrealistic customization options, and even prosthetic limbs that don’t belong in the 1940s take you right out of the experience. It feels like Battlefield V cares more about pandering than respecting the history it’s supposed to represent.

The Norwegian campaign, especially, is deeply disrespectful. “Tungtvannaksjonen at Rjukan” (Norwegian Heavy Water Raid), which was a critical mission carried out by Norwegian resistance fighters ""Kompani Linge"", is completely twisted. In the game, they replace the real heroes of the raid with a fictional female character. This erases the actual history and sacrifices of the men who risked their lives in that mission, just to fit a modern agenda. The operation cost a total of 91 human lives, while DICE & EA is more concerned about pandering to ""modern audiences"".

Even in multiplayer, the historical inaccuracies continue with unrealistic character designs that break immersion. Instead of honoring WWII, Battlefield V uses it as a backdrop for political statements, making it hard to enjoy for anyone who cares about the real history.

In the end, Battlefield V sacrifices authenticity for forced diversity, and it ends up disrespecting the people and events it should be honoring. If you're looking for a historically accurate WWII experience, this game isn’t worth your time."
"I have never been so frustrated with a campaign before. constant lag between missions regardless of the graphics quality, no aim assist, or ways to check on the mission even if I'm pressing the button saying it will.  Playing on Normal difficulty the enemies are tanky as heck 3-4 sniper shots to the leg and they're still alive. I would recommend casual players who like to play campaigns to stay away from this game."
"Like the game, but the game keeps on stopping when I open it, even after repair."
"the battlefield 1 is way better than this , nice graphics and details even stories , but the game play sucks . i just played couple of hours and returned to the masterpiece named battlefield 1"
"would be fine if not the blatant hacking and game breaking bugs, and massive random fps drops. texture popping and straight up Jank.

Not recommended even on discount, hell don't take it if they even offer it for free."
"Campaign was bad and multiplayer was alright, the graphics were awesome but not that awesome. Overall I loved bf4 more than bf5 in everyway"
"More COD than BF, shift to aesthetic purchase mode is tacky and takes away any possibility of immersion, doesn't feel like a battlefield game."
cant see shit in all the grass
Lousy fking game filled with hackers
"To play this game, I must download a new EA launcher and register an account, and I need to play it under the running of their launcher. The point is, they have a garbage launcher so the game keeps crashing when joining a multiple player match. Perfect game with a garbage launcher and terrible running program design."
"Too many effects, you can't see anything"
STUPID GAME CRASHING
"I took back my previous review.
the game is ruined by cheaters, there are cheaters everywhere, they are low profile as to only do wall, damage boost and building penetration, even on community sever they are unavoidable. however, it is quite obvious with their score. no reason to accuse them of cheating.
just quit the sever and join another sever or simply do like me, give this game a bad review and delete the game.
don't play this game in Asia, there are too many cheaters with no mother."
"Might be the most clunky dogshit game ever, terrible maps, horrible visibility and somehow the worst community ever. I don't suggest getting it even at sale. Get BF1 instead."
not noice
Unpatched connection bugs render this game unplayable 99% of the time.
"controls are garbage, feels like you're driving a boat even when infantry."
"Boring, Hyperbolically inaccurate
Kernel level Anti-Cheat"
"Just a shit show. I tried it during the beta and thought why not get it now during the sale. And after less than an hour of playtime I can tell you that it's a joke. I hopped into multiplayer to and I was surprised how bad the game was, and the agent customization made me feel like I'm playing Fortnite. 5 mins later I get killed ""redeployed"", and it happened several time in the span of 2 mins, maybe it's the admin balancing teams or something? So I changed servers and it happened again, apparently Hackers are out of control in this game and can just make the game unplayable (literally) for you. The exploit has been going around for more than a year without getting fixed."
Game is absolute dog water. Worse than Enlisted which says a lot.
"[h1] Battlefield V is a massive disappointment [/h1]

Battlefield V is a massive disappointment, not because of its core mechanics or graphics, but because of the rampant cheating that ruins the experience. Cheaters flood almost every match, using aim bots and wall hacks, making it impossible for regular players to enjoy the game. What’s worse is the absolute lack of response from DICE, the studio behind the game. Despite endless reports and community outcry, the developers have done little to nothing to combat this issue. Their anti-cheat system is laughably ineffective, and updates addressing the problem are almost nonexistent. The result is a game that's unplayable for anyone seeking a fair and competitive experience. Players who invested time and money are left feeling abandoned, as the studio seems more focused on cosmetic updates than fixing the actual game."
"Worst optimization ever, DX12 just keeps flashing"
"guys i already purchased this and refund it like 5 month ago, and now i buy it again but when i already pas i cant get the game why thoooo"
garbage game have to install ea just to play single player im glad i waited till it was super cheap. didnt waste too much money. now i know not to get anymore EA games. thank you for the learning experience
"It's nice. Never played a war FPS. But after the few hours you play the story and all is good. Then you go to multiplayer an you'll be overcome.

it's everywhere filled with cheater. Asian servers especially."
垃圾游戏。。。一堆bug，Z和C乱七八糟，蹲又不蹲的还得自己设置，望远镜缩放又缩放不了，一堆bug，能不能做好再拿出来卖。。。
"Battlefield V is developed by DICE and released in 2018.
This episode marks a return to World War II,
after years of modern warfare to copy the Call Of Duty games.

I'm not going to beat about the bush, I found the game abysmal, 
the single-player part at least.
BF5 has four distinct campaigns, each almost as bad as the next.

Billy Bridger is a former English delinquent who is as dumb as he looks.
In 1942, the army gives him a chance to redeem himself rather than rot in prison.
He has to fight the Afrikakorps in the deserts of North Africa, destroying as much of their equipment and vehicles as possible.
But the idiot can't even make bombs that work properly... 

Then, in 1943, we played Solveig Fia Bjørnstad, a woman of course, as Wokism dictates.
As well as being a real tomboy, the Norwegian woman fancies herself a strong woman but is totally devoid of charisma.
Mademoiselle will have to find her scientist mother, 
who is being held prisoner by the Germans,
and stop the export to Germany of heavy water used in atomic weapons research.
You can ski to get down the slopes faster! Isn't that great?!
And if the Germans don't manage to kill you, the freezing cold will!

Worse still, we play the role of a Senegalese Tirailleur named Deme Cisse in 1944 France.
In short, the black soldier and all his African companions must work to liberate France from the German yoke. 
As if it wasn't possible to play as an American or British soldier.
The developers couldn't give a damn about the French Resistance either.
It's probably more in tune with the times to have a black man killing white men.
This campaign is a disgrace from start to finish, a stain that tortures French history.

Finally, you play as Peter Müller, Commander of the Wehrmacht Tiger 237 tank crew.
In the ruins of 1945 Germany, you'll have to destroy American Sherman tanks, 
as well as other tanks and their infantry.
From time to time, you'll have to get out of the Panzer to shoot down planes with flak or recover important documents.
This campaign is quite great overall, but it's not enough to make BF5 a good game.
As someone who always wanted to play the Germans during WWII, 
it had to be in one of the worst games of its kind.

The characters are not at all endearing, in fact they quickly become irritating.
Fortunately, the single-player mode is fairly short, so you don't have to suffer for long. Thank goodness for that!

The staging is Hollywood-esque, with quality cinematics,
but the whole thing is weighed down by a stupid script, 
cringe-worthy narration and absurd situations... 
The pretty graphics and lighting effects, as well as the destructible sets, 
do nothing to change that.

The gameplay is very classic, 
and the weapons offer a pleasant shooting sensation despite the strange ballistics.
You'll need to destroy enemy vehicles and equipment,
drive different types of vehicles, including tanks, etc. 
Nothing really original.

Objectives are poorly indicated on the radar, 
and it's not immediately clear what you need to do.
The maps are huge, with very few objectives to complete.
I sometimes feel like I'm in a walking simulator, 
or being almsor alone in some insipid battle royale.
It's impossible to bend over without aiming,
health takes forever to regenerate, 
weapons are solw to reload... 
The AI is completely retarded, just like in Battlefield 4, 
probably to reflect the developers' lack of intelligence.
What would an EA game be without bugs?
Expect collision problems and enemies falling through walls!

Battlefield 5 is a total mess full of historical inaccuracies, even defecating on History.
EA has deigned to stuff it full of woke and cringe, so much so that the game seems to be at war with common sense.
How could anyone produce such a crap after the excellent Battlefield Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3 and Battlefield Hardline?
And what's more, it weighs in at 90GB! 
As soon as I finished the game, I uninstalled it, and I never want to hear about it again."
I play single player mode 3 times cuz it doesn't save the data every time I close this game. The bug does not fix after allowing this game to bypass the windows firewall. Dun wanna open this game again.
"I had the latest amd driver, but the game gives an amd drive 0.0.0 error"
"Game used to work perfectly fine in Steam Deck & Linux, now EA ticked a box and said 'no'.
Classic EA."
"It's full of hackers, micro-transactions. Hitreg is messed up don't even bother buying this trash."
worst bf ever
"6/10. the multiplayer is great but does have some issues, low score because the amount of historical inaccuracies, with the addition of a weak campaign kills BFV. graphics wise it looks great and runs smooth for me"
in almost every way inferior to battlefield 1
I do not recommend the story is weak and the gameplay is very weak
cant seem to play any games i bought anymore
"I love this game and the franchise. But the hacker issue and the way the publisher decided to cut funds instead of solving this issue seems rather unprofessional to me. Hence, I cannot recommend this game."
They changed their anti-cheat to one that does not support linux. can no longer play.
vehicles are OP and there is no cover in most multiplayer maps. and the hit registration still has not been fixed to this day haunting all battlefield games to this day.
keep crashing when join multiplayer server lol
get bf1 instead
外挂！！！
*UCKING DON;T MAKE A GAME IF U DON'T KNOW HOW TO  HANDEL CHEATERS.....GAME IS REALLY GOOD BUT CHEATERS ARE SPOILING THE FUN...EVEN THOUGH I BOUGHT GAME FOR 600 RS...STILL ITS WASTE OF MONEY BECAUSE OF ALL CHEATERS. DON'T WASTE MONEY LOL
shxt
"I have played it during months without a single issue, now EA decides to add its proprietary anti-cheat that will ultimately fail to solve cheating, but will succeed in preventing Linux and Steam Deck users from playing indefinitely.
Never support EA, they don't care about Linux or Steam Deck users."
"EA Splash screen, death to my fav jump-in jump-out game. d o g shit"
game keeps on crashing what can i do
"dont buy this game. too many hackers and ea wont do anything about it. even if you reported the hacker, it wont do anything. I absolutely smashed the report button so many time yet i found the same hackers for 4 games in a row without the hackers getting banned lmao"
Absolute dogshit
Not available for Steam's family sharing.
"I'm so tired of having Ubisoft and EA games in my library.

EVERY SINGLE TIME I try to play one of these games I need to install some kind of new launcher or anti-cheat and reset my password - but I can't because I've used all my passwords so I have to change it to something new I'm not going to remember and then go through this all over again the next time I play."
"Awful Game Do not waste your money you are welcome my friend, have a great day !"
"The matchmaking is non existent. You might think to yourself ""Oh hey, a round of a fun FPS sounds great!"" Until you join up with a bunch of basement dwelling no lifes that sink thousands of hours into this game and walk all over you. I just wanted to play a casual shooter, but nope, sniped from across the map right after spawning. Every. Single. Game. 3/10."
This game is so incredibly buggy it becomes almost unplayable. How long has this been out and it's still a mess? This is absolutely unacceptable for a supposedly AAA game.
"Hackers have ruined this game, EA's Anti cheat is stupid bad, and they dont plan on fixing it. Blatant Aimbot and server clearing happening, but reporting does nothing. Thanks EA."
"Denuvo anti-cheat ruined this experience, used to get 120 FPS constantly now I am sub-60 no matter what settings I have. Game ruined"
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME

I have played this game for many years; it was good, but since the last update, every time I try to open the game, it says an unexpected error occurred, and the game simply won’t start. I’ve contacted EA customer support seven times, but not a single person could help me or provide a hotfix. So basically, I cannot play this game.

Side Note: I tried on my Windows 10 PC with another account and on this account using a Windows 11 PC that is connected via Steam and EA, whereas my other PC is connected only to the EA account.

ive spent hundreds of dollars on this game for cosmetics the fact i cannot even play or open the game i paid for is absolute BS Shame on the lazy devs for not coming up with a fix if the anti cheat is causing this remove it because its not even helping anyways"
Go buy battlefield 1
"i laughed until i cried, what a piece of shit. so bad lmfao"
No longer works on the steam deck.
SHI
TOO MANY HACKERS & CHEATERS & WALLER & MAGIC BULLET & EVERYTHING! ATMOSCHRONOZ IS THE ULTIMATE HACKER xD
SO MANY HACKER AND EA DID NOTHING!!!! NOTHING!!! I NEED A REFUND!
SO MANY HACKER!!!!
devs doesn't know how to stop hacker. no penalties and no action whatsoever.
"For people, who like shooting with each other outside is a very good game, But for me, it's not very good. I want some maps inside a house and to play without tanks, helicopters and so on... And weapon is not so good for me.

If you like shooting outside and capturing positions - you will like it (maybe)"
"Dogshit game, buggy multiplayer nothing but tank spam and explosions everywhere. Impossible to have a coordinated infantry squad."
What is the point of getting this game from steam when it still forces you to download an EA launcher for it...
"Better than BattleFailed 2042. Worse than a bucket of sh*it. 

-Progression is horrible, assignments and other unlocks are dumb and you have to master your weapon by completing stupid challenges countless times (by adding first omg) for each stupid iron sight colors. That's disgusting.

-After you die before you spawn its not going map overview, instead going somef*ucktards third person view and pressing spawn if its possible. You need to click overview by yourself if you want. So you can clearly see what your dumb cant see while you are ghost and this is killing game balance. Its like you have wallhack sometimes. Player is in combat my a*ss. 

-Weapons also garbage, equipment , one time use grenades, useless gadgets

-Vehicles are totally cancer. You can repair only once most of the time, you have very limited ammo and destroying or using planes-tanks are the worst thing in this game. Planes? Good luck handling them after you use extremely rare plane spawn. You will see the engine at least then 20 seconds you will spam the respawn button. AA guns are incredibly powerful you can not stand with them even when a 10 yold kid using them.
You can call me noob or something else, it wasn't like that in BF1. P.S. im bad on flying planes but not useless like this game.

-Optimization is good but why the f*uck im having stutters at every single map starts for a minute?

-Campaign is also dumb like any other BF games campaign

+There are good things too. Maps are amazing maybe the best in BF or even any other game history. Hit registration is fixed from previous game BF1, and graphics are really really good

Even with those good sides this game is total garbage, reviews are telling the truth. Go play BF1 its way better than this. Do not try, do not buy, forget about curiosity. Trust me its completely mess. If you are stupid, go and buy some BF Currencies for shiny skins and please play this game for loong loong time with lots of cheaters

3/10"
"All the American Guns are garbage. The spawning is horrific. What works for others, will more than likely not work for you. Packet loss out the ass. Everything from Dice after Bad Company 2 has been a total dumpster fire. Fuck this stupid ass, piece of shit, half witted folly of a game."
"BEWARE CHEATERS! 
Game itself is great but damn, cheaters are rife. They openly gloat as well, clearly no admins.
Pity - avoid."
una pija flacida
"so many cheaters on it, every single match!"
You shoot a tank four times with a rocket and nothing happens.
i keep getting stream sniped oh mah lawd hawnsty fix your game
Game was great but EA hates steam deck
stupid game
"Its a literal gamble if you enjoy this game. With half the maps being really unfun due to their design either empowering mmg players or snipers as there is huge sighlines without cover you will most certainly come to a point where a whole sector is locked down as trying to pass will just get you killed. The visual clutter in this game is awful that even with character lighting there will be points where seeing the enemy is impossible Vehicles in this game are oppressive, if you thought bf1 had some annoying vehicles this game has double that. Most tank players rather just snipe from across the map then push, and as most players don't play assault or do their job, not to mention any reliable anti-weapons require you to actually be close to the tank, you just have them rain supreme, however planes are much worse. if you ever just want to farm kills without the worry of death, planes are just for you, you'll notice that no one bothers to deal with them, infantry players would just ignore it and complain about it chat, other pilots on your team usually get destroyed as the other team just has a level 500 pilot dominating the server. Oh on the topic of level 500 players, the team balance in this game is dogwater, matches will derail to being taking turns steamrolling, as there is no auto balance, or option to switch team your just stuck being dominated by the other team just being higher skill. Gun play coinflip, will you laser beam your opponent or will you miss enough shots to die to the enemy. Weapon balance is eh most weapons are kinda trash with a few selected raining supreme, you can expect to see people running the same type of guns and only switching based on the maps. The attrition system is god awful, you will run out of ammo, gernades, and gadgets all lot of the time, when you can really use them, By increasing the amount of teamwork need you really limit what a single person can do. which just makes the other problem mention above worse, and in this game I have not seen an increase of team work, support players will either by mmgs players or will be running around for kills then dropping an ammo crate or ammo bags, medics will either help the revieve the team or will play for kills. There are some things I like about the game like squad revives, the movement, fortifications, and the last tiger campaign mission, but besides that its really hard to enjoy it. This game has things that make me really enjoy this game, but the issues that plague this game really make it hard to comeback to it."
new update blocked linux support...
what a trash game dont buy you would have more fun getting you hand caught in a car window going up
"Just not worth playing. It looks great, runs well, and still has an active population. However the gameplay is unfun, servers tend to just be single team stacks, and hackers are rampant."
filled with cheaters maybe worth 50 cents
battlefield 1 is still better
"Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: EA online activation and EA app software installation and background use required. <----------------------------------------------

for have this transparency we waited 6 YEARS, and now they tell us they are spy us + let trash on or pc, NEVER AGAIN.

invasive, 30gb JUST IN ANTICHEAT ( game is 50gb relase date ) , spy each time u play + we all know what happens to APEX pro players, and this anticheat is the same one, so probraly u have some random spy instaled on the pc if u have this game instaled, this deserves a fullrefound"
Can't even launch the game anymore after DICE fucked something up in the most recent update. Can't play a game I paid for.
cant sex the guns :(
"The campaign is not enjoyable. Battlefield is known for its beauty and this game doesn't have it. Every single cut scene rubber bands like crazy and gives me motion sickness. You physically can not watch it. Then, certain key parts of the map won't let you pass. I.e. at the beginning of the second ""phase,"" you have to prone under a rock and I got stuck there for 10 minutes. I tried running to slide, prone, everything. Eventually I got past it by holding the forward button for 2 minutes until it eventually squeezed in. Multiplayer is OK but GOD is this player base sweaty."
I can't even play this game for a second!!! fix your game
"I saw a player using hack,"
THIS IS STUPID GAME ITS HARD TO OPEN THIS GAME !!!!
"Game is worse than most make it out to be. Visuals, audio, and the overall atmosphere are incredibly realistic. However, this is where the praise ends. The game runs fine in-game without latency, but has long loading times (somehow still in 2024). The playerbase either runs around mindlessly, camps, or cheats (which the anti-cheat does nothing to solve). Although the server sizes are large, the maps also seem too large and you'll find yourself running around just to find an enemy player. In conclusion, Battlefield 1 better."
This horrible game cannot save my progress i literally have completed intro TWICE AND IT  just doesnt save and i have to play that intro over and over again. Horrible game. Worst gaming exp i`ve ever had. Complete garbage.
too many cheaters.... typical dice do nothing.. uninstalled
64 vs 64. Still cannot find any enemies only way to get any kills is to camp with a fking sniper. Do not recommend at all wish they made it more 'confined' if it makes any sense
"Played Battlefield 2 and Bad company 2 and though this would be a good addition so I grabbed it. Played my way through the majority of the campaign (apart from the tank bit, because why lol) and had a reasonable time. Just reinstalled the game to test some new hardware and I find that I have to have an EA app now, which I don't need or want on my pc. After about ten minutes of the launcher and steam working together to try and launch the game I got in, just in time to sit through a five minute cut scene. After this cut scene, I was brought back to the main menu, where i tried to play the same campaign only to have the same cut scene re play. At that point I alt F4'd, and will now be removing the game.

It ran poorly on my rig when I played it last, and to be honest there's no reason for me to play this game now. Would have been a lot better if EA had never gotten involved but here we are. Dont buy it at this point, I paid somewhere around £50 and now it can be had for £5 on sale."
FUCK EA do not get if u have a AMD card for some random reason it can use your integrated graphics card not your main and will not lunch.
"Due to no linux support at all, i can in no way recommend this. I'm all for messing up cheaters days, but not at the cost of those of us that simply want nothing to do with windows..."
Why the hell can't I choose my team? Why do I have to play as an Englishman?
Great Game but Fuck EA Launchers
"can't hit 60 fps, stalls for like five minutes on startup and return to main menu, menu buttons take forever to respond, basically a virus but that's an EA published title for you"
I can't turn on the game anymore due to this new shitty EA app that they introduced. Do not buy this game unless you want to wait AN ENTIRE DAY for it to launch.
Soylords at EA added some garbage anticheat 6 years after release that stops Linux players from launching the game they paid for.
нет hardcore режима
"meh
campaign didn't intrigue me like many others. multiplayer isn't that fun either"
"The campaign is super short, sometimes makes no sense at all, and the gameplay is getting old and a bit boring.
On top of it, there is of course the politically oriented content that will make you feel bad during your few hours of free time. Always a pleasure. 
The visuals and graphics are, as usual with DICE and Frostbite, absolutely insane. But it doesn't make the game worth it in my opinion. Save some time, play something better."
"hackers enjoi 
dog shit match making"
"An invasive anti-cheat that doesn't solves the cheating problem and at the same time prohibits systems running Proton from launching the game. 
Can neither play or refund it. 
Paying for games seems like a huge L these days."
fix anti cheat and let mods work
"Do you love glitches? Do you like seeing floating objects and enemies moonwalking through walls? How about enemy AI that feels right at home in Goldeneye 64? Or maybe your thing is literally the worst hitboxes I've ever seen in a game. If you like playing half baked games which were never finished then Battlefield 5 is for you.

Now that I've finished the game I can honestly say I wish I hadn't. The game isn't fun at all. The writing was so insanely bad I can't believe the writers graduated middle school. All the dialogue were tropes and the names of each character have been used over and over again in other war games. They should never be allowed to write again. Do not play this game under any circumstance."
"crappy game but fun. sniper dont kill from one tap, tanks and planes have no realism when it comes to hit damage. plane can take 5 - 10 shots frontally and still survive when they should take 1 or 2 shots. similar with tanks have funny looking health bar . overall game shit. if you looking for true battle sandbox this game aint it. unless you play without vehicles."
I literally can't see stuff with those lights and smoke.
"This game is the worst in the franchise, yes worst than 2042, most unbalanced piece of garbage ive ever had the displeasure of playing, its not even worth $5 or even less, hell even if it was a free game its still not worth playing, save your money for a better game."
"BE PREPARED! spawn trapping by the ism is bound to happen. Not to mention you legit start off with an unfair k/d from the start up.... NOT GIVING YOU TIME TO LEARN CONTROLS. In general avoid this dumpster fire of ism where people have ""fun"" spawn locking for the 100th game in a row"
"I think battlefield 1 is better, in this game it feels like your running around looking for people to shoot, while in BF1 (at least in operations mode) it feels like there are actual frontlines"
Keep trying to come back cause the gameplay is really solid but the cosmetics are stupid and bother me a lot
The game is infected with WOKE. The game dislikes native europe people.
"TO MANY CHEATER IN THIS GAME, I CANT PLAY ENJOYABLE"
Hackers Hackers everywhere
"Эта игра шутка? Какого хуя она при наличии двух мониторов скачет то на один, то на другой, при этом постоянно перезапускаясь. Ебаный ЕА, расформируйте дайс и наймите нормальных программистов, а не дауничей с тремя классами образования (зрителей папича)"
dont buy this stupid fucking game its not worth it ea pos
EA Virus
"> adds shitty ea KERNEL LEVEL ANTI CHEAT
> Makes the game unplayable on Linux (which i use)
> Still has insane amount of cheaters

worthless company"
i genuinely hate this game
"Cannot be played while playing, 
what's the solution?"
"uneducated developers, they should have fix all that bugs"
Trash EA launcher. Doesn't show friends online so can't play together.
Unplayable unlike Battlefield 1.
"campaign is really really short. the new games are just a money grab for online gamers.
As far as enjoying a game in solo mode i think battlefield 4 was the last worth wile game"
"Even in 2024, this game continues to crash repeatedly."
If your half decent at the game it doesnt matter becasue all your teamates will be shite
game sux
"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A AMD CARD IT WILL JUST CRASH WHEN YOU USE THE M3 SNIPER NEVER BEEN FIXED

Used a 1080ti with no problem before have now a  AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX"
"good, but to many cheaters"
shit buggin
Fuck vehicles
ps4 have auto aim and no recoil fuck this rules
"plaah, almost the worst game ever."
"Battlefield V is a beautiful game with some interresting game mechanics that show great potential,I especially like the building mechanic in this title,while it’s more of a gimmick it give the players new ways to change the map dynamic rather than the standard objects destruction we seen in previous title,giving the entire game a more unique feeling.The movement and overall gameplay are also very good,the tanks customization are a welcome addition,we finally a more in-depth tank levelling system that is more akin to the guns customization we been seeing over the previous title.

Unfortunately,this game happens to be the most barebone World War II game I have ever seen,only four factions (Imperial Japan is added after the launch through the Tides of War live service) in the game with the ENTIRE eastern front missing.Congrats to EA making the first ever WW2 games that doesn’t have Soviet Union,eastern front and D-Day.Content wise is a big stepped down from Battlefield 1 which I adore.The lack of good anti-cheat also means the game is filled with cheaters,it’s almost unplayable in any servers that don't have admin.

But the main reasons it flopped miserably in my opinion,is definitely how EA handle the early controversy,release a half  complete product and attempt to fix it thought live service(which I think the video game community as a whole should reject)and worse of all,EA pull the plug the moment it doesn’t make enough money.

Overall the game has lots of potential to be a great fast paced WW2 theme shooter,if it weren’t for EA's terrible decision and it’s insatiable appetite for money.If you really want to play,buy it on sale.This will most likely be the last Battlefield game I will purchase."
"Battlefield 1 was truly your last breath before you perished, eh? Bought on sale for $5 and still feel ripped off. Unfortunately there are only so many progression-based multiplayer FPS games.
DICE, I just graduated and have no experience. In other words, I'd be a great addition to your development team and would fit right in. Also, please hire an actual art team for the microtransactions if you're gonna sell them for real money. They're almost as bad as the movement system in the game."
"This game is aids. How can a multi billion $ company have such shitty controls and bugs in a game. To whomever was responsible for that, please never program anything again. 


The multiplayer is even worse somehow. Unbalanced maps, shit weapon system, boring gameplay. Probably the only game where killing your enemy feels boring. 

I got this game for 1 buck on sale but anything more than that is basically a scam."
"playing halfway in the game the whole team doing good, squad mates following command orders, waiting for each other to respawn so we don't get squad wiped then all of the sudden you get disconnected from the match for no apparent reason it, well you could say ""oh just find another match easy"" but the immersion from the previous match you got just banishes from your sight. and it happens all the time i have a stable 30 ms from asia server and the other complaint i got is cheaters are still rampart even with the anti-cheat that got introduced last april 2024 even on community servers idk if its the cheater's thing that they can boot you out of the match. The singleplayer part is amazing no problem there, the music (especially the flute theme in the menu), atmosphere, graphics 10/10"
was great but the EA launcher don't work anymore for any EA games.
"If you want to die every 5 seconds to the tank,plane or a sniper play this bs"
fails to load.....preparing game then nothing.
game is inspired from ww2 not based on ww2
"I heard this game was bad, but I did not know how bad it was until i played it. It is like they took all the negative aspects of Hard Line, and BF1, then they doubled down on it. Most of the missions want you to sneak around like it is a stealth game. It is also filled with bugs. You can not hold more than 2 buttons down at a time. Enemies can take 3 sniper rounds to the head and still live. The guns are not accurate and then they are. You can not walk over a stick or a rock, but then you can. You can not shoot certain things enemies because there is an invisible wall protecting them. Enemies know they have cover because your view is obstructed by a leaf. Also the bug where you pick up a weapon and then you can not use or switch between any guns without reloading the game. When you are in a Tank and want to repair but there is a cool down and the repair stops when you are hit by a bullet. Not taking any damage, just being hit. At least I hope there is a cool down, because the repair just would not engage. I died more in this game to the BS and bugs the creators left in. All this in addition to the re-imagined alternate history of WW2 made this game horrible. It looks nice, but I think that is all the developers cared about."
"To start off its unplayable it messes with my second monitor that has important shit on there. and The game flickers and lags (I fixed it by changing the default settings.) shouldn't have to change a thing if your game is decent enough anyways. I started loading into the game for the first time and saw a women on the front of it, I thought this was a game based on history of WWII the halo sights are weird as well."
"Fucking retarded game developers cannot make a single game to run without issues. I am literally spending every 10mins at each game start to watch stupid pre-game video because it thinks I a new player. Surprisingly, after I quit the demo-version - it goes back to normal and access my account. Fucking EA, hire normal developers!!!!"
"woke EA games and their security team have taken a money first approach to Battlefield games. During gameplay typing aimbot, cheating and hacking is censored. Pretty sus. If you post to admin forums with videos you get banned for a week. Psychotic injustice there. EA objective is keep receiving money from hacking players. The point, perform periodic bans for kpi, wait for cheaters to come in with new accounts, therefore spending money on purchasing the game again. It's an effective loop cycle that maintains income. 

EA does not care about its consumer base. Everyone knows EAs reputation. They just stay quiet and hide hoping consumers will forget. My honest review is 5 stars for this game. From cinematics, server performance, time and detail spent from 3d animation crew. The maps are beautiful, their frost engine works great for environment weather simulation. The gigantic let down is the abundance of hackers/cheaters per game. Averages between 4-6 per game for me with all different names. If you play each day for a week you will definitely see between 30-50 new names. I love this game, im a very competitive player. But i cannot support a game and franchise that openly silences players that report hackers and does nothing about the hackers accounts. Youll see them on the next day or the next week. Its ethically bad, there's poor integrity and poor transparency with admins, and security team. 

I know its a huge hit to finance to investigate cheaters but youll save money legally going after known cheater websites."
bad
"EA has done it again, this game is complete ass. from the woke characters that were not realistic to the time, to the shit gun play. All guns have massive recoil and i cant seem to kill anyone in one shot but i die almost everytime to being one shot. fuck this game EA is a gay loving company fuck you"
"The battlefield franchise has really taken a dive and this is a prime example of it. The campaign is horrendous and you can't wait to skip the long boring cut scenes. Gameplay is clunky and shooting is inconsistent. I won't even tell you how terrible the online match making is.
Garbage franchise gone down the drain ."
"el juego de por sí funciona de manera extraña de a ratos. ahora no puedo iniciarlo porque dice que ya lo estoy ejecutando, reinicio la PC, desinstalé el juego pero sigue sucediendo el mismo error."
So much wokeness and DEI. Pretty sure all male DICE devs have permanent flaccid weeners and female DICE devs weigh like a whale.
Too many hackers in SEA server.
AntiCheat always broken im already install and uninstall it and nothing happend EA Trash
Bad maps bad aiming clunky movement boring experience
"Zero balance, game pairs teams full of beginners against max level clans"
"Stupid game should not be this hard to just open the game and have fun.

I have a problem with the intro missions always playing again and again and my setting always getting deleted when i close the game and open it again. On console i had 300 hours or so and was lvl 120 or something. And in those 300 hours i have recived less brain damage then in these 3 hours i have tried to fix my issue. Propably would have more fun playing battlefield 2042 with a power drill drilling through my forehead while playing the a game that i bought that dosent even work."
Crash serveral times for no reason
fix the fucking snipers
Feels like a big step down from BF1
EA is suck. also chinese.
"I originally bought this game when it first came out and didn't like it. I came back to it thinking that in its early release that it was just unpolished. That's not the case. Where to start? First off, everything feels like a nerf. From the anti-tank weapons to the guns themselves. Battlefield 1 had a very defined set of guns for each class where this isn't the case except for the support and recon classes. The weapons don't feel good to use, feels like they shoot confetti in the wind. The medic tools are slow to use and overly clunky. I can't tell you how many times I got shot in the head trying to revive fallen allies. The spotting system was almost entirely dismantled except for the recon classes, so I can't point out the sniper that's camping in a building. The tanks encourage camping on points, which goes back to the nerf in anti-tank weapons.  Ultimately, this game is half baked and poorly balanced. 1/10 for a Battlefield game."
there is no auto balance for the teams. DISGUSTING
Steam installed game crashes PC on exiting just like Battlefield 2042. EA  installed game does not crash on exiting.
Hackers are a problem.
Battlefield 1 was gold. This is mud.
game is full of cheaters mostly on and off
No USSR in a WW2 game.
Game keeps crashing checked online and only thing I could fine was that EA's anti-cheat is detecting something Msi center does as suspicious and immediately closes out the game as soon as I get into a match. Tried disabling Msi center and didn't work. Same thing happened to me in battlefield 1 to.
1/10
I loved BF1 because of the true story and full multiplayer gameplay specially soundtracks they were awesome and... so much but what happend to bfv wrong story The WW2 and 1 is famous because of story and events of Men of war but you destroy it with LGBT and Femenists nice! only multiplayer is a little entertaining after that 2042 completely fucked the game franchise suggest to don't make any more games EA your retarded that's all.
Game wont even let me disable HDR... so frustrating to repeat the intro part over and over again....
"Really, Really frustrating. How you can go from the brilliant smooth game-play of the WW1 Battlefield to this glitchy bullshit mess I have no idea. Every gun takes ridiculous amounts of time to reload it seems like you are CONSTANTLY reloading no matter what gun you choose and disarm prompts on the alarms just show up whenever they feel like. I fully understand why this game was so hated. Bought it literally for a couple bucks and was so mad I rage quit in the single player."
"Just like its predecessor, this game's single player campaign is extremely disappointing.
It's riddled with game-breaking bugs, which will never be fixed.
Additionally, the performance is lacking. There are occasional freezes and FPS drops, even on the best hardware.
Finally, the gameplay itself has many questionable mechanics. It's like the developers were experimenting with them, but in fact they were just lazy.

Many mechanics, like picking up weapons and ammunition, were perfected over the years in similar games. Yet in this game it feels like we're back to 1990 and the devs are pioneering the field with clunky and silly mechanics. So even when the game does work, it's just kinda unpleasant and doesn't provide the satisfaction  you'd expect from such a game.

The enemy AI is really weird. Sometimes they'll notice you from extreme distances while you're crawling in the bushes and start shooting at you. Since then every other enemy will always know where you are and be aiming at your position, even if you are covered. On other times you might spring through the enemies and they wouldn't notice you. Or you'd pick a loud fight with a group of enemies, and another, nearby group would completely ignore the noise.

The equipment management is also weird and often buggy.
If you find the same weapon that you already have. The two weapons won't share ammunition, despite being the same exact gun. Sometimes you may pick up the same gun twice and get stuck with only being able to use one.

There are many more quirks in this game. Generally, just don't buy it. Even when it's on sale."
Filled with hackers and report doesn't even work. Stupid game
"nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope"
POS WASTE OF MONEY
"Is this game worth buying in 2024? simple answer is no. the only active game mode is tactical conquest every other game mode is empty and you'll never find players in, so unless you REALLY enjoy that game mode then go for it and get the game. The game is really fun and i enjoy playing it but there's no player base anymore. i have seen a lot of people not recommending the game because there's hackers but personally i have yet to see any. my review would be way different if i were to play the game on launch, i would probably be playing this game non stop..."
"[h1] If you buy this game, be prepared to not be able to open it most of the time [/h1]
As simple as that. The same bug happens to my friends. 
[b] Do not buy this game until the bug is fixed. [/b]"
"The game is well made, but the EA publishers ruin the whole game. Can't even start it without brainfucking myself"
"This game has lots of 7 years players with aimbot wallhacking that still not getting banned , the anticheat in this game is so.. is there any ? not really working . others game were actually good with kicking all the cheating players in their fps game . if im gonna rate , it will be 0.5/10 game experience ."
"Dogshit optimization, DXR doesnt work, DLSS doesnt work. Imagine buying this dogshit game and struggles to get even 60fps Cant even customize ray tracing or DLSS settings. Game looks exactly the same as BF1 but cant run even half as decent. What a failure."
"If this was 100% on steam platform and not requires you to go through an EA app, all will be good. Because the EA app always crashes out of the blue and when you try to launch the game normally, you will run into 101 problems which gets fixed when you uninstall EA app and launch it through steam. DO BETTER EA."
no
"Iam writing this review as the game is running its curscene in the background. For the 4th time now.
This... game.. gives you a PROFSAVE_tmp for your settings which actually needs to be PROFSAVE.
That means the starting cutscene, tutorial and all your settings will have to be redone every time you launch this garbage.
I must say, this is a first for me. I have seen thousands of games and all of them at least managed to save my settings. Whats even worse is you had 6 years to fix this, and you didnt. At this point it would be faster to teach an earthworm how to rename the file and upload the patch.
This is the second time Iam trying this game and the most challenging part is getting it to work,"
have so many crashes
"It takes a hundred years to find a match, and once you are in a game, the teams aren't balanced. Overall, it's very boring and a waste of money at this point in the game's life."
game is dead and a money grab BF5 is not a Battlefield not even worth the sale price
"I bought the game and played it for less than two hours. The game experience was extremely poor. I was obviously very good. I just finished the beginner's tutorial and started two games without cheating. The game official banned me directly, but the feedback was still not lifted. I suspect that the official discriminates against Chinese people. I strongly recommend players not to play their games because they are too deceitful"
just add anti cheat
"Everytime there is a hacker, and its ruining the game for everyone and getting too much annoyed. Fix your game, it will be more better"
Game is dead as hell and plays like ass. Stay away.
"I have to launch the game as an admin directly from the folder, after that I click the play button only to be greeted with the game crashing. Suck my balls EA."

No I do not have ANY cheat software. No I can not play the game because I have cheat software."
"The game itself is good but  there is NO USSR
And no cross saving so all the hundreds hours on console are wasted."
😡😡😡😡😡😡The hacker ruined the game 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
No.
"Crashes after startup, tried contacting EA but support was of no help at all.

Super creepy seeing EA Desktop App can't be uninstalled like other normal apps, have to go tru REGEDIT which is insane. EA Desktop app should be considered a Malware just because of this."
TOO MANY NOOB CHEATER
"Why I wish I should have never purchased pathetic excuse for a game;

-Got released in 2018, no vs bots support despite the high demand from many players. However, they added it in BF2042. They added a co-op mode which you never get matched with other players, so it's just you and the whole army against you.

-The servers are dead, you get to wait over a minute for the matchmaking and then you get to have to wait as soon as you're matched so the game finds more players to begin the match.

-The servers are infested of toxic players; campers, trolls and try-hards. For example, the guy is God level in game but trolling and dominating lower ranked players.

-This game makes you face players who are 100x more experienced, more skilled, powerful opponents. You get in the match and see your team is formed up with newbies just like you but when you take a look at the opponent's team, they're all maxed out and ready to be  your worst nightmare.

-This game does not allow progress because opponents are too challenging to face; it's extremely difficult to fit in if you're a new player to Battlefield V, it's impossible to fit in and catch up with what is going on if you're completely new to Battlefield.

I encourage players to think three times before buying. I have no idea how it got mostly positive rating by players.

Pros;
-Breathtaking visuals
-Incredibly realistic game mechanics (destruction etc)
-So many details that make the game even more realistic
-Perfectly optimized, a medium end PC should be able to run this"
"Absolute dogshit, bunch of bugs and in general is not fun with the enemys being able to take sniper rifles to the head, and when i shoot a sniper rifle at their chest/heart its as if a blade of grass touched them. DO NOT PLAY IT"
"Easily one of the worst games ever made.  Woke garbage to say the least, but it gets a solid -4/10  You couldnt pay me to play this trash."
"A lot of bugs in every single game mode. Yes, there are cheaters. Also there is low online for some game mods. And I even didn't say about plenties of minor bugs.

For those who wants to get achievments - you will be very upset with this game. I've completed every story on the hardest difficulty twice and no one of the 3 achievments (for completing on medium, hard and hardcore) appears.

Overall, for $5 on sale it's okay, but it would be a way better if devs cared about their games."
"Game of shit ( as other BF series ).
Every 30 seconds disconnect from the game with no recconect button.
Was try all of these games and stil shit.
Reddit guys didn't help and told, that is server side problem, so please do not buy dat game!"
"The reviews about cheaters are not lying, it ruins it"
"dont buy this game even on sale , this is an abandoned stuttery piece of garbage game"
"This game fucking SUCKS. Its so bad i regret giving away 5 DOLLARS to play this incomprehensible, shit-steaming, fucked up nightmare of a game. The game is full of cheaters, server admins team stack which is, moving all the high rank players to their side so it becomes a one sided gang-rape for the opposing team, bullets pass STRAIGHT through solid objects 90% of the time, so cover is useless. The cosmetics are, well, do i even have to say anything?? Shotguns feel like i'm slapping my tip across someones face. SMG's, holy SHIT is the recoil fucking horrendous when you first use them. Sniping, if you're new don't even bother with it cuz you're gonna get smoked ALL the time. Most of the maps promote sniping because of the wide open terrain, the only fun ive had is on the urban ones where i don't get smoked light years across the map. I would honestly rather have a 450 lb dominatrix body slam me into a bed of nails while im naked than play this game, for the love of GOD, PLEASE do NOT buy this game, you will regret the 8 dollars you spent and jeez, if you're dumb enough to pay full price, may god have mercy on your keyboard."
"You buy game can t play multiplayer its locked like i am banned.
(Missing online access)"
"Playing BFV after BF1 is such a whiplash. They somehow fucked up every single thing that made BF1 great and then some. I have well over 400 hours in BF1 on Origin, here I lasted merely 7 (4 of which is the campaign), If I had to pick this game's greatest sin it would be that they somehow made using MP40 unfun."
this game have many shit map how the hell i have to fight 3 plane full bom with 1 spaa gun shit ???? all the map just have 1 shit spaa gun
"Game seems fine but it keeps crashing EA app is gay as fk, ..
hate that sht, .."
"I dont like it, fortunately I can refund it"
if you like getting shotgunned its fun ig
full of hackers
EA = ROUGH
"Such wasted potential, I originally played this game on gamepass and i was very annoyed and dissapointed when i loaded into the german campaign and saw a dumbass iron cross instead of a swastika. You can't call it a WW2 game if it doesn't have that, even more annoying is the fact that the USSR isn't in it either. What's up with that? the game just feels like a watered down family friendly WW2 alternate version. FUCK YOU EA. 

I have no doubt the multiplayer is good judging from these good reviews on it however you shouldn't be playing battlefield if you don't play the campaigns, It's such a soulless game without these crucial historical elements to make it an actual WW2 game. 

It's a very inauthentic experience as a ""WW2"" game, not to mention the slimy graphics that make the game look PG 13, if it's gonna be a WW2 game make it look gritty and gruesome, not some fortnite like graphics. 

Why couldn't EA have made the game like BF1 and added on from there? keep the same grittyness and excellent story telling as before but as a HISTORICALLY ACCURATE WW2 GAME.

you can barely call it a WW2 if it doesn't have the eastern front.

FUCK YOU DICE AND FUCK YOU EA"
No eastern front
Literally unplayable
This game is a lot like modern warfare. You're just gonna die a lot and deal with toxic players. Cool looking game but it's probably not worth the time.
bad gem
full of cheaters!
"don't bother doesn't work, just like all the crap that makes you use the EA app ,games just don't launch or play through it at all ,ive tried both this and battlefield 1 revolution and they don't work ,EA app is broken as shit"
"lmao EA is literally the worst gaming company second to none, not even one of their games is worth $5 much less the stupid AAAA price point, truly this company destroyus each and every franchise they have ever, are, and will touch, leaving them barren for the fans"
"theres supposedly a practice range but there isnt really, there are literally zero targets to shoot and the map size is the size of a large house

game is also absolutely full of cheaters

the game will also sometimes crash your computer after exiting"
somehow still terrible 6 years later dont fall into the trap of spending the $8
ww2 game and the ссср is not there
battlefield FIVE? more like i'm going to battlefield DIVE off the roof onto the pavement below after playing this game.
broke linux support with a shitty anticheat that doesnt work lmao
Guys do you have a solution for getting Crashed in the middle of the game. That happens to me when I play online modes. The only mode that I can play is story mode. and it doesn't crash.
having to install a second launcher to play the game is ridiculous
game didn't start up until randomly 3 hrs later and The first war story can't be completed
Too many bugs that have not been fixed.
Removed the map and locking thoes gunes i used + The enemy can pick tanks but my team can't. WTF are you idiots doing to the game. Not comeing back to this platform again. Minecraft is much better right now frr.
"Cannot recommend this game seeing as I can't even get past the launching screen and it then closing. Oh well, refunded I guess."
It makes no sense
Full of hackers and no one is banning them even after reporting
"uses kernel level anticheat so no longer works on linux/proton, yes it was unofficially supported but thats besides the point, they knew about linux players and still switched to a kernel level and there is still cheaters so nothing has improved :D

Never buying a multiplayer game from EA ever again until they decide to wake up"
This is worse in literally every conceivable way than Battlefield 1. I regret wasting my $3.50 on this.
Anticheat won't launch
"Every second I spent playing this game was actually painful. Horrible controls, gunplay feels off, consistent performance issues and frame drops, the revive system gives me motion sickness constantly, the menus are clunky and terrible, even spawning feels horrible because of the insane distance it puts you from the objective you want to be next to. It feels like it's trying to be BF4 and BF1 at the same time but playing this makes me want to go with either of them instead of this mess."
"For me, the best battlefield of the past 7/8 years, sadly, in 2024, it is fully packed of cheaters, you spawn, you die without even being hit by a bullet/missile or anything else, you die without losing health, some of them cheaters even teleport, others simple use aimbot, it is sad to see the most active game in the whole franchise, not receiving the proper love it deserves from the devs, DICE simply does not care, what a shame. When a lobby has no cheaters, it truly is a magnificent experience, from the atmosphere, the visuals, the audio... everything feels like you're in a WW2 movie, a shame.
You are not able to kick players and you cant report them, 2 simple features of any online multiplayer game, i think that says it all about DICE, right? Anyways."
game is absolutely brillant love it but has been ruined in recent anticheat update and will no longer go past the lauch screen wouldnt recommend buying until its fixed
no

never play it on a gaming laptop
"EA sucks, their app sucks even more, don't play unless you are looking for hours upon hours of troubleshooting"
Battlefield 1 but bad
No anti cheat? hackers in every room
"The EA logon window is confusing and difficult to navigate.
Additionally, the game is frequently unable to launch, resulting in a frustrating user experience."
Id refund the game if I could and buy a second copy of BF1 if I could.
"Bad, full of sweats, quite unbalanced"
it sucks
.
Smoke screen simulator filled with wall hacking cheaters.
"I really like the campaign, but it runs like shit regardless of settings, rendering it pretty much unplayable. About 10 fps when nothing is going on, and 3 in combat."
"Battlefield 1 > Battlefield 5

Plus the EA launcher sucks shit through a bendy straw"
"shoot, lag, die."
"dog shit game wont even start up. crashes instantly on main menu. Reinstalled multiple times. tried everything, spent days trying to play this shit made game. save your money and dont support these greedy fuckin cunts"
ea launcher won’t even let me play the game half the time…
"I'm just gonna say that I have seen a lot of cheaters in this game even after just buying this, either a teammate or at the enemy. It destroys the gameplay and is really bad when you just want to enjoy your game and have a little fun. Hopefully they can fix that issue. Even after reporting the player multiple times they are still not banned and still ruins the fun."
"The hackers have really made it pretty unfun to play. Aimbots are frequent and obvious without any real way to report them. Last night, I had a hacker ruin a server for everyone. The base game underneath is amazing, but without the technical support, the game has become a cesspool of cheaters."
Single player content is dismally short
ass
snipers and campers dominate this game
Your fking ea anti cheat prevents the common players
"idk what happened its suddenly unplayable due to frame drops and stuttering, dx11 or dx12 doesn't matter"
"Not a bad game, but cheaters ruin it for me. And yes, there are a lot of cheaters."
tigers with auto loaders iv seen it all now
"Why do this have pos reviews, I surely am not that blind to the point of not seeing anyone even close combat due to the awful contrast/brightness"
I love battlefield games.. but every damn one is full of cheaters that ruin the fun for everyone. EA also doesn't put forth the effort to help. I can not recommend the game for the said price because of this.
They changed the anti-cheat to be incompatible with Proton.
play battlefield 1 instead
they changed there anti cheat so you cant play on the steam deck anymore.
Dirty Chinese cheaters
"EA launcher is bloatware that takes roughly a century to launch.

Some of the worst menus I have ever had the misfortune to navigate.

Has the Bluetooth audio problem - easy enough to fix, but always a pain and just should not be happening.

I hope you're not in a hurry when trying to quit - it will take at least 5minutes to return you to the main menu and another 5 to reach the desktop.

I paid about 2euros for this garbage and I still feel ripped off.  Abysmal on all fronts."
"One of the worst games i've played, story was kinda cool, but every mechanic in the game is almost as busted as they come. Very little attention to detail, lots of recycled textures for things, ai is broken, the cut scenes glitch out, the lighting is poor, the way ai respawn is poor design, the ai themselves operate on a very low low iq level and i havnt even played multi-player and i already dislike the game. i see why it was 5$."
Fuck horrible game
meh
"I want to like the game so much. However, the spawn camping and overwhelming inability to have any effect at all because I keep getting put on teams that think they are playing Peppa Pig.... just kinda kills it for me. It's too bad they don't have any semblance of SBMM. I (someone completely new to the game) load into a game with starter everything and then spend the rest of the match getting absolutely smacked. Lame"
"i think i need to get good but i never seem to be able to do anything anymore. it does have its moments though, but i'd only nab it on a heavy sale"
"BF 1 was way better. World War II, and no USSR????"
"cool concepts. but this game has been released for 6 years and there's still many bugs even on the story mode. 

good graphics, story. but lack execution."
EA launcher devs I hope you kill yourself and your family die in the most painful way
"I'm not sure what it is but I just don't like this game.. feels slow and idk.. 
I wouldnt recommend it myself but I see why people can like It.."
i truly wish the worst for electronic arts🙏
Bullshit
Is not good
always force close .......
faggot
This is one of the worst battlefield and FPS games I have EVER played. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE
"GODD I CANT EXPRESS MY HATE FOR THIS, EA LAUNCHER IS LITERAL POO,  PLS DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS, UNINSTALL IT, SSHIT KEEP CRASHING!!!!!!"
I paid $3.50 for this trash on sale and it wasn't worth the time it took to download.
"i really cant recommend, i might just be bitch made, but battlefield hasnt been fun for a long time, last time i enjoyed the game was bf4, every game after it feels just so ass and i cant place my finger on why"
"So many issues running; does not want to run, once running the graphics appear much whiter than how it is supposed to be, the socials were not working, and more"
"Quite enjoyable for the sale price of $5 CAD, although the separate launcher tends to cause a lot of issues and will often refuse to boot the game if there is an EA service still running in the background. Only way I've been able to get around this is to open task manager, scroll through the services and terminate any EA related one."
"This game is just mid. Campaign could've been so so much better with the greatest battles ever fought. No soviets like really? It's trying to have a good prologue/epilogue story but it's just mid. Not goosebumps level story like BF1. 

Multiplayer is mid aswell. Apart from lobbies full of cheaters it is not as satisfying as previous games. Plus respawn rate of vehicles is horrible. 

This game could've been a mastery even peaking over BF1 with all of the possible WW2 content. It just did not happen as this game marks a turning point with BF titles just going to shit. Buy it in sale for a few €."
every lobby has someone shooting you from 2km away behind 3 walls with zero vision.
"Electronic Arts require steam players to activate their game through EA app since 2023. Before that, we played their games through Origin platform. But after they changed their game launcher, Chinese players cannot log in their account and launch their EA games through EA app due to area limitations. Chinese steam players have to use VPN to change their location so that they can create or log in their EA account. I don't have that kind of tech. Besides, it is too annoying for steam players to spend so much effort on launching EA games. Right now, I cannot normally launch my EA games, so I want to refund this game. Because we pay the money but we cannot play the EA games. This is totally a defraud. I send the above info to steam stuff, but they simply refused my request and closed my case. They answered me in the old sentences: Your have played this game more than 2 hours. Nothing else. 
Steam stuff don't care about your game experience;
Steam stuff don't care whether you can normally run this game through EA app or other third- 
party launcher;
Steam stuff don't care whether you will be cheated by the game developer after you paid your money and several months later the game dev added new launcher yet you cannot normally log in or sign op your account and start your game;
Steam Stuff Only Care About The Money They Take From You."
"I'm a bit of a warbuff, I enjoy at least some historical accuracy. I uninstalled and refunded in the first minute of my first match. I was killed while running through smoke, turns out someone was on a rooftop with an M1 Garand that was equipped with a silencer and of all things... a THERMAL SCOPE..."

"I bought the game expecting to see historical events that were true to reality. Instead, I didn't find a single mention of the Soviet Union, nor the option to play as the Soviet Union in a World War II game. For me, this is an unacceptable experience. Absolute garbage, continue to make just arcade games, never touch world history again."
this game is not good (dogshid)
Holy cheaters batman
"2024 and the game still has connection issues, crashes and some cheaters"
"I completely think this game is 0% accurate, it seems so sad that the german side never wins ;("
"Very bad single player missions.
100% boring.
Did I buy battlefield or Solo Stealth Man Game.
Where is my team!!!!
Where is the battlefield?
Why am I sneaking around as a solo SBS soldier??"
a lot of bug
unplayable i play for 15 minutes the game freezes then crashes
bf1 was better
.
issues with fucking ea launcher. Game unplayable due this shit
"Reached level 20 on Medic yesterday and didn't receive the Medic Mastery challenge so I made a case and I'm stuck on the waiting on player, but when I try to resume my case, It redirects me into a support page to try and fix it myself, but it doesn't work, and it also doesn't resume the case when I click it.

The game is fun though."
"TOO MANY CHINNESE CHITER IN THIS FUCKING GAME,"
Spoilt by people using aimbots and other cheats.
"You think on the 5th iteration of something they would figure out how to make bipods, spawn locations, banning hackers, etc work correctly.

Do not buy, i feel ripped off and i payed $3.50"
EA anti cheat - Making sure people who have zero mods installed are booted out of the game
"Ive played and loved Battlefield vietnam, BF2, BF3, BF4, BF1.

But this version is just bad, 3 hours and im done, cant play this game."
Война для девочек
What a shit effort. Not worth your time.
"This is just my opinion: 

(Maps Design) BF's quality was decreasing from here. Some or (maybe) half of maps are sucks. The designer map team don't know how about to make proper maps for BFV franchise, {honorable mention for the two worst maps; Panzerstorm and Hamada, literally sniper campsite & tanker farming}. Many sucks maps in BFV has some similar problems just like too much open areas, lack of strategical contour/assets (buildings, ruins, etc), many of maps having some good point but lack of map authenticity, etc.

(Weaponry) Gunplay is good but weaponry specialization was ruined the BF's weaponry authenticity. Literally, you can modify some of important weapon stats just by specialization. It just not feels like BF1 or BF4 and, any previously BF series. Gunfire is not really good for make any significant difference, because when you are firing some certain weapons for comparison, just like A3 and Type 100. If you are firing them, you just can feels slightly different.

(Movement) The player movement is feels so light, even its bit similar or lighter than BF4 player movement. Ain't no way if you can run with Heavy Machine guns as fast as you run with SMGs or pistols. So, the weapon weight and feels of equipping certain weapon isn't feels like BF1.

(Voice Actor) If I compare BF1 VA and BFV VA, BF1 VA is so impactful, great determined, and tremendously deep into the character. But i don't know how to describe BFV VA, they are just sucks, lack of soul into the character, annoying and their voice just feels woke plus cringe in many times!

(Faction) Let the Germany or France forces joined the Pacific War? Come on dudes. It doesn't make any sense!

(Costumes) There are some cool skins/costumes. But there are some unnecessary or ridiculous skins/costumes
Many of them are just okay or mid. Nuff said.

(Music) they just okay.

(Sound effects) Some of BFV sounds are better than BF1. Absolutely explosive in certain distance and planes machine sound. But if we take a long distance from battlefield, you just hear almost nothing! This is the lack of echo sound at outdoor area, especially if there's crowded battlefield that full of machine gun, explosive, bomb drop, etc in sound effect. Yeah, you will hear almost nothing, or slightly some sound effects.

(Graphic) The graphic is so aesthetic but its too colorful. If BFV can make graphic for realistic atmosphere in world war aspect, dusty and gritty just like BF1, I would gladly accept that.

(New Features - after BF1) Medic and Ammo Container crates in any conquered flag is so good for me, as I thought its great too for ammo pouch dropped from died enemy. As a squad leader, availability for calling some air supports (area smoke screen, ammo/weaponry drop pile, airstrikes, certain unique tank, etc) is so really great game changer for gameplay dynamics and balancing for any team side perspective. A health pouch for any class is okay. Only the worst feature was the lack of health regen and limited are so freaking irritating for any unpredictable circumstance in gameplay."
this game is constantly crashing i'm done with this shit
"Un- ranked game mode only, matches are always one-sided."
i think ill stick to bf1...
"The balancing in this game is among the worst to ever exist. If that wasn't bad enough, it is a paradise for hackers. I have seen hackers talking in chat about the best place to buy hacks. Dying franchise for a good reason"
"I got this game on sale for $3.50 and feel I wasted my money. $3.50 worth is apparently all the ammo you get for the campaign, too. ""Allied forces went to war with no bullets,"" said no one ever. Yeah, I'm sure we saved the planet with empty rifles and all the soldiers had to constantly pick up enemy weapons, EA. Good thinking.

Edit: It gets worse the more I play. Invisible walls in front of machine gunners and light-tower enemies. Forcing you to waste more of the limited ammo you already have to scavenge for. They can hit you, but you can't hit them even with perfect line of sight and nothing in the way. Perfect shot after perfect shot after perfect shot - to the head, to the throat, to the heart. Why is there an invisible wall? WHY?! No, really, answer the question. Tell us why you would do this. I know BF isn't known for it's single player campaigns, but my god this is about the worst single player experience I've ever had. What a terrible game. I've never seen a less smooth way of going down ladders in my life. Going up is fine, going down you usually just fall. Why are the first few cut scenes so choppy? Did they even test any of this, or just throw it together and release it? It's like a joke was played on fans. The icing on the cake is when you get fed up with this crap and want to exit the game, it takes about 15 minutes to do so. 3/10. Great job guys. Screenshots don't even work most of the time."
shit
"It takes all the favorite classic elements of a Battlefield game and throws it all in the trash. Different classes? Yeah but why bother, everyone has med kits now and can revive anyone. You can pick up ammo of dead soldiers and from random ammo crates. Spray patterns for all weapons are completely random so you can never master a weapon or use it outside of it's specifically intended role. I can't blow up wooden walls with a rocket launcher but apparently my pistol can shoot through the wooden door right next to it. There is now an animation for reviving fallen teammates making it more risky and less rewarding as you're granted less points.

The UI menus are a mess and unpleasant to wade through especially since you now have to continue through multiple screens to play the game. Pass on this game and just get BF4 for BF1. Those games are far better and still have an active playerbase."

hackers
"full bugs, full cheaters, no fun, this game is just a big garbage"
"should just get 2042 imo, you can run with anti tank mines on a stick at meatbags but the game's pretty glitchy, wouldn't recommend over many other battlefield games"
Clunky
nothing but broken programming and cheaters.
community moderators can eat my shorts
Just play Battlefield 1
trash EA even $3.49 is a waste on this one
"The core of the game itself is fun. This is coming from someone whose favorite BF game was Bad Company 2. It has some of the soul of that game in it, with even larger scale mayhem. It's worth it if you get it on sale for 4 bucks.

However, I DO NOT suggest buying this for full price. This game came out 6 years ago and it is still littered with bugs. The EA launcher is the primary issue, and it's utter crap. Half the time it will ""hang"" in the background, preventing the game from even launching. To fix this, you need to open task manager (ctrl-alt-del) and end every EA background process, then re-launch from steam.

Rarely when you spawn in at the start of a round, you'll be completely stuck in place, and cannot do anything. The only fix I've found for this is ALT-f4'ing and restarting the game.

Vehicle-mounted machine guns will sometimes glitch out and load a low-res LOD version for the ironsights, removing your crosshair and rapidly flickering the UI.

On some maps there are wall glitches, where I've witnessed people clipping into the geometry and shooting in from outside the map.

*EDIT* EA does not moderate this game whatsoever. Hackers are free to ruin the game without punishment. They can join your match, and force redeploy (kill) all players in the lobby repeatedly until everyone leaves."
"You have lost connection to the EA servers)))

Edit: if you are having the same problem, the possible fix might be reinstalling Punkbuster anti cheat from its official website, then reinstalling the game via EA App interface.
Game is ok, still a negative review because this kind of problem should not exist."
"Another EA game, Another hacker filled games. EA doesnt care about hackers. All they care are the money hackers pay them to get 60/0 games without any skill"
"I fucking like playing this piece of shit game, but EA doesn't let me play, you fucking EA, why!! what's wrong with you!!! because your mom and dad love me? so you don't let me play eat shit you asshole!!!!"
no
Hackerfield V
Absolutely garbage game but for 3$ its got just enough fun to be had
Wasn't even worth the $3.49 I spent on the summer sale. How tf do you get your CUTSCENES to lag?
The most boring one in all of the games plus wont even launch correctly half of the time because of ea launcher yet I still play it because somehow its the one with the most players
"The number of cheater is insane, its is fun game thou, what a waste of good game"
Complete garbage
"I never have issues with steam games, but this game runs through the EA App and upon launching the ea runs for a bit then close making the game unplayable for me. It worked for a bit and is now doing it again. Just googling the issue I find players having this same issue for years with the EA app and still no fix. Buyer beware."
well i dislike that i cant play it on my steam deck
"Holy hell this game sucks! Campaign is so glitchy that if you die in certain areas it just skips part of the level. So repetitive, unclear how you are supposed to approach levels, tries to be open world but the levels are so linear it defeats the purpose. EA launcher is a mess and also changed settings on my GPU which has now made my screen start to flicker."
"Advertised as back to the roots experience. Well that is a lie. You level your guns enhancing them beyond what beginners get. Therefore it is always unbalanced and you gonna suffer as a beginner. Not (just) because you are new but because you are outteched. That is the reason for the ""negative"" review.
Cheating is not punished directly to save your system performance. You can report though.

Other than that it is the classic BF experience. Squadsystem is a huge plus. Sound is great. Visuals are nice. There is a single player campaign and a SquadPvE too."
"Can't really say much more other than... this feels like a soulless game, the campaign is terrible, short of value and any good gameplay mechanics, the first mission you play you will literally be able to use a vehicle that makes you invincible and also kills enemies by simply TOUCHING them, no need for speed at all and the physics on enemies immediately gave away what kind of game i was going to play as they were just laughably bad when they would die.

Movement and Gunplay are subpar and objectively some of the worst in the entire franchise, the slide is janky and causes your camera and viewmodel to shake left and right when you attempt to aim down the sights, they decided to stop your ability to shoot while vaulting over obstacles but the worst part is, how the gunplay now has random recoil, instead of recoil patterns like BF4 did, the recoil is also affected by your field of view with lower FOV being much much worse than high FOV, some guns and sights aren't even properly centered, the fact that your aimpoint isn't even on the center of the screen but instead is tied to your guns recoil makes this flawed gameplay element feel even worse, overall this game isn't deserving of more than a 4/10 as the multiplayer maps are just as bad as the ones present in 2042, glad i waited for this to be dirt cheap but unfortunately overall it just doesn't feel like a battlefield game, merely a cash grab really."
EA trash
I got this game for $4 on special and still feel ripped off. BF has turned into a COD impersonating game the devs should return to play a few games on BF1942 and Vietnam to remember what it is all about some of the functions in the game were cool like Bayonet charge and towing artillery etc but the maps were underwhelming and the gameplay resembles more of a COD feel then a Battlefield feel the old Battlefields and BF3 were huge and the war was amazing.
Decent game but you need the fucking EA launcher to even play this game even though you bought it on steam which is just BS.
shitty game i hope dis game sends us into a world war
"Worst Battlefield I have played. Almost the worst game I have ever played.  No map. No direction. Keep telling me to return to area when I have no idea where I'm going or where I'm suppose to go. This will be the first Battlefield that I will not finish. I might come back and continue when I have all the time in the world and have absolutely nothing else better to do.
Invisible wall; enemy can shoot at you, but you cannot shoot back. Smokes (not flash bang) in your area; you cannot anything around you. All you see is black smokes. But all of the enemies can see you clearly and shoot at you."
"hackerfield
a simple kick to vote would have solved everything but nah"
CHEATERS
"rubbish game, there's lot of cheaters and those chinese soyboy players keep kicking me from the game for no absolute reason, even though i somewhat owned in score match, i regret i bought this game, even the price was laughable. play BF1 instead of this."
"I could ignore alll the bugs and glitches but what I cant ignore is the fact that there are constantly problems with connecting to multiplayer games. It is the game not my system. everything else works. 
I just get dumped into main menu instead of loading into a MP game. SP works just fine ( well except some of the game breaking bugs which come up some times...."
game sucks i never played it 👍
"Good game, but find yourself a dedicated server the kill time is crazy, guy can get shot by a sniper round in the chest run off heal and repeat. found a hardcore server WAY WAY WAY more fun."
Gimmeh more tank gameplay >:(
"A meh addition to the Battlefield franchise with a campaign to be ignored and a cheater problem. Abysmal UI and general gameplay. Ear-no-no-sexy loud with no ability to change the volume for several minutes. Unskippable and annoyingly loud intro. All-in-all I can only assume development was a nightmare if this is what we got.

4/10.

Update 8/1: Steam has refused my refund request 4 times. The Multiplayer does NOT work and is FILLED with cheaters, the Campaign is BAD, the Writing is WORSE, and the Gameplay is a 6/10 at its best. This game is a disgrace to what I remember from Battlefield 3.

 ...and, because it takes more than 2 hours to test, meaning Steam has lost the monetary incentive to listen to you, there doesn't seem to be a chance at a refund for a broken and abandoned $4 scam. You will not receive the experience/gameplay described, after paying money for it. You're better off buying a fucking case and key in CS2... but do it in LoL or Valo, not here!"
nagyon nem jó
"Gotta say, after putting a few hours into this game, I don't recommend for even battlefield vets.

My review is heavily weighted towards older battlefield and old DICE games, on top of the ridiculous initial marketing for this game.

I have played Battlefield 1942, Vietnam, Battlefield 2, 2142, 1943, Bad Company 1 and 2, Battlefield 3 and 4, and finally but not the least Battlefield 1

The movement of this game, is incredibly smooth, [b]Too Smoth[/b]. That is a bad thing, because these games always had the core movement of the player character in mind while scaling maps and balance. It actually feels like i'm playing more modern call of duty with how fast people move in this one, it does not fit.

The Character customization is a complete mess and whoever was in charge of the clothing department, good work but also wow how did you screw up so hard by letting us make monstrosities, half of the time without the spotting system i couldn't tell if the guys i'm shooting at were friendly or enemies, it's [b]that bad[/b]

Gun balance was left in a state of it favoring heavily towards full automatic and broken weapons at close quarters, instead of punishing that kind of gameplay by letting other players mow them down with high powered rifle fire or machine guns, they cater more to.. what appears to be the Call of Duty Crowd which is really awful to think about.

Vehicles were nice but there could've been way more, and more than half of them were Frankenmachines. They missed out a lot of more iconic planes and tanks as well which sucks.

There are two good things about this games single player, yes that one.

The Prologue was actually okay, however with the amount of historical inaccuracies and ways to break immersion by not being authentic enough it actually loses more points than gain any. I wished the pilot segment was fully fleshed out as a campaign in it self, not sure why they decided to not include that, especially since BF1 with its war stories had one when launched.

[i]Oh and The Last Tiger was the only good one just as a note.[/i]

With how disrespectful this game was to WW2 veterans and those who made the ultimate sacrifice in fighting evil, this game sure likes to erase those same heroes and make up brand new ones and completely fabricate history for sake of modern political activism to younger more gullible generations. Also for a game about us shooting Nazis, there are sure lack of them at all to shoot at, weird.

Overall, even on a sale of $3.49. This game is just simply not worth your time if you prefer older battlefield games, its novelty wears off fast and it's just not a fun game. They did some right in terms of gameplay but most of it is bad, and context wise.... This ones a write-off.

Oh and there are a lot of cheaters in this too so, be warned you're probably going to be fighting a bunch of them if you're going to touch Multiplayer."
"The game is amazing! Astonish graphic and everything but it's literally impossible to play. FULL of cheater, the movement of the soldiers is unnatural people is moving at 200 km/h and slide like if was running a snowboard so it;s impossible to target people. Instead the cheaters target you from the other side of the map in 1 sec and kill you whit a single head shot. It's only frustrating! What a SHAME"
The launcher never works. Get rid of it
"Wokefield 5, I can't believe 101th Airborne has femboys and women... You don't contribute to certain people's rights by pooping into games with ""historical"" claims. Just call it fiction if you gonna add imaginery things bruh"
Just get 2042 its better
not worth full price
"classes unbalanced recoil is dumb on some weapons. 

You will come to hate recon/sniper being able to just insta click your head in under the latency time.

meh if its like $3."
"No audio bug for windows 10, I have to reinstall this game to fix it"
wont launch after the new anticheat update
"got this for less than $5, still has the same balancing issues from 4 years ago and ea will never ever touch this game"
New kernel-level anti-cheat system has made it impossible to play on Linux. Neither Wine nor virtual machines are working.
So many bugs
"A game that disconnects you from EA's server every 5 minutes with no error code. Bravo EA, thank you for the useless launcher and even more useless broken online in your game."
"This is like a poor man's bf1. Boring as hell, controls are clunky, wall vaulting is super awkward, and the hacking infestation is ridiculous."
battle field 1 100 times better. maps here are way too small its total call of duty..
"Fun game, but the EA launcher should be tried for crimes against humanity and put away. Why do we need a second launcher when we buy a game from Steam? Does anybody at EA care about making a good product that people will want to play?"
"For a corporate game, it's okay. The maps are pretty, and the loading intro is annoying (I was confused why I was forced into the single player intro).  The game is close to the quality of the original Battlefield, but definitely not as fun. I feel at times it's trying to make itself like all other multiplayer fps' with silly stats, points, and character customization. I wish we had the quality like Bad Company 2.

I blame influences from Call of Duty and their work on Star Wars Battlefront for how the game is laid out. The messages that cover half the screen are hardly relevant; I don't want to see announcements of when the first teammate is killed. This game is a sniper's nightmare, where everyone is aware of where shooters are before, and especially after, getting killed.

It's pretty looking though."
Hackers everywhere
"Crap Game made by greedy devs. Hackers everywhere. DICE can go suck a fat one. UPDATE: still crap, fuck the devs on their shit game. insta killed every time I load in. no way around it. just insta killed every time"
"The amount of cheaters running so rampant and the developer doing nothing about it even after reporting seems to show a general lack of care as they work towards the next instalment of another hacker infested game.

Hackerfield 5 - Where banning hackers is a ""LEGACY"" feature"
Dont buy this
Frequent crashing and disconnects
Was a GREAT game but it's dead now
"Games been abandoned, overrun with cheaters but was fun otherwise. The same cheaters have been doing the same thing for months and I'm talking dozens of grenades thrown at you, respawning everyone on the map, speed hacks, noclipping etc so its not just your casual aimbot but literal round ending cheats."
As far as I can tell we're still playing against the same blatant cheats people have been using since BF3. There are zero server enforcement tools and servers are named with long series of numbers so you can't even avoid the bad ones (they're all bad though so don't even try). Nobody should be allowed to release a PC shooter until they've fixed anti-cheat
lost connection to server constantly
"Thought I'd try this, as the last one I played was Battlefield 3 and this was on offer. Got a refund after just two hours of game time, and all of all that was just trying to get the control settings right.

Shouldn't be having to do that. You should just be able to jump into a game and enjoy it.

Not admin the fudge out of it!"

"I don't like leaving negative reviews, but I just couldn't help myself this time.
(FYI, this is strictly a single-player review.)

When I buy a war game, especially one called ""Battlefield"", my intention is to fight in battles. 
75% of the campaign missions I played were stealth or infiltration missions where you, all by your lonesome, *have to avoid combat* unless you want to be outmatched and overwhelmed by a horde of enemies.  I don't mind the occasional stealth mission, but one or two throughout are more than enough for me!  The following is a glimpse of my experience...

Story 1:
Mission 1: Stealth - ""Okay, that's fine, let's get it out of the way early.""
Mission 2: Stealth – (Pinky already hurts from mashing the crouch) ""F- this, I'll do it later...""

Story 2:
Mission 1: Stealth - ""SIGH!!"" Alright, fine...  Let's get this over with!
Mission 2: Stealth - ""Oh, ffs...""  (Proceeds to ignore all stealth and shoot my way through)
Mission 3: Stealth - ""OH FFS!!""  (Starts with neat skiing section that's over way too soon, get bored and quit)

Story 3: (Is Prefaced: HIGH INTENSITY!)  ""LET'S. ****ING. GO!""
Mission 1: Awesome battle! Genuinely fun!  More of this, please!!  Loved it!
Mission 2: Guess whaaaaat...  You're separated from your squad for a STEALTH MISSION!!! WEEE!!! (Quits)

Story 4:
Mission 1: WW2 Tank Battle?  ""Dope!""  But you're the Germans! ""Less dope, but whatever, let's play."" 
Shoot stuff for 5 minutes... kind of fun.  Just getting into it. Game crashes.  Roll eyes.  Comes here to write review.

If you like stealth missions, then check this game out.  If you're looking for cool battles, you might want to look elsewhere.

Also, when the player is in a story section, please just make it a cinematic!  I was Usain Bolt 2 seconds ago, but now that someone important is yelling exposition at me, I'm restricted to going half the speed of a Grandmother with arthritis?  It might seem silly, but it's insanely frustrating being ""in control"" of your character but suddenly having all of your mobility drained just because it's story time.  If it's a cinematic then I'm not forced to actively try pushing through the irritating narrative molasses you put in our way.  I'd rather sit back and enjoy whatever story you're trying to tell rather than get angry that I'm stuck running in slow motion.  That is literally a thing that people have nightmares about lol."
Unsure if it's the younger me enjoying battlefield but I personally feel like this game does not hit as hard as battlefield 1 did. It's still good but cheaters have utterly ruined the game.
Dogshit game servers are busted
"They nailed that campaign, but multiplayer sucks when you have to use full magazine on dude that kills you with 2 bullets."
"EMpty, boring , not immersive, bad game play logic, horrible intro but diverse."
Runs it was launched off of EA.
mid as shit
I have a great internet conection and this shitty game cant even connect to the servers not to mention playing with fellas
"This game is a big disappointment. BF1 is way better then this. gameplay, atmosphere, graphics are terrible compared to BF1. Its like a battleroyale game. Way too colorful and maps are too bland. Also, its insanely inaccurate. This is a ww2 game not a modern war game. Playermodels are so stupid. There was no black women as snipers in the us army. Soldiers did not have punk hair. Also, Where are the soviets? Where is the Operation Overlord? Battle of Stalingad? these were the most important events in the ww2. And EA decided to not add them. Very little content. Also you cant get serious while playing. In BF1, it felt like real war. Screams, bombs exploding everwhere, teammates getting destroyed by artillery in front of you etc. This games purpose was to replace BF1. But the opposite happened. Its not that terrible, playable, but did not impress me. 4/10."
Im actually amazed at just how bad BF5 is
"WORST FUCKING GAME.
EA NEVER MAKING A GOOD GAMES"

Here I will leave this beautiful Capybara, whoever passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up (I need Steam Points)."
Game is no longer playable on my system - some fault between steam and the EA app prevent the game from launching and EA has been unwilling to fix the problem.
"EA forced the game to have kernel anti-cheat (EAC), making it impossible to play on Linux."
Not worth the $$ for a few hours of solo play. Probably ok if you want to online FPS.
dont even bother trying the campaign on hardcore....
"playable, but mid tbh overall"
Crashes constantly and the EA app is terrible
"Game is mostly dead it seems. There are very few servers during the week and absolutely no hardcore servers during the week. I've been told its a bit better on the weekend, but the game is not worth it at normal price as it seems it was barely worth the 4 I paid during summer sale. Personally i only play hardcore and got lucky enough to find a single server the day i got on and it was very fun, but the past 2 or 3 days I've been disappointed with the lack of servers."
"""ea anticheat has detected an unacceptable configuration please ensure no cheat-related or tampering software is active and restart the game 115"" unplayable shi7. Im so happy i gave only 3$ for this shi7"
"This is the first Battlefield i ever played and it will probably be the last. 
Although the looks are really good and even the dialogue of enemy soldiers is funny at times.
I have been playing a lot of different shooters but never ever did the shooting feel so off like in this game.
For example sniping a standing target while standing still myself the bullets just sail right through the enemy for whatever reason. Even normal rifles just seem to miss shots that are 100% on the enemy, that just killed the fun for me completely. 
I must say i would be really mad if i had payed more than a few € for this."
honestly not even worth 3 bucks!
"The gameplay is alright and all but just launching this piece of EA shit is way too much work. I had to dig my way through the files to manually install the anti cheat and the fact that launching this game has to go through EA's own launcher (which is a huge shit show within itself). It isn't worth the trouble, just play bf1."
Doesn't feel like working not launching waste of money don't buy it or any battlefield game on PC . Lets all Show EA we mean business no more PC gamer money .
ping is too high
Refunded... Doesn't work on Linux anymore due to Anti Cheat.
The game crashes to desktop and leaves no hints in the event viewer in nearly every game I play.
cant get any matches :(
"yeah, no."
fuck ea
no pacific campaign? sad
"the chynese shouldnt be in this game, please ban this game in chyna"
"sadly not anymore, is a great game but in aus for me its unplayable to much lag sad as i enjoyed it"
fuckkkkkkkk
terrible game dont buy it sucks it is not fun bc it gets to laggy
Shitty game
I spent money on this game to play on steam deck when I first got it in 2023. Then EA decided I'm not allowed to play it anymore with there bad anti cheat. Thank EA for stealing my money
"I tried, I realy did try to enjoy this and I did for a brief moment in time... I feel like 50+ hours is more than a decent attempt and fair chance.  EA does not give one tiny flying ants worth of care with regards to stopping the cheaters.  They care about getting your dollars, taking those dollars, keeping those dollars, and then trying to get more from you by letting the game go to rotten steaming dung by not maintaining it and then when you're sick of it they'll sell you the solution boxed up as the something new, but the truth is, it's the same old thing with a little more spit and polish and you know what, all it will take to get that new game that maybe doesn't have a bunch of hacks on it is another pile of your hard earned money.  I'm so thankful I only gave them about 3 dollars, but I'm sad I spent so much time trying to like the game and convince myself that maybe it was skill issue and not cheats/hacks... but no, I've been playing games long enough to know the difference between someone schooling me with skill or using wallhacks/aimbots/etc... this game and all EA pvp games are riddled with horrible hacks and they won't do anything to resolve the issue because they don't think it hurts the bottom line regarding finances.

Edit:  ""you've played 26 hours more since review, would you like to revise your review?"" --- no Steam, I would not like to revise my review.  I have had some of the most frustrating rounds of gaming ever due to the unhindered cheats/hacks plaguing this game.  I am still playing only out of lack of decent competition on the grand-scale-war games... I don't want to pitch out for the most recent call of duty because it's simply not worth their asking price, so SADLY, this is the populated game I've found to scratch my itch for this game style.  I'm not going to grade it on a bell curve, just because the other games of this style are equally as bad or worse or simply not populated on the servers doesn't mean this game is good... it just means it's not the worst."
"fuck EA, wouldnt be playing it if the recent one was good"
"Feels cheap. No joke, this game looks like a cheap copy of BF1. The multiplayer gameplay feels like a college end-of-semester project with all the assignments combined into one. I do not recommend this game. Just play BF1 instead."
"From the very start, this game is plagued with graphical issues like texture pop-ins and stuttering objects.
The narrative is insanely preachy and takes itself so seriously in a grandstanding manor that you find yourself hating it.
Artistic/aesthetic design choices that force you out of the idea that you're in a world war 2 setting.
Battlefield as a franchise keeps getting more fast-paced, resembling a wild movement shooter, whereas in the GOAT that was Bad Company 2, movement was limited and the game felt more grounded in reality.

Thank god I bought this at $4 because I could not imagine paying $60+ for this"
Nah crashes loads
"Hacker in every single game, almost 0 before super deluxe ultimate edition anti cheat technology implemented."
NOT FUN
Should have gone all-out and added more content to this game instead of the heap of garbage that is 2042
POS ANTI CHEAT
Not even worth the $3.49 with how many hackers are in this game.
Battlefield 5 is nothing like  Battlefield  1
"This game is ass now days i used to run mods for rehauls and when i got the news EA was deleting files in Battlefield V i felt dissapointed and this game is finished and no longer recieving updates like WTF and also the game is a full of Cheaters ruining the game and you intended this game to be ""Historicly accurate"" you only scratched the Surface you got not much right but some but also this game is political is what ruins the game i hate the cosmetic system and the pre order cosmetics system you could of done so much more with this game BUT NO! you had to rush the game and this is what we got wow i am highly dissapointed for the history and stuff this game had to go through but its still somewhat a good game in a way i only like the campaign levels i would only buy this on a sale."
Absolutely bad.
Ah hell no. Go back to BF1 or older games.
"i bought this game, in hoping to play. but hell, i can't even open it. it's the EA launcher that won't let me and told me i do not own the game. i have tried various effort to fix. wasted 3 days. 

it's just the EA launcher is so trash"
i got this game cause it was £3 and honestly not worth £3 there was times in the game where i couldn't change my weapon and i couldn't shoot during battle so i couldn't complete any missions it happened in every mission i played if your looking for a good shooter game this isn't the game for u
"total crap

its full, really full of hackers => unplayable

the gaming itself is just ""empty"". there is nothing, only graphics.
there is also lag. 
many rifles are that weak.
when you shot someone from behind in his back and you get a lmg, or a asaultrifle, then he still can kill you because the spread stops you form making damage soon and he can turn and shot you with one of the few accurate guns."
There are times I cannot swap guns after a cinematic
-
"Had a really great time for the first 20 hours playing online, then you realize there's at least one hacker in every single official server. The bad news is, they won't fix it, just like with Battlefield 1."
EA sloppp
"Not that I'm expecting a lot from a 6 year old game by the company that disrespected 2042 so badly, but there is, without fail, at least 1 person cheating in every single match I've played. Usually more. Yikes"
"Hackers will find you, no matter where you try to camp or hide, gain a strategic advantage, this game isnt cared for, so you shouldnt care for it either. Fuck you EA. The OG BF community hates your ass."
TOO MANY CHEATERS
How is it allowed that EA launcher keeps running in the background even after you close the game. Steam is selling malware attached to its games now?
"Use to work on Linux, no longer. Why? Some anti-cheat EA blames on an operating system. Please spare me."
Honestly not a great game. get battlebit or hell let loose instead :/
they broke it for steam deck
It’s too infested with cheaters not worth it at all
CAN I LAUNCH MY FUCKING GAME????? WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH THE LAUNCHER??
too many hackers
"Played few times from different gamepasses now could not retun when i bought from sale, now its just full waiting to get shot thru 3 bushes and never lifted up..."
"$3.49 and the game constantly crashes on startup...,

 the furthest i was able to get to was the brightness screen that showed a black box at 100% brightness, then crashed the final time i was willing to put up with.  

DUMPSTER FIRE"
Game is $3.49. Literal pocket change. Still wont buy it.
not good
doesnt work
"Wouldn't even launch, tried a dozen fixes nothing."
In terms of historical accuracy this game is so far removed from reality that it's best described as a work of fiction
worst game iv ever played.
"This game is the worst. Well all ea games mostly suck, horribly. 

At first glance I saw this game and thought to myself: ""This is gonna be so cool! A good looking cinematic game with a decent fps shooter. And it has a multiplayer!?"" 
That was the wretched fool I was. Believing that, an ea game, would be good. Honorable garbage. Distinctly, one of the worst game's I've ever laid my cursor on. Unfortunate. 
To anyone reading. Don't waste your time, money, effort, and, soul into an ea game.
It's the same hot steaming pile of garbage every time. Like activision, truly, the worst. 
Let's break it down as to why ea sucks horse genitals. 
Reason One: Ea refuses to ever actually make a good fucking anti cheat, capable of doing it's damn job. Like activison, too. Great job, following in the footsteps of failure, ea :0
Reason Two: As reference to Reason One; Hackers. Hackers are in every Multiplayer game you join. Another ea L.
Reason Three: SO MUCH LAG THAT IT IS UNBEARABLE. Holy. Hot. Steaming. HELL. There is so much lag for a high end PC. Why? Why you might ask? Because. EA CAN'T MAKE A FUCKING GAME USABLE. 
Recurring Thoughts Here.
Why did I waste my money on an ea game, thinking that it would be good :( 
How come my decent PC can't run this game... ON THE LOWEST. SETTINGS. 
How come I can max out Minecraft, Java Edition, on full settings, and get around quite literally: thousands of more FPS.
""I updated my drivers, I should be able to run this game wonderfully on a nice RTX 3060!"" HELL FUCKING NO. 
Moral of this goofy ass story. Don't waste your time with ea, thinking that, oh hey, I'll have a good time. Because No. No you fucking won't. Ever.

Unfortunate Regards~ The Dumbass Who Bought An EA Game.
Have a good day."
The game crashes on startup banner. Tried every fixes available on internet nothing helped.
Nothing says WWII like electronic sights and suppressors. This is just a game set in modern times with WWII skins.
hackers are constantly DICK riding
"Nobody plays, dead servers, and hacker issue."
"You are literally given every weapon in the game off the start, you cant 'opt' out of that. Its the only version of the game you can buy on Steam.

Be aware of that when you buy, there is literally 0 progression for you to do."
"servers are non existent, dont bother getting it"
This game is so bad like it tried to be as fun like battlefield 1 but they really did try just go and play battlefield
"same as another battlefield game, no longer getting new update from the dev, VERY BORING :("
"It's fine for £3.50 on sale, but I wish I could skip the Nazi campaign, for obvious reasons.

Hmm. The game quit out twice in two attempts to get back into the campaign. By the way: why is the campaign practically hidden on a screen full of multiplayer modes?

I may as well get my money back. Sorry EA, I don't know what I was thinking."
"Purchased during steam sale for less than a cup of coffee, wish I would have gotten coffee."
"trash game,The server can't connect at all,Bastard EA"
maps are good but the weapons are shit
"this SUCKS!! I cant even play it with out having to fix the game files my self and even then it wont start up, Iv uninstalled this twice now and it still wont start the right way, a game of this size  made by EA it should have no issue starting up"
"I really tried to like this game, but it really isn't fun for a new player. 
The guns don't feel unique, every class has like 10/20 guns only for themselves to choose from, but they feel almost identical and have extreme recoil. 
There are 2 types of maps, 1. the urban ones, which are OK, but boring to play on. 2. And the plain ones, such as half of the Pacific maps. The plain maps are full of snipers, which makes it extremely hard to advance forward. You have no other choose to either pick sniper as well, or get in a tank or some other vehicle, which if you know how is really easy to counter.
The maps aren't beautiful and interesting as the ones in Battlefield 1. 
The Game is arcadey so don't expect realism, prepare for tanks reloading for 2 seconds driving in 70+kmph, even the heavy ones. 
Battlefield V could't exactly be called WWII game. It only has maps and modes on The Pacific, Western Europe and little bit of Northern Africa. There's no WWII without USSR. So many missed opportunities to add Eastern Europe battles, which we're the biggest in WWII. Imagine how great it would've been if there was Battle of Stalingrad? Battle of Kursk? Legendary battles for sure! But no, DICE decided that Solomon Islands we're more important, even Greece? Another Major Nation that is missing is Italy and China. These would've been incredible campaigns to be added. 
I could go on and on but it really isn't worth of my time explaining how much I didn't like that game.
+EA Launcher fcking sucks.
Battlefield 1 and Battlefront 2 are way better that this, buy them instead."
Trash game! Cant shoot anything.
"Client problem. Tried everything, even reinstalling the game or reinstalling the EA client, it still won't show the friend list in the game. You can't interact with the client, can't invite friends, and it's very lagging... This has been happening for some years and somehow EA still hasn't got it fixed."
"Ddim BF1, a hynny yw ddrwg. Mae'n ddiflas."
Absolutely riddled with aim-botters and wall-hackers.  Do not waste your valuable time or money on this trash.
fix anticheat
"Battlefield 1 is better than this with Operations; with this game, you will be lucky even to have fun if you get into a halfway decent map, but if you get into a lobby with some of the most brain-dead teammates you will ever see good luck some people will run right past you and not pick you up even when no one is around them for miles. Tanks are an abomination in this game. They will camp away from everything in the open so they don't get surprised by anyone, which hinders the game. Snipers in this game are awful unless you are good at head shooting like some people claim they are. If you are right on someone and shoot them in the upper chest/neck region, you will get the utmost 80 damage, which then you have to switch to your pistol; by the time you do that, you will be dead from an assault class. 

The worst of them all is the brightness/darkness of the game. You can't see anything in this game without straining your eyes.

All in all, buy BF1 and have a better time with recon, assault, support, or medic. With the amount of people on BF1, though, you will only get four maps, but those four maps are amazing to play."
"Cheating problem is insane if you don't play on community servers, no dedicated servers with plugins and auto moderation, development basically cut in the middle of fixing the game, feels nothing like battlefield. Overall a 6/10 game, but if you want a battlefield experience just skip it and buy 3/4/1."
"This game sucks major ass, can't even call people a nigger in text chat. Still came while playing 0/11 stars"
Doesn't work even with recommended computer specs.
wont launch
"EA send the FBI to me and i told them to GTFO or be killed.
You americans think you can rule the world through games now, well i have a message for you : FUCK YOUR RACE AND YOUR FASCISTS JEW ASSFUCKING INBRED ATTITUDE !
EA = MOSSAD !!!"
"EA sucks, just got a 49"" monitor and was stoked to play bfv on it. And now the game won't even freaking launch. I'm kind of new to pc so maybe there's a way to fix it, but the fact that you have to do all this b.s just to play the game really kills it for me. EA SUCKS!"
Where the fuck is the eastern front! All this WWII games with just axis vs allies should be 50% off by default since they are lacking AT LEAST half of the conflict.  That said tank battles can be entertaining.
"Not a good game, don't buy."
Enjoying the game but these hackers are just ruining it. EA improve your stupid ANTI-HACKING SYSTEM
maps barely had airplanes!!!! UGH
"I kinda like this game, there were already a lot of cheaters, they actually updated the game with a new anti cheat, which broke Linux support, but there are still a lot of cheater, numbers increasing :("
bf5's good but ea is so trash wtf
Steam Luncher has serious issues with lunching the game.
NO.I Don‘t like it.
go woke go broke
아니요
This game sucks
NOT REKOMENDED CHEATER IS EVERYWHERE
soo many cheater at asia server
"Dogshit multiplayer experience, unable to play with friends, custom squads, bad asf EA client taht constantly rendering pc/laptop not to boot the game"
idk how 30k people are playing this. Not even worth 4$ lmao
Don't buy this game if you have an AMD graphics card. You'll get an error to update the driver and even though you update the driver and do all kinds of other shit it still wont work. Fuck ea games.
"The game is broken 
Open the game
enter a lobby
get to the field
the game stops its self
goes for 6 times
uninstall the game 
go back to BF1"
"enter multiplayer
invisible cheater with 70 kills and 2 deaths
uninstall game
refund"
"This game is SIX years old and its STILL plagued by bugs. Finish a game? Nope, it'll DC as the match ends. Land that shot? Nope, servers are made from potatoes. Got the jump on an enemy? Nope, they have wall hack and auto aim.

I paid $4.50 for this and I'm still disappointed. Can we please remove EA from the ""AAA"" list."
垃圾ea，不建议入手任何ea游戏。新手小白刚买的游戏就被封，打折多少都不能买，纯纯浪费钱影响心情。CTM
Fu*k EA and Fu*k EA launcher
Not even worth it for the single player part of it
"CHEATER EVERYWHERE.... YEP THEY TYPE A PERSON WHO CAN'T AIM PROPERLY AND JUST SMASHING THAT MOUSE/CONSOLE


DON'T BOTHER TO SPEND OR BUY THIS SH!T EVEN IF ITS $0.01"
This game sucked hard. Bad software. Crap controls. Lop sided match making. Poor pop counts. Crappy crappy guns... it took to much of my life to install the software for this.
15 minute unskippable cutscene before you even get to the main menu
"This is simply not WW2. The wehrmacht nor the allied forces had 70% women employed on the frontlines. The game is fun, but the immersion is terrible. It feels like an alt history take on WW2."
"Servers full of hackers, and no way to play with bots besides story mode unlike older Battlefield games. Idk why they can't just let those of us that wish to play offline do so, clearly the bots exist.... Refunded, and it was only 3 dollars, not even worth that imo."
Cheaters paradise...
stuttering on all low settings with a threadripper and 3090ti
"Terrible server support. Garbage game design.
 I can barely post this ssit review. Avoid this  BS"
"Was told this game is great, and it turned out that hackers are everywhere"
dogshit
"the game itself is a masterpiece, a lot of great game  modes... but u play online so most games u play got a ton of cheaters using engineer class.. killing everyone with his LMG got no chance to even enjoy multiplayer modes... u will only drop dead most of the time.... i even repported 1 player and next day i see that fcker again... seems like anti cheat isnt  working at all"
"For 3.50 EUR (my regional price) it's worth it to boot up a few games and mess around.
But as a Battlefield game it's probably by far the worst one. The weapons feel terrible, they have no customisation or attachments. Everyone is using the same two weapons for each class.
The conquest maps are all horrible. It's either open fields or chokepoints only.
Tanks completely dominate every lobby. Think you can sneak up to it and kill it? Spawning as assault you have 2 Rockets, 2 C4 (dynamite) and you can choose an Anti-Tank bundle grenade. If you connect all 5 of those, you barely do 100 damage. And tanks have an instaheal button, so they have about 140 ehp.
So far in 20 hours I've seen about 5 hard cheaters (LMG headshotting rage hack type shit), god knows how many more non-blatant ones.
There is literally no progression, pick what you want and play. All weapons have the same dozen ""perks"".

But fuck it dude, for 3.50 EUR grab it, play a weekend with the boys and never come back."
Yo this game F***en sucks what the hell did they do to this battlefield I was just playing single player and I couldn't even f***en shoot back how does AI cheat HAHA fire whoever made this game. I want my 3 funky a** dollars back. HAHA just madness. They should have just made it battlefield like the originals not a second rate COD game.
傻逼EA，垃圾一般的UI，加好友都加不了，有时Launcher都开不了白屏脑瘫玩意就他妈的惦记你那逼垃圾EA LAUNCHER吗用steam不好？开启游戏的速度跟史一般，玩你家游戏真的是事事不顺利
The multiplayer simply does not work. I tried connecting to a bunch of different servers for an hour straight to no effect. The rest of my time playing was me going through the campaign. It's dogs*it. Go play Battlefield 4.
"fully of campers. tanks are harder to kill, like even a damn PUMA takes panzerfaust like its a cheese."
The single player version is good but very short. Majority of the game is multiplayer online and sucks.
"Redirects you to the EA app instantly, spammes you with error code E:10000, triples your ping for no reason, dosent show friends and dosent allow you to turn off vsync which the game got the fps underlocked."
"EA sucks, no more linux support. DON't BUY ANY EA GAMES."
single player was ass
"DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY

Anti-cheat just causes the game to crash consistently. I can no longer play this game as a result."
the game does not run and has to click several times from steam. broken i guess. but once you entered the game itself is okay. the only issue is the game require internet and even if you only want to play single player game. it still hard to even run the game from steam. no wonder they discount the prize till low as hell. cause the program is not stable on steam
"I already owned this on the ea launcher but it was on sale. playing it again makes me realize this is just a badly executed ripoff of battlefield and cod mechanics. Please don't buy it, just buy bf1"
the player base of this game is dead the only game mode ever available is Conquest and even then if you want to play on NA servers for a ok ping you will be out of luck
worst battlefield game ever made
"Its not worth 1$ . Go give that 3,50 to a charity you loser ."
"O Hell Naw. If u love being constantly fought by players WAAAAAAAAAY out of your league that play this fucking shit. Fuck EA with a damn cactus, how the hell they manage to make a worse battlefield every fucking year that fucking talent. Avoid this shit at all cost. Matter of fact, avoid this shit like a damn debt collector."
"cant play because ea app

fuck you, you worthless fucks"
"Game won't launch whatever you do. I ve tried to find a fix but did not find anything that worked for me. Do NOT buy . In fact, Steam should remove this game from the store."
"battlefield 1 does everything better

gunplay, story etc

very buggy as well, optimization is awful (i hv a rtx 4060)"
"piece of shit game, i bought it 3 days ago and last 2 days i am constantly getting disconnected from servers 
""lost connection to ea servers""

i paid for this shit and i cant even play for 5 minutes straight, i want my money back"
"Just like those fake gameplays at E3.
The beginning started so well and interesting, though.
It feels like 95% of the game is just scripted garbage, like an interactive movie or something.
Got it only for single player, as i don't care about multiplayer, so my review is strictly related to that, i have no idea how it is online so i cannot comnent.

I am glad i bought it before the sale ended, so i won't buy the newer ones either.
Disappointing 'experience', i guess i will go back to BF Bad Company and maybe 3 whenever i feel like playing Battlefield.

It also has some heavy freezing/stuttering in cutscenes, and guess what, all the nazi stuff is pretty much censored, which, i find ironic.

It's very short and mostly filled with just cutscenes, it feels limited and very scripted. 

And people complained about the asset flips on Steam being low effort lol"
the ea app is one of the worst things to ever be created
"Game is awful, players in game are worse."
garbage
cannot open the game!
"This is not going to be a bad review because of EA. this is a negative review because the game just sucks. This feels like a cheap copy of bf 1 -all the good stuff. 

pros:
- good revive system 
- really smooth gameplay
- you can see if you are tagged

cons:
- every gun is already unlocked for you so there is very little procession (the most fun part of Battlefield)
- tanks can turn 360 degrees in 1 sec
- small tanks have way too much armor
- gun meta
- way worse graphics than bf1
- animations in solo missions are really really bad 
- the first solo mission when you play for the first time is just a worse version of the bf1 mission
- very little immersion
- planes are less fun
- 50% off some maps are just vehicles
- healing yourself is weird 
- you can spawn on squad mates even if there is a enemy next to him 

These are things I immediately noticed within 1 hour, it is clearly a cash grab form the hype of bf1 
it feels like a shitty arcade version of bf1 so it is very surprising that it even has positive reviews. How is this made by the same studio as bf 3,4 and 1?"
"garbage, I have never been more infuriated by a game it's f##king dogsh#t"
"cant fucxing open the game, like wtf EA?!?!?!?!"
"Apparently EA discriminates against handicap gamers. I am a one-handed gamer, sort of. I only have a thumb on my left hand so keyboard and mouse games are not possible for me to play unless I use reSWAD to map keyboard and mouse functions to my controller. Which I do for several games that do not have any controller support. However, reSWAD is OFF, it is NOT running in the background yet Battlefield V refuses to start up stating it cannot run at the same time as reSWAD... IT IS NOT RUNNING! IT IS OFF! I bought this game to play the one player campaign but EA apparently hates gamers with legitimate handicaps. I should not have to uninstall a necessary program every time I want to play a one player game that I paid for the rights to play. 
I'd love to review this game but all I can say is shame on you EA."
"EA retroactively added their new anti-cheat to this title, making a once playable game [b]fundamentally broken on Linux systems, Steam Deck included.[/b] I really appreciate when purchased games become made unplayable on entire systems years after release.

If you have this on Windows, treat this review as cautiously recommended. It's a fantastic entry in the series imo but I've heard a lot of talk about the new anti-cheat being ineffective and problematic for Windows players too."
Unplayable due to  large amount of hackers
"the game is ok, but it is buggy and will rarely even open without going through some series of opening and closing apps and/or restarting the PC."
"Recon class: The snipers of the game supposed to provide long range support from cover.
Every optic for Recon class rifles has stupid amounts of glint so everyone sees you across the map, so cover at any range is pointless. 

Other classes are okayish, Hell Let Loose is ten times better. I do not recommend Battlefield 5"
crap
having come from bf3 i'm kinda shocked how little difference there is overall. Honestly just gonna go back and maybe get my $3.50 back.
"it's feels like you're playing a free to play version of call of duty in a bad engine. it's an alright game, but there's a lot of small issues that are annoying. I paid 4 quid for it so it's not too jarring, paying £60 for this would be a mistake."
game servers are riddled with wallhackers/cheaters... no fun at all.
"Frequently crashes with no reason, game just closes itself down and then so does the EA launcher. 

EA are the worst company."
"Could be so much more but it is just not worth three euros.

The mp I did not test since BF V is known as one of the most cheaters infested games. The SP ... only one campaign was actually worth it and that is just almost an hour of gameplay. The rest was bad. Like really awful. You never felt like you were at war. It was badly scripted. I could hear people screaming and charging but there were no AI allies around. I took a whole german HQ by myself. You had to destroy a gun emplacement, you placed TNT but your allies would not move so they blew up along with the gun. The AI had no fear of death. They would just charge against machine guns without a care in the world. Your character would just start talking in french and so you had to read the translation while in front of a bunker shooting at you. Why not say it while in a trench. Once there was a flame thrower chasing one of your guys. Like two idiots running around. It was just so bad. BF 1 was way better. Gladly this game only lasted 4 to 5 hours from which 1 was good. Like why would the other guy start signing while they were charging against us. How did the navy find us. The planes. From where did they come from. Where did the hostage find TNT. The other female character survived a 50 meters fall on rocks. You could freeze to death but the enemy was not affected. Why did closing the generator make it explode. The stories made no sense. Low IQ individuals like whaaaaat???

Very bad. Just avoid!"
I cant even remember the last time EA didnt ruin one of their products.
Cheaters with 100-0 KDA :) Might as well not have anti-cheat at this point.
Way to ruin another game EA. And **** Windows!
"Can't run on Linux/Steamdeck because Dice decided to add EA Anti Cheat 6 years after the game launched.

But to be more specific about the game itself, as I've tried it on Windows, I feel it doesn't have a distinct identity like Battlefield 1 had. The UI and HUD feel and work like a shooter in a modern setting, however this game tries to be WW2 game, which doesn't come across. I like some new additions like the cover you can build, but overall this game feels like a WW2 reskin of a modern shooter.

If you are longing for something thematic and cinematic, give BF1 a try! My favourite Battlefield so far, and I feel Dice had an actual vision for that title."
I do understand that at the time of my review that me game time was 42 minutes. However for 30 of the 42 minutes I was in que to join a game that is apparently not active.
"This game would be fine if the required EA launcher could actually work. I've tried for the past half an hour to get this game to run and nothing works. Don't buy this game unless you want to be met with a company that can't even bother to make the launcher (that they require) work

EDIT: Disabling OneDrive sync seems to fix the issue, but no other game in my steam library has this problem"
"EA is trash. no support to help on account. 
refunding and never buying again an EA game"
"Jesus fucking christ, attacking? Nothing but snipers lining the hills with unerring aim, impossible to push. Defending? Assault units with laser beam guns, can't defend against a hail of bullets. That's the 2 meta play styles I picked up from 1 hour. Going from BF1 to this (not just the whole oh new tech new style of fighting) is dog shit. BF1 has that feel of WW1 anyone can die no matter the weapons, any gun is usable, so why in bf5 am I fighting cod player movement"
This game is contain a lot of cheaters and hackers.
We shouldn't have to watch your cinematics. You have to make these cinematics passable.
"Waste of time and my three bucks. Game is infested with cheaters who run and gun with K/D 80-5 (don't even try to justify that with mythical skills gained by drinking unicorn's piss), If you happen to find clean game you have to deal with one hit shotguns (on top of already ridiculous TTK in general) and people prone in corners, waiting and camping because visibility is horrible. So much fun, no wonder this franchise is dying... which is also apparent by just handful of available servers."
"[h1]WOMEN BELONG IN THE KITCHEN [/h1]

Feminist piece of trash, go subscribe to Undead Chronic!"
A good game but ruined by having to have to EA launcher. 1/10 just bc of that.
the game itself is bad but the launcher sucks
"Nah i rather play Battlefield 1
Also in every Lobby I go when i get 1 lucky kill i get called a hacker..."
"This is the worst game i´ve ever playered!!! The Multiplayer: You spawn, you are already dead (Snipers in the last corner of the map). I got a plane, I spawned with it and got shot by a rocket launcher in under one second. Everyone writes in the chat: Hackers! (or) cheater map if their team lost... Ass mode!!! 

The game has good graphics but the story mode isn´t worth it...

The game isn´t worth it, even if it´s on sale!!! I play rather the new battlefield 1 and this game doesn´t even works sometimes..."
"Can't even start the game it crashes on startup,insane game devs this shit is just a money grab"
"full of hackers or cheater, can shoot through wall, see behind the wall, headshot thing, ngl this game is fun and i dont mind get killed in the game with people that use their skill. not with third party cheaters and spamming in chat so we can chat at all. so dev if u keep those cheaters i would like to say goodbye for all of your games"
"NO RED ARMY IN THE GAME
ZERO OUT OF 10"
to many hackers
i would have gave it 5 stars if they had anti hack support but you don't and as a result hackers are out of control and have ruined the game play. If you sell this game currently i think you owe the customers anti hack support or even a kick feature would be nice.
Can't maintain a connection to the EA servers for more than 3-4 minutes before getting disconnected. Seems like some issue with the EA malware-grade anti cheat system but I can't be asked to troubleshoot it. It's 2024 I should be able to install a new game and it just work. Ridiculous.
What a lazy downgrade from 1
"Game still wont launch a year later, refunded because they cant fix their shit"
"Best game ever, switches you to the losing team right on the verge of winning"
"game constantly crashes in the middle of a match, what a waste of time"
"A mediocre movie plot within the campaigns, somewhat strange historical settings, guns with modern add-ins, and multiplayer littered with ye olde cheaters. Worth of the whole 3 euros, for sure."
error 115 is horseshit and no help via online tech support fuck this game
"""Battlefield V,"" developed by DICE, is a first-person shooter set during World War II. The game offers large-scale multiplayer battles with a focus on squad-based gameplay and historically inspired environments.

While ""Battlefield V"" boasts impressive graphics and sound design, providing an immersive war experience, the game suffers from several issues. The skill gap can be daunting for new players, and the presence of cheaters can significantly disrupt gameplay. Additionally, the complex and often chaotic environments can make navigation and situational awareness challenging.

Pros:

-Impressive graphics and sound design.
-Large-scale, immersive multiplayer battles.
-Variety of historically inspired maps and modes.

Cons:

-Significant skill gap can be frustrating for new players.
-Cheaters negatively impact the gameplay experience.
-Confusing and chaotic environments.
-Some balancing issues.

Overall, ""Battlefield V"" offers an immersive and visually stunning war experience, but the steep skill gap, prevalence of cheaters, and confusing environments may detract from the overall enjoyment. 6/10"
I CANT PLAY THIS SHIT KEEPS CRASHING IT WONT LAUNCH. I HAVE LIKE 10 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY WHICH IS TRYING TO FIX WHATS WRONG WITH THIS GAME.
EA Sucks balls.
"Historically inaccurate. Nobody communicates. Nobody defends. Spawn points are fixed, not movable like hell let loose. Takes a LOT of shots to kill someone."
FUCK YOU EAAPP
it let me play a few months ago and now it saying i need to update my drivers and they are up to date shit fucking game
"I thought I'd pick this up because it was 93% off and seemed like a steal, but the only thing stolen was the hour of my life I wasted on this game. Now, obviously a 5+ year old BF game isn't going to have a huge playerbase, but I thought the solo content might be fun. After nearly half an hour just getting the game to run at an appropriate resolution, I was met with the dullest FPS experience in recent memory. Movement and gunplay feel sluggish and stiff.  It seems like EA tried to pad the runtime by filling short, linear solo levels with a bunch of collectibles. It's just garbage.

For perspective, I paid $3.49 for this game and still refunded it, so that should give you an idea of how bad the game is. If you're reading this, there are much better games to spend your money on. I don't think I could play this if I got it for free."
"Remember when game developers cared about historical accuracy at least a little bit? What ever happened to that? Now it's just about appeasing the people who will never play the games but will whine if they didn't stick a woman in a place where she wouldn't be historically, or sticking a bisexual furry Asian guy in the US Army. It just didn't happen. Sorry"
Just not good👎
"Game suck the movement is dumb the gun recoil sucks, do not recomend this game"
campaign was dook so i tried an online match and got aimbotted the whole time
They just broke this game for all linux users with the new anti cheat. Thumbs down for me
This is a good BF game.You will enjoy it especially when you play with your friends.But you cant play it whenever you want!!! The game doeant launch most of the times! So I give it 2 of 5
Its just not that fun
You know the game sucks when you're on the fence about whether or not you wasted your money after getting it on sale for $3.50
EA
Unplayable due to the EA launcher
NO AMERICAN SERVERS
Botlefield V
"Unknown account ban, no supports, don't buy"
Unlaunchable on Steam. To play this you have to get it on the EA APP only it seems. Running into far too many problems than it's worth trying to run this. The game itself is fun despite the massive historic inaccuracy. Not even gonna request a refund since I got this for only $3.49 during the 2024 Steam Summersale.
Probably the most toxic community I've witnessed.
nope
"Too many cheaters in multiplayer.

The singleplayer campaign is not fun enough."
"they added anti cheat, it did reduce cheating. however, it only reduced it"
"Seems like you haven't unlocked positive review yet, pay additional 29.99$ to unlock positive review and enjoy additional perks, or buy the monthly pass for only 5.99$!"
"Since it’s been on sale four times in a row, every server has been swarmed by the absolute lowest tier of existence. These aren’t players—they’re parasitic, basement-dwelling degenerates with no life, no friends, no future, and no purpose other than to infest games like the human equivalent of malware.

No self-respect. No dignity. No concept of fun or fairness. Just lifeless nobodies who couldn’t achieve anything real if their lives depended on it. They’ve got no goals, no dreams, no motivation, no skills, no talent, and not a single redeeming quality. Their entire personality boils down to cheating because it’s the only way they’ll ever feel like they’ve ""won"" at something. But even then? No one cares.

These bottom-feeders exist in the darkest corners of their mom’s basement, feeding off stale Hot Pockets and internet validation. No courage to face a real challenge, no integrity, no honor. Just pathetic cowards with no ambition, no relationships, no legacy—nothing but a long, sad future of failure and irrelevance.

If they ever saw sunlight, they’d burst into flames. If they tried to play fair, they’d uninstall in shame after five minutes. There’s no hope for them. No redemption. Just a hollow existence fueled by ruining other people’s experiences.

Cheaters: the purest form of human failure."
"Fuck EA
Making me re-buy games
Shitters"
The game would not even start spent an hour trying to fix issue it kept complaining about my drivers but Titanfall2 and all my other games work just fine. Do not waste your time or money
This game is not what Bf should be
"Why there is no USSR?
few EU servers, always full of campers"
"Hope you like dieing every 10 seconds, online games are full of cheaters.  Ruined a potentially great game."
made my dick hurt
EA app and EA Launcher are SHIT AF ... Please Delete YOUR Launcher Electronic Farts . thanks
EA
"I have been playing this game on console and it was very fun!!. But when i played it on PC, there is a lot of players cheating and hacking, especially in Asian servers. I was hoping to get the similar experience i played on console but instead all i got is a bunch of cheating players. What happened to EA? Are they understaffed and can't monitor the older products they have released?? BFV is still a demanding game IMO and they should keep monitoring it to keep out those cheaters out there. As for the cheaters, mate you just suck real bad, i bet your kd ratio without cheats is 0.1, that's why you use the easy way out. Disgusting..."
进去就是卖挂的在刷屏wtf
Bought this on sale for the campaign alone. Wasn't worth it.
not a fan
"This game is overall good, and I would've recommended this game, but I have one complain that is just unforgivable and I am sure I am not alone on.
The EA app is very bad, most of the time it logs me out and doesnt even let me log in showing some error.
I also cannot launch Battlefield V (not sure if its because of the app) because my anti virus flags it or some stupid bullshit like that. For this reason, I cannot recommend this game."
so many cheater and hard to report them in game. Bad UI also
"Game is good, but is full of cheaters, most of the time teams are highly unbalanced, and then there is chat spamming (really annoying, forget texting in game). And it feels like EA don't care. Wish I had known this before buying the game."
"Broken servers and EA app.
So many cheaters, The Anti cheat is not working."
women
어제는 재밌게 했는데 오늘은 실행 자체가 안되네요 무반응이예요
"This is the worst fucking battlefield game that i have ever played, and besides Hardline, I played all of them.

Campaign is one huge shitty terrible joke that should be avoided by all players at all cost. The fact that this game was advertised as realistic WW2 experience is a kick in the balls of every WW2 soldier that fought on the frontlines. You want to play as strong independent woman that single handedly takes down half of the German Army? First, there is something wrong with your head, but you can play as her in this excuse of a campaign. There is nothing enjoyable about BFV stories, its like those open combat missions in MW3 2023. Same shitty idea, same problems.

As for the multiplayer, this is where the downtrend with BF multiplayer began. Weapons have almost no recoil whatsoever, so the only important stat that you need to look out for is the amount of damage that the weapon does. Do you remember that fire spread from all previous battlefield games? That system where the more you fired, the less accurate the weapon would be? Well, its gone now. Hitboxes are downright broken on some bodyparts. For example, I sneaked up on the enemy and shot him in his toe like 10 times, but nothing happened, so he quickly turned and ripped me into shreds. Next time enemy opens fire at me, I quickly hid behind a rock and that same person kills me with a headshot.  Weapons are unbalanced as fuck. Some of them shoot nerf darts, some of them shoot tank shells. Seriously. There are weapons that identify as an Assault Rifle, yet they do less damage then Submachine guns. Historical accuracy is non-existent even with weapons.

Most of the maps suck ass. There are either to big to travel on foot, empty or their design is just terrible. And because of the fucking operator and skin system you cannot identify a friend from a foe. 


This game not only pissed me off, but gave me a seisure as well and made me physicaly sick
Absolutely do not recommend to anyone aside from those cunts that still buy new yearly-cycle games every time. Those idiots consume every shitty AAA game these days."
"The game looks amazing BUTT, gameplay is ASS. So many things wrong like hackers, saving settings is an issue, opening the game just to restart intro EVERY SINGLE TIME. They say triple A, but its TRIPLE ASS. BAD. Even though I got this for 5 bucks, I felt ripped off."
linux gamers cant play this game bc of kernel level anticheat fuck ea
meh
screw EA WORSE PUBLISHER EVER CANT EVEN KEEP A GAME GOING FOR ANYTHING
"Tons of cheaters, dont buy it"
Cheaterfield 5
"This is a good game, what is not good is that the EA launch has to exist. It won't launch my games half the time and this problem has been been continual.

I recommend the game but no the launcher or EA for that matter."
Worse game ever
"this game probably has the most UNPLAYABLE campaign i have ever seen.
EVRYTHING is broken, enemy detection system, their hitboxes, weapons sometimes freezing entirely not letting you reload or to USE THEM AT ALL.
Awful"
sswssss
"they really gotta lower the amount of hackers per game, I've been getting at LEAST 3 each game, of them shooting through walls, flying and not being able to  die. please fix this issue"
too many hackers
This can be a great game but there are so may cheaters playing that it sucks all the fun from the game.
"(Mostly) Good Singleplayer campaigns, but primarily sweats in the multiplayer, not great for beginners."
"tai anticheat nya malah gabisa maen, eror anticheat nya"
Cutscenes were laggy and the gameplay was overall very clunky even just for 30 minutes of gameplay

not working keeps kicking me out of the servers
"the singleplayer campaign is good. the multiplayer? the multiplayer mode is made for hackers, on every server there is always a hackers. and the best part is, the dev does not give a f*ck about this problem, so yeah f*ck the multiplayer mode, i'm uninstall the game after i finish the campaign."
not played for a while and now won't even start. Installed anti cheat as required. Waste of money.
"EA constantly ruining their games, playerbase dropped ever since the last update. Also you can still exploit, so their anticheat solved nothing but crash normal players on the game.

And they broke it for linux users too..."
"si no te mata un hacker el clan stacking te quitara fuerza de vida

added new anticheat that breaks linux compatibility 5.5 years after the release. you cant even play singleplayer anymore. and looking at the reviews it didnt help anyone.

"Recommended for SP.  

Wish they added possibility to play the MP maps in PVE.

Like most of games with PVP, there is no fun in getting on servers with cheaters ... so the multiplayer section of this game i can not recommend.  No fun in there!"
stupid game where you are playing against a team of 10k hour players.
I just wanna leave a negative review to all Battlefields after Battlefield 4
"WOKE everywhere, black nazi, women fight XD I paid 5 euro it isn't worth it. Battlefield 1 >>>>>>>> Batlefield V

YIKES EA WHAT DID YOU LEAVE US WITH
"TOO MANY CHEATERS, SNIPERS ARE UNUSABLE, YOU ARE BASICALLY A BIG SPOTLIGHT THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE WHEN U USE SCOPE"
Game is broken on Steam Deck after the anti-cheat update. Thank you EA for removing Linux support for no reason. Good to see its not doing anything about the hacking issues that are still making this game unplayable in almost every server. Please fix your shitty anti-cheat EA.
"Single player campaign (i don't know about coop) - Very primitive and lazy gameplay, every step taking damage of guns, need to replay, 1st person, only shooting in general - not realistic, not interesting. Short but nice 4 plot stories and graphics. I recommend easy difficulty if you want to buy it anyway and on a huge discount. In some missions you can use a plane or a jeep a little, and even skis. Freezes at the beginning of cutscenes. 
I always recommend buying games at a discount and, if possible, where you really buy it, and not rent while Steam exists or has not sent you to hell. Besides, there is no demo, you might not like the game, etc. And we play most games once, or not at all, why pay tens of dollars - nonsense. And if you play several times a week, you can get into debt within a month. Two hours of play or 14 days will pass and you won’t be able to return it. Plus, many games deceive the buyer, for example, on soulslike it says adventure or impossible to complete without paid modifications, on coop it doesn't say only coop in a franchise that had a single player campaign, or the game is just very boring hackwork with cool advertising or there is an agenda instead of a normal plot with normal characters, etc. The game is easy or well optimized for the first 2 hours, then problems start and you can't return the game. Reviews are bought by game companies. And you agree to some rules, a rule book, who reads that? When you buy food, do you also sign something? Food is even more serious. You write so much so that no one will notice that we have no rights to the goods we bought?! Creatures. Agreement to view some personal data, a microphone, etc., what is that? And if you don't agree, you can't play, it's violence. And how can we filter mixed content, block absolutely everything?? Make censored content, censored versions. So, this is not a kind store, but real thieves, you can’t be generous with them. Instead, they should be judged."
"this is my first ever review on game and this game beyond sht. no anticheat no optimization, spoiled company and EA app just weird than those genders... x.x"
"pathetic revisionist arcade ""ww2 themed"" borefest"
"First battlefield game got on sale and pretty disappointed.

Its got server issues, UI issues, cheaters, and a greedy in-game store, but besides it being an EA game its still got really fun gameplay. Its unfortunate to watch this game be held back by really small issues that could be fixed. idk why you would pay 60$ for any online game if they'll just forget about it and make a new one thats basically the same thing a few years later."
If you want to play against people who TTK (time to kill) you in .1 seconds with 100% accuracy because they have over 3000 hours on the game and probably another 10k hours on other fps games go ahead. Unless you are good at FPS games already you will not have a good time
Crappy campaign that is completely uninspired. I generally don't like playing sets of stories with no common thread. The forced stealth is abhorrent. No matter how good the multiplayer is the campaign should have effort put into it.
shit game :D battlefield 1 is better
just don't work after last update
faced Hacker every game. shit EA can't fix it
"THIS GAME IS STILL AS BAD AS IT WAS 2 YEARS AGO!! laggy, terrible bugs duiring gameplay and within the ""my company bs"" made the game for a woke audience and it shows lmao. ill give it to dice and EA, they did something no one else could: fuck up on a ww2 game lmao"
"Crap netcode and full of aimbot/esp users

Use the spectate feature and watch the top players"

"Need an anti-cheat system, too many hackers -_-
Game is good btw"
They retroactively removed linux support with their new EA anticheat
Bobo kayo tangna nyo
game keeps crashing every 5 minutes
Full of hackers
"Its still possible to enjoy this games content, it adds some good to the franchise but over all its a complete let down even after playing it this late after release. Medics in this game are completely overpowered and can spam heal over and over again while MGs are complete trash, supresion does nothing and you can't aim with the medium machine guns without using the bipod, making you a sitting duck. The worst about this game is the fact that you have to install EA adware to play it. Have fun seeing a small blue box with the words ""Downloading stuff"" when first trying to launch this game, if you're wondering what the hell ""stuff"" might be, feel free to ask the mutli-billion dollar company that made it. Once it's installed it starts everytime you start your computer. Honestly this shit made me stop playing after it locked me out of the game because I didn't remember my EA account password and I couldn't be bothered to go to their dumbass website because you can't reset your password on the popup."
The game no longer launches after EA got rid of the origins app
Just go back to Battlefield 1. Everything you want is there. This game provides none of it.
so many cheating and hacking on this game
ton of cheaters
Pile-o-shit
"The campaigns are still glitchy several years later, had my character get essentially sleep paralysis where i couldnt swap weapons, fire, throw grenades, or any action, could only walk around and look as i got shot to death, had to reset my game to fix it. 1/10. a game this old should not still be in this bad of shape. It has fun moments, but if they cant even get the basic movement and interactions correct, it doesnt bode well for this 6 year old game."
This is a Tutorial on HOW TO KILL A GAME by Electronic Arts.
totally unbalanced game. not fun.
https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/
EA cut steam deck support so I can no longer play it. Thanks for the stupid anticheat guys.
the amount of cheaters are insane. unplayable dont buy not worth the money.
"Fun game but the hackers suck the fun out of it and for that, I am giving it a dookie"
"I wanted to like this game. I love games based in historical settings, big battles too, but this just isn't scratching that itch. Several things, like the UI elements, the weapon attachments, the absolute historical inaccuracy and the campaign mission structure just feel like a plain old modern game, and that's boring. If we ignore that and simply look at the gameplay, the Singeplayer campaign is forgettable which is more or less the average Battlefield affair since 3. Multiplayer wise, it's a downgrade on the snappy gameplay of Battlefield 1. There are also some balancing issues, like for some reason everybody can heal teammates instead of just Medics, making the already annoying constantly getting back up even more annoying because EVERYBODY is getting back up EVERYWHERE. In other issues, I've heard there are several cheaters, but I'm unsure if I've met any. My main issue with multiplayer was finding an active game more than absolutely anything."
"If call of duty was battlefield, lazer guns, HALO SIGHTS LMAO.  Also it's made for campers, the maps, the foliage. If you play this instead BF1 then you should just play cod since both take equal amount of skill aka point and click. Also bf 2042 is better and 10$ on sale."
"Hackers everywhere still even after the anti cheat system has been put into play, not worth the time or money youll just get 1 tapped by lmg from across the map."
"Do not buy, it's dissipating spending your money on a game just for them to add anti cheat making the game unplayable, cheers ea"
"This is a review based on the multiplayer campaign, I refuse to play the story mode of this abomination.

The time that Battlefield catched up Call of Duty in how bad and random it feels has come. The multiplayer is extremely chaotic and there is no way to balance your experience with it. You get wrecked by tanks and airplanes? You play Assault and can't do anything, because the rocket launchers in this game don't deal damage. You want to wreck with a tank or plane? Suddenly the rocket launchers deal damage that one shots you. You get your butt scooped by one-shots from an Arisaka? Go and try it yourself and it doesn't do horse crap. It feels that every single move in this game skill checks you, but the curve to which you have to adapt and learn to understand when it's time to invoke the necessary skill to survive in the battle is non-existent. You get punished by even doing your role correctly. Do not give any money for this game, its whole existence is in shame for the Battlefield franchise, once better than CoD but now in a worse level than it. Seriously, go play CoD. They are asking the extra money because now, they know they are better."
Too many cheaters. EA cares more about the chat filter than the game
to much hacker

or Playing on Europe / North America, having 300ms ping and can't do any shit other than dying
Cheaterfield V key features :
- Getting shot (even behind the wall) from god who knows place.
- Your enemy have sandevistan or something idk and their movement is so fast you don't even know when they're coming.
- The ""obvious"" pro player on enemy team with fucking 2-3 digits kill and 0 death
- Bot spamming on chat saying god language (guess the country)  and getting censored by EA chat filter (the chat filter feature is better than their Anti-Cheat)
- The overwhelming tank and aircraft on enemy team who always fcking knew your position wherever you are on the map!"

"Meh. 
Purchase it on sale if you can."
terlalu banyak cheater
fuck ea they broke the game on linux due to the new anti cheat
"Haven't played in forever
Game updated anti-cheat to break on Linux/Steam Deck months ago, and it didn't fix hackers in the game from my research, can't even play campagin, EA once again proving its the worst company ever."
mybe im noob but i dont know how to start story singleplayer mode
"TOO MANY HACKERS, AND NEED ALOT OF BANDWIDTH TO PLAY"
Planes are too OP compared to previous games.
Impressively unfun for a battlefield game.
not working on steamdeck
"Not really very fun. I only care for building barricades because it reminds me of playing CoD Zombies, which is a far more enjoyable experience. After playing a couple more hours, I can confirm that the game is absolute dogwater with rampant cheating. We're talking some guy on the opposite side of the map spraying randomly with an SMG and one shot headshotting everyone in his cone of vision. This game also censors you as much as possible. You cannot say ""Nazi"" in this WW2 game, nor can you say ""this game sucks"" without your message being blocked. Play something else.

Even without the cheating and censorship, the guns suck, the time to kill is wack, and having to pick up medkits and ammo every time you spawn is cumbersome. I play as a support player with ammo packs and as soon as the round starts, I have to spam ammo packs so my team can start the match with a decent amount of ammo. It's ridiculous and totally rips you out of your immersion. Generally, I avoid the combat entirely in this shooter game because making sandbag forts and digging trenches is a lot more fun than getting laser'd to death in the blink of an eye. Also, there's somehow very few enjoyable weapons in this game? Not sure how they managed that but I felt like I was done with progression only a few hours in because most guns aren't super recognizable or cool looking. And there's only a handful of bolt-action sniper rifles in the game for some reason??? You'd be surprised by how hard it is to come across a bolt-action rifle in this WW2 game, actually. Even worse, most of them have really bad damage output. Regularly, I had to 3-shot someone with my sniper because they just wouldn't go down. There is very little purpose in playing as a sniper. Very few LMGs as well."
Hackers. So much hackers that you can't enjoy the game. And EA isn't doing anything to stop it.
"a bAdmin banned me cus i was hitting headshots with a sniper. what was i supposed to do, aim for legs?"
ea play will not send verification so that you can connect the game ive been waiting a week for my email code from them so i can play this game and nope nothing ive had this problem before to with other games sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt
"Infested with hackers and edgy people, very disappointed with this game."
Just dont. BF has been over its top and has been going downhill steadily. This game is no exception. There are other games out there that do this alot better.
dgoshit game
"laggy mess, gameplay is fun, developers are lazy and cant even manage to load in simple stuff like skins which you can purchase with real fucking money, but first things first you have to install ea's shitty fucking launcher which nobody wants"
"All of the BS apps, and accounts need to play a mid game is ridiculous, EA account, origin sign in, EA anti cheat, EA/origin App. Never buying EA games again and uninstalling."
"Cheaters Cheaters Cheaters.... whats the point of a such an Anticheat, when absolutely every third player is a cheater... can't recommend."
"Pile of trash. EA is such garbage company. can't even login and play the game.
keep getting""Sorry, we've encountered an error.
Please try again in a few minutes."" 
I only wanted to play campaign"
Every Lobby I can see 3 to 4 cheaters running fast like rockets with aimbots and the worst thing is the bullets can pass through walls and land so you will die even if you do your best to hide behind things. Not Recommended
Second worst game I've ever played
Anti cheat doesn't work at all. Frequent disconnections.
"There are way to many hackers in this game for me to recommend it. It has had the most cheaters out of all the bf I have played. And I mean like aimbotting lmg for everybody to see and spamming the n word and so on.
But in rarer cases you also get cheaters in vehicles which is also a great time :I 
Anyway I would skip this game, It might not be bad in concept but if you wana play the multiplayer you should consider a different one."
"They bricked their game for linux users, thanks EA, go fuck yourselves"
I can't even open the game I bought after the anti-cheat update.
"Game doesn't even launch anymore. Asking me to install EA anticheat which i already have and continues to validate.After validation it just closes and does nothing about it. Trying to launch it again will have the same outcome. I unistalled and re-installed it twice and same thing happened. Checked a bunch of bugs about it online, nothing helped.
* If you are looking for a game that works , look somewhere else*"
AntiCheat Scumbags at EA Suck Windows Dick!
"Okay, I have no idea how these big companies can't get even basic settings right...I have a separate mic and right now am using a BT headset for audio. The game automatically picks up my BT headset as a mic, so I have no audio going to my headphones and my ACTUAL FUCKING MICROPHONE is not picked up. Ofc, there is also no manual setting in the game, for which mic to use.

This is a 5yo game, how the hell such a basic setting is not in the game?"
would be much better if u coild remove HDR
"Hello old friend lets play again, booted up after a long time.
Went in to multiplayer, we where winning the first 100 points, had fun!!!
Than the enemy started hacking (wallhack and aimbot), my team left the game and at the end we lost.
Uninstall the game again, goodbye my old friend!"
"All of the official servers are full of cheaters. EA needs to get out of their disgusting habit of dropping support for their games within 3 years of release if they want anything resembling a loyal fan base. I've played every Battlefield title except for Hardline since BC2. This is one of my favorites, but the cheaters make any official server unplayable. Bravo EA."
i dont like it that much
Dead Game with lots of Hackers you wont enjoy it and you will throw your money by buying this game really dont know how Steam allow such apps that the only possible way to play it is to have a hack software which is for sure a malware MY ADVICE DONT PLAY A GAME THAT REQUIRES HACK AND NEVER USE HACK
a mouse is in the middle of my screen when playing on controller
Its really hard to enjoy this game with all the hackers its a shame I can't recommend this.
eeeeee
"garbage game, lots of hackers"
Hack & cheating
this game can't run
"All of a sudden a kernel-level anti-cheat was introduced. No thanks. I'd get a refund if I could. The game was filled with cheaters after some time, but this is not the solution."
"Unplayable on my system because of the new anti-cheat. It is flat out incompatible with my system.

I'd honestly have preferred if they'd used EAC, BattlEye, and Denuvo simultaneously instead of this stupid anti-cheat from EA itself. I guess if people can't even play this game in good faith, then cheaters can't play it either.... But I'll be getting a refund."
"Sorry guys but BF 1 is much much better, no kids with spaming guns....
 If you are a sweet BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
AAA Shit
bad
The game is okay..
"bf 1 was better, too many bug on this shit"
I hate this game so much but it keeps dragging me in how do i fix this
"Worst fps game I've ever played, it has its good moments sometimes despite frustrating mechanics , but the overall experience in the story mode has been pretty bad and the online is dead. The story is stupid and pointless, the playability is boring and repetitive, but the worst of it all is the design of environment and gun funcionality. When an npc is behind a window frame or heavy machinegun he can't be killed for no reason even if you can see half his body, which makes no sense, edges of structures appear to end so I can snipe above them but the bullets stops as if its hittin a wall so the bullet trayectory doesnt match the environment, making sniping very frustrating and unrealistic. and  even worse, I constantly get to a place where all guns just stop working, can't use them or switch them and have to go back to the last checkpoint or reset the game to  fix it. I got it on 85% off so it's ok for the good graphics I guess, but it's totally not worth the full price. I wonder if my copy is just damaged or the game is actually this bad."
"Was pretty fun, then they added EA Anticheat. This did not fix the cheating issue and dropped support for the Steam Deck and Linux. My favourite part is the fact they did this years later."
Cheaterfield
so many hackers and their friends sucking them off trying to gas light you into thinking they aint hacking. thank you EA for pushing out a kernel level anti cheat that has done absolutely nothing but keep Linux players from being to play.
"Very irritating game. Most of the time one time is either being destroyed or you are completly dominating due to hackers. ""Redeployments"" happening most of the time due to reason whatsoever. Really annoyed with this game whilst I had highest of the hopes for it."
"actual goyslop,  battlefield has become so terrible."
"Dont waste your money. There's a lot of flaws that matter to some people but don't to others, but gamebreaking bugs like not being able to do anything but move randomly until you die are present and due to age, multiplayer is dead. Also the few alive lobbies i found had a hacker that made it unplayable"
84784
PvP has ton of hacks. PvE cant even work.
"Head shooting in every shot? 
Switches team mid-game?
1-man wipe the entire 32-man team?
360+ kills after 10+ mins game?

God damn this game has a lot of cheaters."
"expectations were very high, i am disappointed("
We would have lost the war if real soldiers were as stupid as the guys in the campaign
Scheiße
"If 2042 didnt exist, this would be the worst one"
"Yknow, after playying for a while...it's just not as fun as other earlier Battlefield titles. the TTK and balancing of both map design and equipment is less polished. The multiplayer playlists, how maps are categorised is poor. Personally, unsatisfying progression. The character customisation, at first seemed a cool addition but then, the pacific campaign is mostly neglected and pushes the cash shop.
Just not as fun. Maybe its just me, but nah. It's a shame.
Going back to Battlefield 1"
"Tbh, its bad game, Thought its something similar to H&G but its awful because every game as a cheater in it. No point to play such game."
"Where I don't care about Social Justice, I do care about Historical Accuracy, especially when it comes to a game that claims, that by playing you can ""Immerse yourself in the hard-fought battles of World War II"". In reality? That's all bullshit. Women weren't allowed to serve as frontline soldiers; they were ALLOWED to enlist, that's true, but their role was more as a support than a avarage soldier. Even the flag of the German Reich was changed to the flag of German Empire. The flag thingy I could understand since it's a mainstream game and the flag is banned in several countries,BUT they removed ANY mention of German Reich from the game. However historical accuracy isn't the main issue with the game. Game is full of cheaters, toxicity, bugged AI, boring and borderline shit campaigns, and a few game modes are dead. There's also absolutely no skill or balance in this game; the higher the fire rate of a weapon, the more kills you get. You can't win with high fire-rate weapons unless you have god like reflexes and aim. Game is also full of microtransactions, where you either grind to level up and do DAILY and MONTHLY missions to gain small amount of points to unlock cosmetics or you spend real money to unlock stuff. And also if you aren't in the loop, EA is a awful company. So yeah. I suggest you buy something else if you want an FPS set in World War II it's going to be 100 times better than this.

SO MANY CHEATERS
"7,49$ on sale for a broken game which crashesh"
"I don't recommend this game because it crashes mid game and i tried everything and its still wont work.
Fix your game."
always game disconnected. cant play multiplayer. suck game
"battlefield requires a special type of skill, and that is a skill i am lacking in.
also all the ""popular"" gamemodes have literally NO-ONE in them, so stop lying, they arent ""popular"""
You get killed by japanese women wielding katanas. Also there is no russian faction. The tanks are the only thing fun in this game and most maps you have to spam click on the icon just to be able to spawn in one. Overall seems like a very hastily put together game with zero care or respect for historical accuracy. Battlefield 1 is better.
"Only the Stories, I don't like online play:  Enemies are invulnerable standing behind an MG-42 on a tripod.  Whenever the game finally provides a sniper rifle, you only get 6 cartridges.  For some reason enemies that have flamethrowers also have super-bulletproof armor that did not exist in the 1940s.  HEADSHOTS DO NOT KILL IN ONE HIT.  The franchise is called BATTLEFIELD, not ONE PERSON WITH  ONLY A KNIFE TAKING ON THE ENTIRE GERMAN ARMY ALONE.  The stories railroad you through annoying low-visibility map zones, forcing you to sneak and execute espionage missions rather than fight in open large-scale battlefields in chaotic combat.  Also, these games no longer feature destructible ground and bullet trajectories determined by gravity.  Bad Company 2 is one of the best games I've ever played.  That game should have been the standard for all later franchise releases.  BC2 and the prologue of Battlefield 1.  BFV is not sniper/rifleman-friendly.  Also, every enemy aims at you, the player, only.  Developers should never sacrifice realism to make the game more OR less challenging.  There seems to be no single-player content for the Pacific theater, as I was misled to believe there would be by the videos and images on the Steam store page.  Fortunately I only paid $7.49 for this."
ugh!
"In my short time playing
Every single map I have played has massive stretches of open ground between most objectives
Weapons do back-flips in my arms whenever I try to shoot them
People eat more round than in any other Battlefield title I've played
Vehicles do not PTFO, they sit on hills with the snipers and snipe
Servers don't seem to support 128 players, 64 only, minus the snipers you maybe have 20 players a side"
"this thing is not good for new players, is your new to battlefield not get it i deleted it already"
"A HUGE NO. 
Bought this game on Steam but it also uses EA Play to open. Tried to get into few games, keeps disconnecting from online ""YOU HAVE LOST CONNECTION TO THE EA SERVERS""

 No wonder why is at price 7,49E.

Once again EA games doesn't stop to dissapoint people.  Just asked for a refund.."
"Hackers ALOT, terrible team balancing"
"THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!

I lied

Have some self respect and play Battlefield 1 instead."
"The game is solid, but hackers ruined the game for me.  1 in 3 matches I have run ins with hackers either on my team or the opposing team.  Not fun.  Imagine getting headshotted in a building under cover by someone clear on the other side of the map.  I've gotten headshotted while running through the subway map by players hiding in buildings, at their map starting location, on the surface, blocks away.  The hackers don't even hide what they are doing they just find a spot deep in their territory and rotate like a turret shooting everyone, everywhere.  

If they ever address the hacker problem in multiplayer, I'd recommend this game."
"bear witness to cheaters!
チーター、ご照覧あれい！
前有掛狗，敬請見證！"
"Big NO!!!! this game still full of cheaterssss!!!! no matter how strategic how you play it, you still can't outrun player with super speed, zero recoil, ultra long shot and map hack!!!! don't waste your time and money"
Still full of cheaters save your money.
looks worse and runs worse than battlefield 1. riddled with cheaters. a downgrade from battlefield 1.
I was able to finally able to connect with my grandpa. He started freaking out when he saw he run around with a shotgun.
yarrak gibi bir oyun sunucularda denge diye birşey yok şuana kadar oynadığım çok nadir olarak zevk aldığım anlar vardır. Sunucularda Denge yok Ya bir taraf çok güçlü ya bir taraf çok güçsüz. ya bir takımda 10 tane 150 lvl (full level) oyunu bilen kişiler var yada diğer takımda sadece 2 tane 150 lvl bazense 0 lvl insan var. yani denge diye birşey yok bok gibi
"I used to be able to launch the game, but now it just keeps crashing on launch. Tell me if you know how to fix this."
Soon we can enjoy ads while getting killed by hackers!
"Very boring, small maps, not a lot of maps, Operations is boring, tons of useless cosmetics that destroy the atmosphere of the game, dont buy this game."
infinite loading during the game. uninstalled.
"honestly still worse than 2042 which was also terrible. so many hackers, terrible TAA filter that makes everything blurry, abandoned by EA etc. just buy bf1 or bf4 instead"
"Help, i play with my friends in Combined Arms mode, but it's not working; after loading a few sec, my friend cancelling squad ??? How i can fix it ????"
"Bought this game because friends wanted to play.
Looks ok, but the gameplay is horrible.
There is no match making, so if you're not good, you'll just be insta killed all the time.
Wish i would've gotten a refund in time."
It was a good game but it's now unplayable because of the new anticheat.
"Battlefield 1 has better maps, servers, performance, graphics, and gameplay."
"Game is fun but completely broken by hackers. You will have to switch servers constantly because there are people who are aimbotting, speedhacking, respawning the whole server constantly, auto scanning for airplanes and more. The most blatant hacking ive seen in years. Do not buy if you are planning to seriously play this game and try to get good at it."
Wouldnt launch
Amazing game but amazing cheater too
"There's no progression since the only version of the game you can buy now comes with the stupid ""Pay money to unlock literally every item!"" thing so levelling up does nothing."
no bots to create own server dog sh how do you not add bots and give you the freedom to make your own private lobby rtrds
EA sucks meat thangs
Constant disconnections fuck EA suck my ding dong.
"3/10 and then only for online. The company is made very poorly. The main problem is changing the story and it would be fine to just change it, so there are also constant errors in the form of: 1 Disabling the interface (when you can't do anything) right during the game (not during cutscenes, but right in the game). 2 Texture patching. 3 Constant detection by the bot when it is not looking in your direction. 3 The lack of a cartridge in the new weapon (just a clip and that's it). 4 The inability to skip a video (when it always was, and then at one point there is no video), etc. But the biggest problem is not even related to the company, I'm talking about the constant intro that cannot be skipped or removed (and okay, the first time it's beautiful, but when you enter the game 5 times it starts to anger you) and you can only remove it yourself. Bottom line: the game is raw, they just created a normal online for pumping money, and they scored a bolt for the most interesting thing."
"Battlefield V could have been a masterpiece, thanks to its powerful engine and innovative gameplay, but it seems the developers decided to bury its potential under the weight of historical inaccuracy. It's like buying the latest car model with the most advanced technologies, only to find out it can't go faster than a tricycle.

The game, which could have revived historical battles with unprecedented accuracy, instead presents itself as an empty museum exhibit—beautiful, but soulless and meaningless. The developers of Battlefield V seem to have forgotten that games are not just entertainment, but also a storytelling medium capable of inspiring and educating. They chose to ignore an entire chapter of history, depriving players of the opportunity to experience it for themselves.

The lack of the ability to play as the Soviet Union in Battlefield V is not just an oversight; it's a historical injustice. After all, some of the most significant and bloody battles of the war took place on the Eastern Front. Ignoring such a fact is not just a lapse in game design, but a collapse in historical accuracy.

Apparently, DICE assumed that 85% of German soldiers on the Eastern Front simply died of exhaustion while wandering through the vast USSR.

Battlefield V is as realistic as the movie ""Cowboys & Aliens."" A game that could have become a classic will now be remembered as an example of how not to make historical shooters. The developers didn't just miss an opportunity—they actively rejected it, preferring sterile fiction over living history. This is not just an oversight; it's a betrayal of the memory of those who fought and died defending the world.

A game that could have been a bridge between the past and the present has instead become a reminder that history can be rewritten or forgotten if we are not vigilant."
"got the game, it was running fine and i enjoyed it until i started getting disconnected from ea servers every 5 minutes,
tried every google solution but nothing works, now its unplayable for me."
**** this ******* shit **** game fix your app EA
"游戏是好游戏    就是这个EA APP登录很恼火    花钱买罪受      每次登录都要整很久
不晓得这鬼EA的工程人员是辞职了吗    进个游戏都那么恼火

always find cheaters in every match
still runs doesnt run very good
"If you enjoy constantly being killed by cheaters in tanks, this is the game for you"
CRASH MULU ANJIR
"hackers in official dice server
hackers in robot servers.
hackers even with EA anticheat."
"If EA not solve hacker problem, this game will ruin all your expectations of it, If you have a 1:1 or 1:6 chance of encountering cheats in other games, then you will experience a 1:50 or even 3:50 experience with cheats in this game"
Bored game
new anticheat blocks people from playing on linux using proton. terrible decision from EA as usual.
"Game is good but it is unplayable on Asian official servers because of cheaters with instakill/aimbots. You have to join community games but unfortunately most of them doesn't allow you to use the fun stuff like shotguns,  self loading rifles, and anti materiel rifles."
It's just call of duty with way too many vehicles. Miserable
"Tl; dr
Game looks good and is illogical and humorously unrealistic. 

Advertised as realistic, which is not the case. It got some minor things correct like not including a Sturmgewehr 44 in a campaign which takes place in 1943. At the same time, it gives the player a reflex sight on a Thompson with a 50rd drum mag which holds 30 rounds. A suppressed gun in the first level which appears to be firing a pistol caliber (it seems as if it was feeding from 1911 mags) does more damage when hitting the torso then a 98k. 

A rifle caliber is outclassed by a .45 acp at range.

On hard mode (I don't know about the others) enemies take 3 or 4 bullets to take down and just keep walking as if nothing happened. I put two 7.92 mm bullet in a guy’s torso, and he was still fighting as if nothing happened. The Flak has almost no drop. 

You can attack the bombers which fly around passively while doing stunts??? And I hit them a bunch of times and they do not seem to take damage nor go down or change their behavior. Maybe it was just coincidence though.

The beginning of the story seems illogical too. Why send someone who is visibly unwilling to cooperate with authorities to the enemies of said authority? And doing all that in a mission where desertion would be a piece of cake. 

The Germans in the campaign also shoot Panzerfausts at you, despite those being anti-tank weapons featuring shaped explosives which are best used for armor, a grenade or simply attempting to shoot the enemy would be a far better choice. Enemies also track you through terrain. Rocks are also modelled poorly; sometimes thick rocks simply get shot through and serve no purpose other than contributing to the game’s great landscapes. 

It looks good, maybe that is something that speaks for it, I guess.

Just for context, I used to be a Tarkov enjoyer with a love for games such as warthunder and Mil-Sim. I love RoN and Insurgency Sandstorm despite them not trying too hard to achieve realism. With a game wanting to tell fictional stories about actual events in real life realism has got to play a factor. Maybe it was designed like this for the purpose of playability and user experience, but with the number of bullets enemies take to go down I cannot disagree more intensely.

But maybe I am just too autistic for fun though."
So buggy
"Lots of bugs af, not recommended to buy"
"Not fun to play, huge downgrade from BF1. It's like they weren't even trying with this ""WW2 game"". Don't recommend it even on sale.

Edit: And what's up with all these super restrictive gameplay mechanics (no full auto heal, low ammo count, can't self repair vehicle etc.)?? 
Call me a casual, but it feels like I'm being forced to play this game on hardcore mode when I really don't want to. Makes it all the more difficult for beginners to compete."
"fuck you EA!! bullshit anti cheat my ass... cheaters is everywhere, they have no balls, no bitches, no shame and no parents."
WILL ban me on EA Play for offending Chinese Cheaters. WON'T Ban said Chinese Cheaters
good game. but cheating every match.
Combined arms is unplayable because of all the loading problems
"This game was great. It lived up to the hype. Then EA found out they were doing good on player amount and player happiness was high. So they made the game only launch from their crappy launcher, forced their anitcheat that will not work, and refuses to do anything about it because they have a new game out now that is the worst battlefield ever made. I want to play this game with my friends soo bad but im stuck going through EA game launcher. Also when i finally get into a match i get killed instantly by some hacker with 200:0 kd. gaming is dead and EA made it happen"
"Had tons of fun playing this on the steam deck, now after an update anticheat prevents boot. EA is so lame nowadays"
thats fucked up
"game stuck on loading screen permanently right after i bought it, that's a start.
someone link my Steam Account to a random EA account, the EA support is shit, they hide the support button on their website, wont respond to my ticket, and whenever i try to chat on their website, it says ""error, wait for a while"" something like that and after i waited, the fucking notification said time out.

fixed the issue about infinite loading screen, try to join a match and then the issue went back on.
and also
EVERYTIME you turn on your PC, you will be greeted with the shittiest logo of your life

game is a mess, not worth your time"
cheters aimbot speehack  jeast bad experince vs cheaters
"I'm extremely disgusted by the ""developers"" and investors of this ""game studio"". They just brought a kernel-level spyware (what they call anticheat - don't forget it's for ""our safety"") as an update to their newer ""games"", funnily this also includes Battlefield V since last month, even though it's an older game.

This breaks playing the game on Linux, for the ones that cannot care less about Linux gameplay, this introduces a massive security/privacy-hole into your system. We don't know what they exactly collect, where this gets all uploaded, when they are doing this - since everything is uploaded encrypted and the source of it not available.

As a gamer it's your duty to stfu and swallow the pill. It is way too obvious this ""game studio"" does not care about it's customers anymore. They will also include that kernel-virus with newer releases as well. I won't update the games I have from them anymore, won't buy newer ones. Then they have the audacity to lecture us about piracy.

Since this rollout happened silently and not many noticed the ""game studio"" is not getting enough heat. I would say do your part for anybody reading this."
"Does not support use of Wine for Linux users for some reason out of no where with the past updates.
Dumb.

Get Funked EA no longer supporting the PUBLISHER and urge others to do the same."
"Between the non-monitored chat & hackers I cannot recommend. Seems to lack some balance; getting shot through walls, too many snipers allowed, medic speed is abused, very slow time to raise your weapon to shoot on mouse/keyboard but not controller, and player upgrades for those with many hours makes them harder to kill. Many times I've pumped someone with 5+ rifle rounds to the upper body only for them to take me out with one shot using a pistol as they side swipe/slide right at me, a virtually impossible move on keyboard. Being that upgrades can be purchased with $$ (in game currency) this borderlines a ""pay-to-play"" advantage. I also notice a lot of new players frustrated as their XP is weak & player moves/weapons/vehicles are poor while high hour players have complete advantage; speed, weapons, vehicle repairs & hit points, and not to mention the squad wiping bombs that only higher hour players can use in-game. I have given this game try after try yet it is very hard to get good or enjoy unless you are a master FPS player or have the cash to burn. It doesn't help that many players camp out the spawn points, driving away many new & existing players. One match we were down to 5? players against 20 others because people were so frustrated with being farmed at spawn they quit or restarted on another server. Have also noticed that building with mouse/keyboard is slower & glitches more than with a controller. Try for yourself if you wish but the first time your entire team gets bombed by an airplane immediately after spawning into a new match or you encounter the other major issues I have then you will feel the same about the game as thousands of other do especially when the hardcore high-hour players openly chat about ""spanking the noobs"" or some other racist or vulgar slander against new players giving the game a chance. Other fps games have similar issues to a point but they also seem to have a moderator presence unlike BF5 or a functional way to report issues."
"I do not know what they did to the game with the recent update(s), it literally broke my PC. I've had 3 Blue Screens, 1 CTD, and 3 freezes (when I had to manually reboot my computer) all in a single day. Mind you - all other games, including EA games, such as Battlefield 1, launch without an issue."
Literally unplayable. Just downloaded the game and can't run it due to anticheat
"no skateboards, this game SUCKS"
"Cheater infested sewer. People actually play as groups to cheat. It's actually funny to see people with CLAN tags cheat through the match like it is part of the core gameplay. If you are gonna buy this game, just make sure that you are okay with cheaters and have no trouble leaving the match and finding another."
white screen on startup thanks losers
Electronic ARTifacts.
EA KONTOOOOOOOOL
this is a trash
"Unplayable. Doesn't even launch anymore. 
Just ends up ""validating"" in an endless loop that you can't fix. I've edited the registry, I've uninstalled and reinstalled this game, Steam, EA Launcher and even my operating system several times. I've moved the game and all launchers to different hard drives, etc. No luck.

Absolutely useless garbage and waste of money. 
This is what happens when you focus on maximising the amount of money you can suck out of customers instead of using profits to ensure a decent game service. 

I do not recommend this game."
crashes every 2 seconds
"After they added the new EA Anti-cheat, I get constant stuttering and the game is unplayable."
"Bought for $7 and while this game is obviously a well polished Battlefield game with tons of content, it wasn't worth it due to the prevalence of cheating in multiplayer. Received a refund thankfully."
Most dogshit game of all time
"Game sucks, the tanks have no physical weight to them, so you end up flying when you hit a trench or sand bag, anything to fricking launch you into the air. takes 30+ rounds to kill someone, going back to HLL, which is an actual game, not whatever this bull*cks is supposed to be. EA when you gunna make a game that's half decent again? and provide servers that prevent hackers from getting in"
"Tried playing through the single player campaign for the achievements. I don't want to finish it anymore. Over 5 years after launch and there are still game breaking bugs, causing enemies in a stealth mission to spawn behind you and alert, your weapons to disappear after swapping too fast, and the dynamic lighting system leaving you blind after crossing thresholds. Not to mention any issues with the multiplayer"
Can't play with my friends and it kick us out of team many time
"After I installed the EA anticheat I couldn't open the game. Literally uninstalled EA and Battlefield V over 3 times. Nothing changed, did all steps on the internet to troubleshoot the issue to no avail. You ruined the game."
cheaters everywhere!!!!
"Listen, this game is absolutely fantastic. The way it's designed, it fully immerses you into the imagination of being a soldier in WWII, the mechanics are satisfying, the guns feel real.

Everything is great, right up until you watch a soldier - on foot - moving at 150km/h and firing his M1 Garand at 20 rounds per second. Hmmm, something doesn't add up there, no?

So you think to yourself, ""Surely they aren't.... cheating?""

Check the scoreboard;
90+ kills
0 deaths

Then you report them. And leave. Find another match;

Apparently the Germans had a living, breathing superman in their army because now you have a guy zooming around, knowing where everyone is, annihilating your entire team.

I've requested a refund because I had about 4 or 5 games in a row like this, with someone blatantly cheating and ruining the immersion into what should have been the greatest WWII simulator ever made."
Worst fucking multiplayer experience. Why can't you fuckers solve the cheating problem? Literally every single multiplayer game has cheaters on it.
2/3rd of all your matches will be ran by cheaters who don't even hide it cause they don't get banned. Bonus points if they're from another server like china cause they like to server hop to spread their degeneracy of ongoing rampant cheating.
"As I stated in the refund request:
Hell Let Loose is a superior game in every conceivable way."
Somehow worse than 2042
"Impossible to play on linux, also lmao @ that guy who told me not to buy the game (never did)"
"DONT BUY THIS GAME developers give big discounts on games...beause in the game cheaters are still roaming around...like wallhacks, run very fast in the game...different from other players...DEVELOPER sucks"
hackers and politicians are the worst people on the planet
"This is basically similiar to enlisted, not as i expected, play battlefield 1 its better

will refund"
"i Really want to like the game but the amount of cheaters and neglect of them is astonishing. they dont even hide that they are cheating, they rub it in your face because EA and DICE wont do anything. oh they came in a lot of flavor too, starting from the usual wallhack and 1 hit kill to the speed hack, the camping beyond the map hack, to infinite ammo hack so they spam grenade and stuff. they do it in YOUR FACE, they want you to know that they are cheating. unbelievable. 

dont even get me started on the whole Origin or whatever EA wanna call it nowadays, it complicated things, i just wanna play with my friends but i gotta go through a whole heap of mess just to accept a friend request so we can invite each other in game."
"Good graphics, weak gameplay. Brainless shooter."
"[b] In 2024, a company like EA shouldn't allow itself to use such a crappy launcher that doesn't allow me to play in peace. I wish the worst to that failure who programmed the launcher. [/b]"
game is horrible ea is a shit heap of a company have 35 mins from literally just trying to get it to launch garbage game its so sad too bc i loved this game had like 1k hrs on console and they cant figure out how to get the game to run on pc sad
game runs like garbage
F_CK EA
Its very buggy and im still not even able to play after a day of trying everything
"EA taints everything it touches. Wiped my account clean on multiple games, including this one."
....
"There's seriously Zero point of even playing online games anymore! You can't play anything without running into cheating scum! Well, good thing I only paid 7 dollars! If it's not single-player, I'm not buying it anymore. Tired of wasting my money and I can't even play the game fairly because of cheating scum. I seriously only played 2 matches and ran into 3 people spawning in behind you constantly and snapshotting you in the dome every time you run into to them and there's no time to even react to them. Cheating 100%. Anti-cheat my ass."
Couldn't get a single game without a hacker in it.
"The anticheat is so invasive that it will slow down your system even when the client isn't open (I'm talking like a slideshow when I start my computer sometimes on a 7800 X3D and a 7900XT), and it is so ineffective that it still fails to stop a significant portion of cheaters. I don't care how fun the game might be; that is completely unforgivable. Especially considering how shitty EA is as a company on top of this glaring flaw, don't spend a single cent on this game. If it was completely free with no micro-transactions, it still wouldn't be worthwhile."
"played BF1 for 500+ hour, feel that BF5 Kind of suck compair to BF1, graphics is worse and needs a better gpu, motion of the characters are way less smooth than BF1. 
The major problem is that you can't feel the intense feeling of battle field anymore, sniper rifles are very terrible can't aim accuratly with iron sight anymore, UI is much more complicated
very few community servers, you wouldn't want to go to official servers cause all kinds of cheaters and game hack adv
missed the refund time and wasted me $8 when I bought it with discount, could have done so much things with it other than buying this game.
everyone do not get fooled by the CG above, this game does not worth it, not at least $8"
"before the new anti cheat it was meh
now i can't even play the game >:("
Bait and switch to a kernel level malware anti-cheat
"So, I have ReWASD installed due to cubital tunnel syndrome.
My pinky and ring fingers basically barely work on my left hand due to compression of the cubital nerve running through the elbow. Use of the two fingers has become arduous.
I use ReWASD to map a joystick to wasd movement, without any controller functionality remaining, all so that I can still play otherwise normally with a mouse.

I would be willing to take a step back, playing with only a controller, if it would let me. But you see...

As a result of the program being installed, not even running, I am incapable of playing Battlefield V. In fact, having uninstalled the software, scouring the registry for any entries that needed removal, and restarted, I still cannot play.

As a result, I'd say is that what I have seen is pretty great.

EA, reminder that instead of blocking players from starting the game when ReWASD is detected, you can just do what ""The Finals"" does and disable Aim Assist. Y'all are a riot these days."
would be more fun without tanks and planes - theyre so OP you can't stay alive more than 30 seconds. luckily i bought this game for $7 not $60 - which is a scam. buy this game if you suck at fps and rather sit in a vehicle to get all your kills
Bought it on sale only for last tiger
what is this shiaat
Unplayable. Game doesn't work. Can't review game because it literally wont open.
linux support is now borked!
Cant play the game anymore
Can't even launch the game
stinky sweats
Worse than previous Battlefields in all aspects. Holy s***.
Shits worse than 2042
EA anticheat didn't do shit still full of hackers
at first i like the game but now its lagging
FUCK YOU EA LAUNCHER
"Can't call this a Battlefield, shit maps.. 
BF1942 & BF2 and BF4 are the best Battlefields"
"Used to work, now it doesn't. Just let us play the game instead of forcing me to run an OS I don't want to, or install some trojan keylogger crap.

Companies ought to be required to give a refund when they break something you bought"
Cant get to start with all sign in requirements
"EA's anticheat can't stop cheater, but stop me logging.
Very nice EasyAntiCheat, make the progress bar slow.
HEAT FROM china."
"Game is absolutely beautiful and game-play is absolutely great. But multiplayer, them servers specially the asian servers are rigged with hackers and EA gives 0 shit about this. The asian server chat box are spammed by hackers that will snipe you from miles away no matter if they are playing infantry or flying a god damn plan. They just single or double tap you no matter where you are. And this ""You have lost connection to the EA server, connection offline"" error, your dumbass server is the actual issue EA. Origin was way better than your crap."
"Game is unplayable on my laptop with a 4060, crashes constantly to point of being unplayable, will load into a match, sometimes won't even load, walk ten feet then the game will just close to the desktop with no crash reporter or anything popping up, this is entirely ridiculous.

By far the worse battlefield ever made, the vehicles are horribly unbalanced, every gun feels downright god awful to use, the maps are downright terrible and will lead to getting spawn camped almost every singe match, not to mention the absolute unplayable amount of cheaters on the official dice servers, just save your time and energy and go play the new cod because despite that game being a burning pile of garbage it is still better than this."
Cheaterfield™ V
No longer supports Proton.  COD and BF can go to hell.
"If you wan't to be bombarded by Plane sweating people go ahead, otherwise better not buy it. As usual for EA their games are not like they used to be."
"I have about 80 hours in Battlefield V from my time of playing it through EA Play.

Breakthrough player here, I love the Battlefield games, this used to be one of my favorite games. The start was rocky, but it picked itself back up. However, time and time again, this game has been ruined by cheaters. Today, it's worse than I ever remember it. I CANNOT play this game without encountering someone blatantly cheating and killing me from across the map upon peaking a corner that there was no possible way that player could have known I was hiding at. Dice added a new kernel level anticheat that was supposed to remedy this problem, but it didn't do anything. I still encounter so many cheaters and can't play the game enjoyably. For reference, the top killer on our team had 11 kills, while cheaters on the other team had 50 kills and 1 DEATH? Also as a reflection of the series in general, Battlefield 2042 is dead. I can't queue breakthrough lobbies without 80% of the players being AI, Battlefield 1 has a worse cheater problem than Battlefield V and there are less players too. Wait for Battlefield 2025, I hope Dice can redeem themselves then.

Tldr: A good game that has been ruined by cheaters. Either I'm really unlucky or every lobby I get into has someone blatantly cheating."
"trash EA service, wont even let me start the damn game without killing 5 processes in task manager, then navigating to an obscure folder location and run their horrid excuse of a game launcher. games fun, but ea should pay for making it unaccessible/damn near unplayable"
For a triple A game is so bug/y and broken...
"Worst battlefield campaign by far

Shit writing"
wtf it was a good game until god fucking EA banned the anti-cheating robot.
I enjoyed the Bad Company(s) but this one just feels like another generic AAA game.
"I have had 806 hours on this game, and I can assure you nearly 25% of that was me running into problems launching the game and running into servers full of cheaters and hackers literally shutting the servers down as they wish.
They have absolutely shattered their reputation and still do not do anything about the many cheaters destroying our gaming experience everyday. I would rather pay for drugs than any other game made by EA, it is a mistake I'll gladly not repeat."
worst
"this game is causing the PC to crash or freeze - no help from EA whatsoever - no, I do not recommend this to anyone."
My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on battlefield V and it gets 150 likes and 50 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.
There's no more servers for me.
game kinda cheeks ngl.
"nope, got cheater every game"
"thank you ea for adding this broken anticheat that makes me have to go through a headache to make all my ea games work (fifa 23, bfv) because its so broken it breaks them and they dont launch"
shitass game
"It’s amazing how in such a game, where so many little details are thought out, there is a terrible imbalance in the form of some weapons (type 2a, m2 carbine, zh-29, shotguns, dmr) and it’s not clear why planes were added to the game, which do not bring strong strategic variety , but they are only annoying (preventing you from leaving the respawn in the first minute after the start of the game, as well as using bombing too often).
And this is not to mention the fact that the game simply has a disgusting balance in the selection of players (there is simply none) and this problem is multiplied by the local community of experienced players who play on the same team and at the same time use imbalanced weapons, leaving no chance for beginners and average players . Because of such players, the influx of new users stops and the game dies."
"I want to like this game as a PC user.

When I play on servers where there are no cheaters, it feels like it's a game of skill. Most of the time it feels like a cruel respawn simulator even after over a hundred hours of playtime

Unfortunately, the few American servers available are basically impenetrable to new players thanks to the pervasiveness of hacking. 

The hackers have completely ruined the experience.

It has gotten noticeably more rotten since the recent supposed anti-cheat update.

I often will play with higher ping on Japanese servers just to experience less exploited rounds of play, and as a reality check when players appear to be more lucky than skilled when spectating."
Just don't buy EA games...
bf1 best
Multiplayer does not work. Impossible to connect.
This game too many cheater and internet problem
"EA is adding their invasive kernel level anti-cheat to Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042 which breaks Steam Deck/Linux support.

Kernel level anti-cheats also create a massive attack surface for security vulnerabilities for Windows users because when an exploit is eventually found in the anti-cheat, it will allow a hacker to compromise the software and gain full, unrestricted permissions to your computer's operating system.

Now some users are okay with sacrificing security and privacy for getting rid of cheaters. A major problem with this is that kernel anti-cheat isn't actually fully effective. Cheaters have already found various methods of bypassing kernel anti-cheat detection. This has already been proven possible and demonstrated on YouTube using games like Valorant. This type of anti-cheat evasion will likely never fully go away as more companies are getting into selling hardware cheats, which are often harder to detect.

Risking the security of your computer over video games is simply not worth it. Especially if you have any sensitive data stored on your system (socials, banking info, passwords, login cookies, authenticators, etc.)"
"the game is still full of hackers, the multiplayer doesnt work due to the lack of servers and players. it looks like a dying game to me specially since DICE ruined the battlefield franchise after battlefield 1"
Game still has silly bugs after years from release. Some gun skins don't unlock once you have reached or surpassed the need gun level. Tried working it out with EA support a few times with no fix.
I enjoyed 170 hours of this game until EA forced anticheat that doesn't support Linux. Now it's unplayable and a waste of money. Don't purchase if you intend to play on steam deck or other Linux OS.
"I reinstall this game once or twice a year(which is a huge waste of 90 gigs of data gotta say) and every time I return to it I'm immediately reminded of why I left in the first place. Horrible balance, stagnant community, overbearing vehicles and planes manned by absolute no-lifers. Just genuinely unfun for probably 9 out of 10 matches and a clear team-stomp with no real counter play. Maybe one game a session will be close with some fun back and forth's. Otherwise its just vehicles circling the drain capping points in a dead franchise."
dumb anti cheat for steam deck :(
Full of cronus zen and macro mouse players.
"Game crashes, unable to enter the game.

can't play the game after stup1d anti cheat update
"This isnt a good game by any means, but its better than 2042."
Good game but dead
Thanks to E(normous) A(ssholes) and their wonderful update this game is no longer playable on a steam deck.
"Wtf bro, when i play story mode my game always gets stuck on the black screen after the first cutscene. DON'T BUY THIS SH1T... F#ck you EA"
Every Great game have it cheap copy
"Really well made game and all but the playerbase turns this game into a torture device that Satan himself would vomit at the sight of it. Here are the type of people you are going to meet playing BFV (or most BF'S in the matter)

1. Snipers. These people will sit on the edge of the map, watching you, and sniping you at the most random moment. You can't do anything to them, cause they spend their miserables lives training to be fzzcking Hawkeye and ruining people's day. They will know if you try to sneak up on them, and they will pity you for trying

2. Pilots. Want to try out the planes for the first time? Well good luck trying to fend off the bloodlusted plane that is flying behind you and who can kill you in 4 fzzcking seconds because they can predict what manuevers your going to enact to try to survive. They'll even torment you on the ground. They'll come out of  nowhere and hit you with a bomb using the most precise aim they can muster up. Or maybe they'll just shoot bullets at you. Eitherway, your dead.

3. Swoopers: About to kill someone? Well kiss that dream goodbye because some random arse will show up out of nowhere and kill you just right before you can get your kill. They always show up out of nowhere. They know where you are and you can't stop them. Nothing can't stop them. As soon as you found your target, the swooper will materialize out of thin air and make sure you don't get that kill.

Medics who don't revive even though I am RIGHT THERE: If you are one of these people, kindly drink arsenic

And before I finish off this review, let me present you a phenomenon.

If you spawn in with a sniper rifle or long range weapon,you are going to fight against people who have close range weapons and will die easier. If you decide to spawn with close range weapons, 

EVERY SINGLE PERSON WILL APPARENTLY HAVE A LONG RANGE WEAPON.

 YOU CANNOT WIN, THIS GAME IS ABOUT DYING AND RESPAWNING,DYING,RESPAWNING,DYING,RESPAWNING,KILL,DYING,DYING,DYING. IF YOU ARE STILL READING THIS. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. YOU WILL BECOME THE THING YOU HATED. EVERYTIME YOU DIE YOU WILL FACE YOUR INNERMOST INSECURITIES. THEY WILL COME OUT OF YOU AND POINT EVERY SINGLE MISTAKE YOU HAVE EVER FREAKING DONE.

AND IF YOU IGNORE THESE WARNINGS, THESE HECKLINGS THAT FACE YOU. THEN ONLY YOUR FLAWS WILL BE YOUR DEFINING FEATURE. YOU WILL BECOME A FLAWED BEING.

Otherwise fun game, campaigns is decent enough.

8/10"
"It doesn't launch from Steam, the EA app, or launch in admin mode. It's a completely broken game, I've tried everything, verifying installation, moving it to my main drive, removing the overlay, uninstalling and reinstalling,  etc. Don't buy anything from EA, they were voted the worst company two years in a row for good reasons. Even though I bought this on sale for dirt-cheap a long time ago, it's still completely worthless because the entirety of my playtime has been spent trying to launch this worthless waste of hard drive space published by a fraudulent, cancerous corporation."
I can't start up the game after anti-cheat update.
"After the last anticheat there are more unbearable cheaters than before. Game is not playable in online mode anymore.
I want my money back!"
EA Rootkit BS borked this game on lunix
"The anti-cheat has arrived, No cheater clapping my cheeks from anywhere/anytime now."
"500 hours in a nutshell.
-Classes.
Classes in BF5 are represented by:
Assault. The most universal class, prepared for fights at all distances (even at long range ""thanks"" to DMRs). It has a lot of different types of explosives to kill tanks, planes and infantry.
Medic. King of close range gunfights. A highly necessary class equipped with infinite medkits and the ability to revive your teammates. Perfect pick for small maps. Also if you want to be more effective beyond 20m you can try bolt-action carbines(quaza sniper rifles for middle range encounters).
Support. You have 2 choises here. First is take light machinegun/shotgun and play as assault with less explosive firepower and throw ammo crate every 30 seconds to ressuply your teammates gadgets. Second is quite sad tbh, medium machineguns cannot fire using scope without deployed bipod so your fate is to lie on the hill where you become easy target and didnt help your teammates or hold a coridoor staying behind some box or lying on the ground.
Recon. At least game didnt lie to you. There is no Sniper class in BF5. Foes no longer appear on a minimap during gunfights. So it is your job to spot them for your team using recon gadgets. Long range sniping is not a reliable option due to the slide mechanic, optical glare, killcam and even if you do land a bodyshot soilders often have medkit in a pocket and you have to unscope between shots to load a new round into a chamber, losing visual contact with your enemy for a short time. As a result, you must close the distance and face enemies with DMRs and automatic weapons.
-Combat roles.
Little things that can noticeably improve some abilities of a class. Choose wisely.
-Squad.
 When you play with dedicated group of people game become much more interesting and funnier. You can revive members of your squad no matter what class you play (Medic does it quickly). Squad leaders have abbility to call airstrike, missile with huge kill radius, vehicles and supplyes to help your team or squad  win the games.
-Currency and unlocking system
Battlefield V has a huge variety of skins for soldiers, weapons and vehicles. Some of them are behind a paywall. But you can get a lot of cosmetics for free currency called Company Coins. You get these coins for daily tasks, new ranks e.t.c. Exactly these Company Coins you should spend to upgrade your weapons and vehicles (more detailed in guns and vehicles section). You start with stock guns, tanks, planes and in 90% of the time you will face enemies with upgraded ones. Obvious disadvantage for new players.
-Guns.
Huge varioty for different playstyles and situations. They are very detailed and sound amazing. Each weapon has its own progression system called specialization. Playing with a particular weapon will allow you to upgrade it 4 times, one upgrade per level, using Company Coins. Basically, there are two branches of specialization, one focused on long-range firefights and precision shooting and the other for close combat and shooting from the hip. You can switch from one branch to the other only in designated levels. If you miss this place, you can change the branch only by upgrading the weapon to the end. This means that you will have to play in uncomfortable conditions and suffer for your ""ignorance"" and only then do everything properly. Idiocy. Another problem is again the gamebalance. Most of the playerbase didnt realize/care they play witn extremly overpowered weapons. For example ZH-29 makes all sniper rifles useless on Recon, all Assault semi-automatic rifles dominate everything except a high TTK SMGs at close range. Shotguns simply spit in the face of ballance. Named just a couple. 
-Wehicles.
Vehicles just like guns have specialization and we have the same problem, if you chose wrong bench of specialization you stuck with it untill you compliete it to the end. Problem here is even worse because you are not always playing on tanks or planes, and some spec-s change the gameplay drastically. Planes in this game are ridiculous. Pilots with at least 2 barin cells will go on 70-0 killstreaks, and if you want to stop air domination reliably, you will be stuck on a stationary AA platform or you can steal a possible normal and more universal tank slot just to use mobile AA wich only good against planes and because of that you lose your game potential. Tanks sitting on the edge of the map will not help your team advance and will ruin the game for the opposing team.
-Test range.
Has the most basic functionality, all the good stuff from the polygon in BF4 is not added. It is suitable only for initial game setup and performance/graphics tests. A full arsenal of weapons is available on the range, but without the ability to test different specializations. Idiotic decision.
-Maps.
They all look fantastic, you can walk around and find some new details erery match. Gameplay wise most of them are ok, some are great, and some push the toxicity of this game community to its limits.
-Community.
Because of its casual nature, newcomers will be playing with and against experienced players, which can make games extremely frustrating, especially if you come up against a squad of good players. High ranked players will destroy teams with all-rounder weapons and newbies will try to catch up with op guns. For a middle of the road player this is pure hell. 
-EA.
After the recent anti-cheat implementation, the cheating problem is less acute but you will encounter cheaters a lot. EA keeps a high standard as usual: problems with entering the game, problems with connecting to a squad or a friend on the server, unfinished game, crazy bugs from time to time.
-Conclusion.
You can enjoy this game for some of its aspects or play with friends and just have fun/tryhard. It can give you roller coaster of emotions. But if you want to play it solo only because its game of Battlefield series you can safely skip this one."
NOPE
"frames suck, and if you want a good time, then you better already have a squad because randoms sit back at spawn and miss every shot...almost fun, yet still somehow better than cod in 2024...????"
"They updated it so that us, Steam Deck and Linux users can no longer play. I paid for this game, spent my time on it, even after how badly they massacred the franchise, just so that they can flip me off in the face."
Plagued by cheaters.
SHIT GAME
"i play it 10 fps
please donate better pc"
"READ THIS IF YOU PLAYED BATTLE FIELD 1 !!!
The game looks and plays great !!....but :\
edit:-
1)the game is riddled with hackers 
2)the gun progression system is extremely frustrating , as in order to unlock the full potential of a gun you need to keep grinding with it to keep unlocking its parts / perks and slightly better its performance....this mechanic sounds good when written down but when you and your enemy are in a 1v1 and you have to compensate your aim for the recoil and the enemy dont (while both having the same weapon) its quite infuriating and annoying 
3)the paciffic campaign is extremely unfair for the US as the enemy blows up almost every beach landing ships (my opinion)
4) every nation has access to the weapons of every other nation....why?... i dont know....its extremely stupid and ruins the atmosphere of the game  (this was also in bf1 yet the ww1 weaponries was completely unknown to most of the playerbase {including me} thus it went unnoticed but when you hand an garand to a natsi.....it catches ones eyes)
5) except some maps every other map looks like an artistic landscape lacking the grittiness of war which was soo well balanced in the predecessor game bf1 also almost every map has this annoying chokepoints for the defender and the attacker where the fight will go on in an alley way or in an cave entrance for several minutes with no flanking path available for both of the team and the battle is stuck in an annoying stalemate unless one of the team calls an V12 or shoves an tank in the enemy lines lol extremely annoying 
6) the lootboxes which used to open with in game currency is gone and now you can only get the skins you like with actual money or ridiculously high amount of ingame currency......extremely disappointed
7) dont get the class shortcut packs it gives you all the guns taking away all the sence of accomplishment which one would get if they got  the guns by completing the challenges (i didnt read the whole delux edition description thinking it was the game pack with only map dlcs lol)
8) the lack of behemoths  and special infantry type is also unwelcome
9) While in multiplayer matches  sudden  appearance of natsi soldiers in iwo jima and japanese soldiers in amsterdam is extremely stupid and the idea of  tacky outfits and stupid legendary charecters also ridiculous 
10) not neccessarily a huge problem but they removed the  collectible dogtags which could have been only achieved by completing varried difficult tasks or challenges which was in bf1 and unlocking them was huge fun for me 
11) Apparently this stupid fucking game also has connectivity issues
12) Also the menu UI sucks....as battlefield 1's menu  looked and felt awesome to toggle through but this felt like windows 8 
13) this fucken game also has an annoying mechanic in which, if you die you have to hold RMB to die quicker... like if you dont you will lay there with bloody hands ...longer.... i mean who asked for this ? all while your charecter groans and moans there is no alternative you have to tolerate this after EVERY DEATH !! 
 I absolutely hate this game 
14) most of the support guns are too heavy to be fired standing , you cant fire it until and unless you are prone  in other words the whole support class in this game is useless  (its an overexaggeration but actually some of the support weapons are not viable for pvp)
15) They heavily nerfed the sidearms in this game as they do max 40-50 damage if revolver and a STAGGERING 20-30 damage if regular .45. Revolver headshots does noticeable damage yet if you shoot an enemy with a pistol you would require 3-4 consecutive headshots to kill him 
edit:-
one more thing i should add .....upon getting to a certain level with a weapon (lvl 10) its mastery tasks for gold camo unlocks which are quite interesting , by interesting i meant absolutely fucking stupid ,but it provides the best config and looks awesome  so i guess its a great reward after all the grind so thumbs up for doing at least one thing right or better than your predecessor  which only added a star upon killing hundred enemies lol
edit
 another good thing about the game i must say is that, there were some gamechanging skills in bf1  which could be only unlocked upon completing some ridiculously difficult  tasks.....now thats gone bringing some pre defined skills in sub classes of the main classes which in my opinion is a great change !!
edit
they  copied the concept of war thunder a little bit with the tanks which is an automatic thumbs up for me as i love wt , the concept being the more you grind your tanks or planes the more powerful they get unlocking new modifications with every level up but it dosent make sense as one  rarely gets to play with tanks and planes as some of the players litterally wait in the deploy menu camping the tank spaawn......   but still great effort
edit
the campaign is a masterclass in story telling and i would pay good money if someday EA decides to release a skiing game 
edit
ok,just found out about the combined arms fun PVE with little story line felt great to play !!
and also found out about firestorm....... lol"
"Devs kiss my ass. I understand that this is my problem I am on Linux, but still. Surely your ""Anti-cheat"" will work, surely."
"I bought Battlefield V 2023 in October to only play on my STEAM DECK. I do NOT own a PC. EA just enabled 
Anti-Cheat and that has broken Battlefield V on the Stream Deck. 😢 I asked for a refund and steam said because I played 2 hours and more. I am not eligible. If this is what r*pe feels like, I wish it on NOBODY."
Not really good
do not buy ea games they will say you did not buy them you will lose access to them  there is no way for you to get your money back and there help service basically tells you to go fuck your self
asshole ea update my ass

My GPU usage is less than 20% on an RTX 3070. Not sure what's going on behind the scenes but it's terrible cause the game is almost unplayable. Such a shame that they haven't fixed this."

Can't even launch the game after the EAAnticheat implementation. EA please fix this
.
The game / story has no depth
Doesn't work on Steam Deck after last update 😭😢😭😢😭😢
DONT BUY DEAD GAME NO SEVERS AND THE ONES THAT R UP NOBODY MOVES BRAIN DEAD MILSIMERS
"Laughably bad, however the sniping mechanics are enjoyable. Very frustrating game"
Hackermania
"After the Anti Cheat update I cannot run the game! Ha! Good way to remove cheates, just make it so that NOBODY can **** run the **** game. Thanks EA"
trash
This game is absolutely terrible. Every minute I play i find another thing wrong. I'm not sure what they were going for but no game has ever made me want to quite mid mission solely because the game play and design details are so lazily overlooked. Also kernel level anti cheat was just implemented and id sooner lick random public doorknobs than trust ea with access to my system. I could write a book and the games problems but it would be easier to say whats not wrong which is the guns handle well and the stories aren't terrible but not great.
social credit -5
"Fuck EA, can't play on linux anymore"
the game is great the mechanics are cool but in the current state with everyone playing snipers it can just get stale and i get it so many of the guns that arent snipers just feel weird and weak i will continue playing changing my review if people change
refuses to launch
got 2 pacific matches then got a decent rotterdam and crashes absolute garbage
"Their anti cheat broke the game for me... It's not working anymore.

Edit: NOT EVEN STORY MODE WORKS!!"
All in avenger team with cheat
"Don""t waste too much times on games"
Great game and I played it a lot but EA shortly removed ability to play on Linux thanks to its own EAC implementation.
"[b]Warning[/b]: no longer works on Linux

The game itself is ok, nothing crazy in comparison with Battlefield 1.

[b][i]But[/i][/b] they added kernel-level anti-cheat on April 2024, 3.5 years after the original release, completely breaking Linux support (used to work great)."
the story was a let down wasnt much to it
arguably one of the most cinematic fps shooters ove ever played. still dogshit tho
i lag the server many cheater i recommend it but the review is no so yes but no but you know i change my mind maybe yes??? but how so it should no so i guess no and yes.
Keep getting disconnected while my wifi is perfectly fine (70mbps). Keep saying connection timeout. Shitty server.
for as long as it worked it was a BLAST but then it started to crash on startup being a clear mark of why prepietrary or something launchers should not exist.for as long as the problem with launching the game persists i will not reccoment buying this. please wait until EA finally des something. if you buy this game on steam you've basically gotten scammed by EA
no play
"Can no longer play on the steam deck because the latest update introduced anti-cheat features which do not support linux. I only wanted to play the campaign which I can no longer do on the steam deck. Was great fun up until then, but cannot recommend in its current form. If only they would make the single player content available on all platforms, I'd be fine with that, but sadly not the case"
"This game was awesome on release, today it's a shell of itself. Full of hackers and no anticheat, wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy as it is"
"honestly just play battlefield 1, this one just sorta smells"
"Game is busted on steamdeck/Linux due to anticheat. I bought this game to play on my steam deck and don't have a PC to play games on.

This should be illegal."
"Fix your dam game, lagging out hard for no reason"
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.GAME IS FULLLLLLLL OF CHEATERS
EA Anti Cheat killed linux support of the game
Full of hacker. impossible to play. only thing that consider good is graphics
bad poly hit-box/collision
As usual EA borked it for linux and steamOS
"A good game borked by the EA anticheat. Now I can't play the game I have payed, not even in single player mode. Thanks EA!

Just pirate it, it will have no anticheat."
"It's been a bit since I played Battlefield. So a friend bought me this game to try and get me back to playing the series. But a few minutes into the game... I was kicked from a few Chinese managed servers. 

Apparently, if you live in Japan or some ""other country"" near China, they kick you. 
My friends told me that they can tell by your name and ping. 
Why do this? I don't know, my friends also told me that they just don't like Japanese people, allegedly for political reasons it seems ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Game play was fun, but with a toxic community like this aside from the apparent cheating problem, 
It's hard to recommend, especially for fellow Asian players living near China. 

But yeah, come on man, it's just a game. 
Can we just forget about real life and enjoy playing together?"
One more kernel level garbage
I'd rather drag my balls through broken glass than download this new EA Anti Cheat
need to install dogshit ea app to play
"EA borked this for all Linux users, never buy EA"
"compare to BF2042 it's not that bad and i actually have fun in this game ( using type 2a running and shooting every corner in church ), during sale hackers appears more and you should play in community server. It's worth a try ( solid 7/10)"
Does not work anymore on Nobara Linux due to anti cheat software.
"EA is adding their invasive kernel level anti-cheat to Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042 which breaks Steam Deck/Linux support.

This is a problem for a Windows as well, since its introduce a system vulnerability.

Not playable even in singleplayer..."
EAanticheat really?
Between the stuttering and it crashing it's just not worth it...  I have a rtx 4090 and a i9 14900kf and it still doesn't run great.
this would be a good game if it wasn't produced by ea and basically i've played for 16 hours and i've got three kills in those 16 hours and it's a total f****** disaster basically i might as well just bend over and take it up the ass because my opponents can magically see me i'm dead within all a second because the guns just lock onto me apparently and so yeah terrible game waste of money do not buy it unless you like being frustrated also i bought it on steam as you can see so why the hell do i need an ea program running in the background after many hours more of playing the game my opinion hasn't changed it's still a cheating piece of crap designed by ea and it's an ea game what were you expecting we expecting the review to change no it's just as bad as it is before except i can actually get some kills now and yes cheating is rampant
EA/DICE have disabled Steam Deck support entirely.
"Kernel level anti-cheat shouldn't be a thing. I'n not giving a company kernel level access to my system, to which I have no control over what they do, or if the app gets compromised. Not only that, it prevents people who play on Linux based OS's such as SteamOS or even use Linux as their main system to play. EA has been going on a downfall decline, and this just seals the deal. So, fuck you EA."
"Trash since they've neglected it. Poor server quality, exploits, racists galore, so bad"
You can no longer play this game on linux after the anticheat update; similar case for bf1 soon I expect (but hope not)
"Don't get me wrong, the game is made pretty well - in terms of visuals, audio, mechanics, interesting map settings and whatnot. Perhaps the only thing in the game itself that pisses me off is somewhat absurd collision physics - as in tanks running at full speed stopped by the first obstacle they ran into, it's not 2005 anymore, this could have been done better.

BUT.

BFV really is filled with cheaters - I'm new to BFV but after over 10 years in all kinds of shooters, simulators etc. I can tell - things are happening in each match that cannot be explained in any other way than
a) obnoxious bugs that couldn't have been overlooked for 6 or so years since the release
b) cheaters getting stuff done one way or another

And it's typically 1-3 players on each side being suspiciously successful as either aircraft pilots (50-0? this hardly if ever happens, in any combined arms game with contested airspace I'd consider 10-0 a great result) or snipers (picking off anyone who just peeked through their sights? those reflexes!) or just extremely ""lucky"" grunts who somehow shrug off dozens of hits only to 1-shot the opponent from just about any weapon, sometimes hip firing.

AND to combat this, since April I cannot play anymore, apparently EAC is there to combat Linux gamers, not cheaters.

Luckily I got my BFV copy at 80-90% sale, otherwise I would deeply regret it."
EA Anti-Linux trojan.
"Do not buy. The game does not work,"
"Due to an update with the EA Anti-Cheat, the game is now unplayable on Linux. This is a shame and I hope this will not remain the state of this otherwise great game."
"connection issues, by which you cant connecting with any server"
"""EA Anti-Cheat"" has Broken Battlefield V on Linux Indefinitely"
Wow I went into campaign to find missions that involve war gameplay and all the sht that I find is maxpayne bullsht. What are all these stealth bs and one man gameplay?
Servers Make the game unplayable 50% of the time. Good job EA!
This games only saving grace is that Battlefield 2042 saves it from being the worst battlefield game.
good gaym but meny cheeter blyat
傻逼ea 游戏做的再好 平台太垃圾也不能挽回你的负面影响.反作弊系统做出来是反人类的吧.都进不了游戏你做这个系统干鸡毛.还不如不更新继续摆烂都比你这更新的反作弊系统好.草nm傻逼EA si ma东西
They broke it. Steam deck can no longer play.
No longer works on linux.
EA broke Steam Deck support 👎👎👎
"Stopped working after recent update. EA added some cringey anti-cheat that prevents running this game on Linux and SteamDeck.

Do not buy if you don't want to support this anti-competitive behavior."
"I bought the game two years ago, have over 100 hours, and now I can't play it because I use Linux/Steam Deck and EA added their rootkit anti cheat to the game six years after release."
Now broken on Steam Deck
"Game was great, I laughed, ran, hid, and joined in the massive battles with my companions.
We were great!!

Now....... an update has rendered this game completely unusable on my Steam Deck.
Hoping for a fix, but til then, steer clear of this game. Does not launch no more. Only get a message...

""Wine not supported""

Fix the game EA."
"EA borked this game for Linux with the ""EA Anti-Cheat"" Update released yesterday (02.04.24).. at least I could make  100 GB up free space on ma hard disc. 

AGAIN: FU EA!"
"Constant issues launching the game, tried a bunch of various fixes that fixed issues I had with other games since i moved recently i had to wipe DNS, which fixed my rockstar games and made them work.  However no matter how much time I put into trying to fix BF5 to launch , it just won't waste of money i feel got. fix your game"
"Used to work on Linux, the only OS i can reasonably use these days. It does not anymore due to a new EA anticheat... Thanks for bricking this game for me EA."
"This game is another AAA scam, I've bought the game and it worked fine until they release their updates and block people from access it, so yes it does not work on Linux ""anymore"", but before they took my money it did right

They want to update the multiplayer anti cheat, great I don't really care, but don't ruing the single player, the sole reason I've bought this game in the first place. The way they done this feels like another scam because since the game worked, of course everyone will be over the refund period, now I'm stuck with a game that doesn't work anymore

Until they make single player available on Linux again, I'm keeping a negative review"
"So after years working on Linux, Electronic Arts decided to trigger a Kill Switch in this game in the form of a kernel-level anticheat/trojan for Windows which prevents the game from running in my operational system. Even if what I want is just to play the single-player campaign. I can't run it anymore and the game now mocks me saying that ""wine is not supported!"".

This is not only anti-consumer. This is very close to a criminal activity. I can't believe that's not illegal."
"It is a sad thing to have a mother without a plug-in, but we do n’t know who his father is. After all, everyone can be his father."
"Years after release, EA has made changes that break compatibility with Linux."
"fuckin anti cheat. I aint cheatin, why you stopped this game on my steamdeck?"
A boring game no different than BF1 besides timeline and weapons. Cheaters in every lobby and admins that kick you for killing them.
"LINUX/PROTON users, DO NOT BUY! I was just getting through the single player when EA decided to update with their EA Anti-Cheat and now get a ""Wine is not supported!"" pop-up.

"This game is EXTREMELY mediocre. 

The campaign mode (or ""War Stories"") is very short and poor quality. 
Since the missions are so short, there is no time for the characters to naturally develop or time to grow attached to them. The ""emotional"" moments are laughable and cringe-worthy. I enjoyed Battlefield 1's campaign so this was a huge step down from that.

Sometimes the game would glitch and my bullets wouldn't register, so some enemies wouldn't take any damage even when directly hitting them. Sometimes guns wouldn't fire at all. This glitch was infrequent but still very frustrating. 

The multiplayer is also disappointing. 
--The game doesn't have enough map variety.
--The maps are too large and not well designed. Most maps are very open so be prepared to get sniped all the time. Since the maps are so large, there is a lot of down time between fights which can get boring. The TTK is also way too fast. 
--The building and fortification mechanic is interesting, but overall it is a gimmick and adds nothing to the game. 

When I last played (a few days ago) the game was littered with hackers. In one match, a hacker kept insta-killing EVERYONE in the entire lobby- including his own team. EA recently released an update to counter these cheaters and only time will tell if it actually worked. 

The worst thing about this game is that it is ahistorical and disrespectful in its depiction of WWII.

Overall, I do not recommend this game. Buy Battlefield 1 instead. 

4/10"
You'll likely not find a lobby that doesn't have a hacker or two in it. It sucks because the game can be really fun but the anti-cheat is a joke. Hackers' obsession with ruining multiplayer experiences is something that needs to be studied.
"too many cheaters, too many glitches, too many bs ways to play. not worth it, play battlefield 4. less room for bs like this or warzone bs"
Not Playable For 2024. Hackers Everywhere... RIP Battlefield V.
No longer works on Steam Deck/Linux
"This is by far the worst battlefield i played,even bf 2042 is better than this shit,u will interact with cheaters every third match u play,guns are unbalanced,ading scopes and other shity attachments ruined ww2 vibe,maps are supper boring,if you are looking for a fun game to play,definetely avoid battlefield 5"
Piece of shit
They updated and put anticheat and now I can not play because it always shows anticheat did not install correctly. From depth of my hearth. FUCK YOU EA.
"Introduction of EA Anti-Cheat makes it unplayable on Linux. Even if I were to use Windows I would never allow a rootkit on my system (please call kernel level anticheats with their appropriate name - ROOTKIT)!
Screw you EA! Refund request was not honored. What I am supposed to do with this game now?"
"they added ea anticheat, the game doesnt run on linux anymore. i regret buying a game that i can't play anymore."
"Hey, thanks for invading my privacy with your kernel level anti cheat, and an especially big thank you for making this game unplayable on my Steam Deck. With support like this I will definitely be buying EA games in the future!"
"It's an awesome game with some great graphics and mechanics. But if you are looking to play a multiplayer games. This is not the one to go for, mainly because of cheaters. Even when DICE has updated anti cheat service, People are still traversing the whole field in a blink of eye and other sorts of cheats.
It's frustrating to see some players sucking out the fun for everyone from such a great game."
"they recently added kernel level anti-cheat, removing wine support with it altogether"
"Thanks for breaking the game on Linux. What a bunch of clowns, and there are still cheaters in the game more than before."
Kernel level anticheat broke this on my linux machine!
nah.
game for cheaters
"This game is clumsy. It is like a stealth, shoot, walk, hide.  Very little excitement or new concepts."
"the dev let the cheaters playing around, can't kick and report, what a crap game"
.
game full of chinese hackers - avoid
"If you are looking for a great single player game, this is not it.  Just another online multiplayer"
"it's a disgrace to history, it's inaccurate in many ways, I couldn't bring myself to even play the singleplayer because of how boring it was. 
There are certain things which just look goofy especially when it comes to customisation.
Shooting from a tank feels more like throwing a ball rather then firing from a cannon.

If you're looking FPS WW2 game go play something else."

The only thing VAC does is kick you out of a match for no reason whilst cheaters roam free.

its hard for new players but if you are experienced in csgo by means like csgo 1.6 or fn then its a good game for you but not for me

"THE GAME IS BAD its fun but its full of hackers,griefing,and mean players.They kick u without a reason so in 5 games u get kicked out of 3 . and the game needs beter anticheat, the player are so agressive they call u bad words"
"I’ve played this game for over 20 years, since version 1.3 when I was a kid, and it’s been a huge part of my life. But I’m not going to touch it until you fix the problem with cheaters. The game is unplayable right now. It’s heartbreaking to see something I’ve loved for so long ruined by an infestation of cheaters, all because the developers have neglected the anti-cheat system. What’s the point of playing when 6 out of 10 matches on official servers are a cheatfest? Fix it, or you’re throwing away the loyalty of players like me. Besides, where are the game modes from CS:GO we loved? Flying Scoutsman? Demolition? Danger Zone? This review stays negative until at least the anti-cheat is fixed for real."
trash match making
"Who the fuck on the dev team decided ""oh we should make the game easier and more accessible so we can steal valorant faggots""???????? Why the fuck is running headshots so fucking consistent? I and no other player should be able to hold A or D and just get headshots for free? If you want to make a shit game at least give me CSGO back. I'd rather play a lower tick rate older engine CS over some shit that tries to be easier. Like the hearing circle from valorant? Get that shit the fuck out of here lol. Anyways, give me back CSGO and revert the inspect animation update, that shit ugly af."
"This is a though one.
The gameplay is a depature from CS:GO in minor ways, that makes a major difference. The way your pc opperates with the server, and through to the other clients, is different from CS:GO. It has given a lot of advantage to the T-side. Combined with the MR-12 format the balance of CS2 feels off. 
But that is not why I would not recommend the game, as it is just the flavour of gameplay.

I DO NOT recommend this game because of instability issues. What is causing this i do not know. The game crashes to often. Not in every game or every time you connect to a server, but too many times to be calles stable. It destroys the integrity of premier and ranked, as every fourth-fifth match will have someone dropping out due to stability issues.
As soon as this gets better, i would recommend the game.

The cheating problem is not that bad in my experience, but it might fluctuate."
"i got brainrot from it, thanks."
No danger zone - no fun - i can shoot through the big smelly willy pete with lighting now - but pete is still smelly
this game sucks
no
this game will ruin your life
its not that good
"Very unstable game, constant crashes make it almost unplayable. Game patches often but they don't seem to test their patches, they often make stability worse. When it does work, the game is completely spoiled by the insane amount of cheaters. It's a rare and lucky thing if you manage to have a game where nobody is cheating. This could be a great game if they just tested their patches, stopped introducing new game-breaking bugs, and got a handle on the bloody cheaters."
"This game is still full of cheaters, gambling, and scammers. With as much money this brings valve, they should do better."
you will think hacks as obvious as shooting everyone through smoke and walls on the head will be an insta-ban. nope. everything's fine. give him an mvp.

Valve fix your damn game and get rid of the cheaters
Its good but it has a lot of cheaters :(
one of the worst games ever made
"Good going, killed a historic game for something more greedy and less evolved than the competition"
Valve is virtue signaling by blocking ads in video games but will allow children to gamble.
cs2 was the worst update in gaming history
"Net jitter makes this game unplayable. Not it's not my router, no its not my configuration, its only this game specifically at peek hours."

"Its a good game. Anti cheat doesnt work so youll have to deal with half your lobbies being cheaters whether it be walling, aimbot and spinbot if you are generally looking to do anything competitive on this you might as well play it on faceit. but they also suck ass and are rude if theres any issues. valve will never fix the cheating issue so youll just have to live with it"

"Quite possibly the most cancerous game I have ever played so bad infact that I would rather circumsize myself with a rusty bonesaw than play a single match of premier.

(gambling was fun tho)"
this game isnt very accurate guns no shoot right
Cheaters.. cheaters everywhere
"TL;DR: The ranking and matchmaking is still fundamentally broken. If you want a fair sport-like experience, official matchmaking is a horrible option.

I never make reviews like this, but this game had the straw it took to break the camels back.
I have recently been playing quite a lot of competitive Dust II with my friend who is about silver 5 (silver elite) in skill, and I'm just as good as him, if not maybe just a bit worse, being at silver 4*.

However, my actual rank the game tells me is silver 2. And the lower bracket of it from what I've seen in matches.
So to clear up the discreptancy - as the confused matchmaking would give me and my friend bad teammates - I have to play solo rounds.
Not only do I not really want to do this, because I play this game to spend time with my friend, but I constantly get matches where either: 
My teammates try yet still aren't of much help so I carry the whole game at best, 
or I get someone who's purposefully trolling at worst.

I have played six unwanted rounds in these efforts.
My final rank?
[spoiler][b]SILVER 1[/b][/spoiler]
I literally got demoted because I had one bad round with a guy who trolled with his friend the whole game.
After all of these rounds, where I'd be top of the leaderboard by a landslide every time, I got promoted in none of them.

I have spent money on this game, I have Prime. This is what I get for it?
Finally, I know what premier is of course. But I'm not interested in having to learn other maps. I just want to play the one map I like and thats that. 

*In matches where players were silver 4 and above, I'd always put up a good fight and be able to do my part for the team, so I'd say I qualify for the skill level."
This game has tons of bugs and glitches which will make you rage quit in seconds
toxic community
"CS2 has issues with its anti-cheat system because Valve mainly relies on VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat), which operates on a delayed ban system—hackers can play for weeks or even months before getting caught. Additionally, Valve heavily depends on the Overwatch system, where players review demos and manually report cheaters, but this process is slow and inefficient.

Valve doesn’t stop hackers because banned players simply buy new accounts and skins, which generates more profit for them!"
"Counter-Strike 2 — это долгожданное продолжение культовой серии шутеров от первого лица, но, к сожалению, игра не обошлась без своих недостатков. Несмотря на множество нововведений и улучшений, есть несколько аспектов, которые существенно портят впечатление от игрового процесса.

Во-первых, проблема с читерами остается актуальной. С каждым игровым матчем игроки сталкиваются с нечестной игрой, когда противники используют запрещенные программы для получения преимущества. Это создает токсичную атмосферу, которая отталкивает новых игроков и делает игру менее привлекательной. Разработчикам необходимо срочно уделить внимание системе античита, чтобы устранить этот недуг.

Во-вторых, среди игроков можно встретить множество «прокачанных» пользователей, которые благодаря помощи других игроков поднимают свои рейтинги, не обладая достаточными навыками. Это приводит к тому, что матчмейкинг становится необъективным, и новички вынуждены соперничать с опытными игроками, которые попали в их команду по обстоятельствам, а не по своим умениям. Чувство несправедливости значительно портит удовольствие от игры.

Несмотря на свои визуальные и механические улучшения, Counter-Strike 2 сталкивается с серьезными проблемами, связанными с читерами и неуместными игроками. Если разработчики смогут справиться с этими недостатками, игра сможет заново завоевать доверие и любовь фанатов. Пока же, как и во многих других играх, нужна значительная работа по улучшению баланса и безопасности игрового процесса."

"game itself is fine by now mostly, needs a lil tweeking here and there, but overall it's playable. not so much for any ranked mode, simply due to the players. ""understanding at least the basics of XXXX comes BEFORE competing in XXXX""sadly is faaaaaar beyond the mental capabilties of most players, even tho it should be basic common sense. u wanna see how brainrotten mankind has become? have a look into any ranked mode."
"Why this game sucks, if you want to play competetive normal, then you will have a lot of shit games where you can't leave, like teamate leaves, you can't vote surrender and if you leave there is a cooldown, so I can't play, if there is a cheater, you can't leave, because cooldown, so you can't play normal. Shit game, played 4 games and one  was where nobody was cheating and nobody left, but had to play all of them if I wanted to play, last one I quit as well it was 3 vs 5 and now and 30min cooldown, Valve you are stupid with this."
CS2
"CS2 was supposed to be an upgrade, but it feels more like a downgrade. Clunky movement, weird hit reg, and a ton of missing features from CS:GO. The game just doesn’t have the same feel anymore. Hopefully, they fix it, but right now, it’s a disappointment."

The game is full of cheats. 80% of players use cheats. The game is so full of cheats that it is unplayable and the developers don't even care. The developers turn a blind eye to cheating. This game is definitely not worth spending money and time on. A complete waste of time.
"whatever you do, i dont recommend touching this game. csgo/csgo2 whatever, is easily worst games in the world. maybe takes the first title on these. i have 14minutes on this game, only because i wanted do challenge to play this game 1 hour, or atleast 30mins. but i survived 14mins, and then i had to delete this game. before i vomited all over my keyboard. just... dont play this... no one does.. and there is reason why."

"700 hours. hundreds of dollars poured into this game. Final thoughts? not a great game, a mix of jank and the lack of anti cheat make the game seriously painstaking to play if you want to try to be competitive, and the new ""sub tick"" makes for some painful around the  corner deaths. It is getting better slowly, however... its not currently in a fun state."

"**Title: A Frustrating Experience – Not What It Used to Be**

**Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)**

Counter-Strike has long been a staple in competitive FPS games, but after years of playing, I’m starting to feel that it’s not the same game I used to enjoy. While the core gameplay still holds up to some extent, the overall experience has become increasingly frustrating and toxic, especially with the lack of meaningful changes to address long-standing issues.

First off, the matchmaking system is a mess. The game constantly pairs you with players who either have little to no experience or are overly aggressive, ruining the enjoyment for anyone trying to play at a more casual level. It feels like a constant grind to rank up or even have a fair match, and that’s if you can actually get into a game without encountering connection issues or endless waiting times.

The community is another major downside. While there are still great players out there, the overall toxicity in the game is overwhelming. From constant trolling and team-killing to just flat-out aggressive behavior, it makes playing the game feel more like a chore than fun. The lack of effective moderation and reporting systems only exacerbates the problem.

In terms of gameplay, it’s hard to ignore how dated some of the mechanics feel. The shooting feels clunky and punishing, and while that’s part of the “hardcore” appeal for some, it can feel frustratingly unforgiving. The maps are tired, and while there are occasional updates, it doesn’t feel like the game has progressed enough in recent years to justify the hype. I’m also disappointed by the lack of innovation compared to other FPS titles in the market.

Graphics and audio are functional but feel lackluster. Compared to modern shooters, CS:GO doesn’t stand out in terms of visual design or sound, and the constant updates seem more focused on skins and cosmetics than actual gameplay improvements.

Ultimately, Counter-Strike has lost its appeal for me. While the competitive nature is still there, the combination of frustrating matchmaking, a toxic community, and a game that feels stuck in the past makes it hard to recommend. I’ve moved on to other FPS games that offer a more balanced and enjoyable experience. It’s a classic, but it’s definitely showing its age in a way that’s hard to ignore."

"cheater game, dumb valve!"
"Mouse sensitivity depends on FPS, Ppl always vote Anubis and the other egipcian one (the maps where you get the lowest fps). I have many complains, the ping they show you is not real, I always have 50+ and they show 18, what else? a lot of tiny craps that added together makes Counter Strike 2 extremely inferior to Counter Strike Go"

"Please let the Modders release Classic Offensive!
Counter-Strike started as a modification for the original Half-Life, and by stopping a release for a modification, you are firstly doing wrong to the Community and secondly doing wrong to the CS legacy. If not for the moders you wouldn't have made billions selling skins from Counter-Strike. 
Valve please Fix!"

Nah bro games ass just do ice
GAME SUCKS   WITH  HIS  DEVS   0 RESPECT THEM
"Holy f*ck I am losing my sh*t over the case farming bots in deathmatch. Like, you can't even topscore and be in first place because as soon as you peek you get insta headshotted. Valve f*cking do something, these bots pisses me off. Can't have a warmup in deathmatch anymore, have to go onto a workshop map instead. I don't know anything about how you should run a company but thinking that this is the state of deathmatch on a *official* server is ridiculous. Like, it shouldn't be that be difficult to hire people who can develop a proper cheat detection system. And valve being valve, they have more than enough resources to hire people. Just, use your money to hire anti-cheat experts holy f*ck. A game with one of the most largest esports scene, and the company seems to be either greedy or lazy. I don't care what the valve glazers say on how we should be grateful we got this update, NO. Criticism from the community is feedback a company can use to improve the game towards what the community wants to see and change. Bringing gratitude to the argument doesn't justify any irresponsibility from the damn company."
fix .game lesss cheats
this game is very bad also it is so much lagging in my i5 processor pc i dont recomend it to anyone
if you want to play against cheaters and smurfs every game get cs2. if you want an actual game that bans cheaters and smurfs regularly get r6. csgo had its fair share of issues but this revamp is unbearable in comparison... sad to see a classic slaughtered and hung up to dry...
"BROKEN GAME...


I have never seen a game that has such a high rate of exploiters and plain cheaters. 4 games in a row, cheaters. Lost hours of time trying to find ways to beat cheaters and beat the constant bugs that are showing up. The dev team does nothing to fix the bugs either. Not even worth playing anymore. Anarchy RUST servers have less cheaters than this sh*te. DO NOT PLAY.

Not only this, but Valve makes no effort at all to upgrade / update their anti-cheat. So not only do you get skull-r*ped by a cheater... they get away with it. Worst experience of my life. If you need proof, just go to the massively popular CS cheater community on reddit. You'll find all the proof there. Over 30k people in it. Cheating. Sharing cheats. Top 4% community. Nothing gets done. 

This message is for VALVE:
FIX YOUR F*CKING GAME"
I don't know I just felt like it
playing from new acc is so hard - too many cheaters

normally i play fast pace shooter game not just slow pace hip-fire simulator where the second shot of every gun is highly innaccurate."

"I havent played this since its become cs2 yet however i find it absurd that yet again theyve changed a game and made it free to play while some of us spent  money to buy it when it was still csgo, they did this with tf2 also  and now for some reason its 46gb which no valve game ever was which is what made the games even better since you could dl them in a few min anytime you felt the need i feel betrayed, shitty move valve"
I love and hate this game at the same time

i feel like people that play counter strike only play other games as a break between counter strike games.
"CS2 is so messed up. Cheaters are everywhere, making It nearly impossible to play without Prime Status and even with Prime, It's still awful. The Anti-Cheat is useless, shots don’t register properly, and the game is full of bugs. It feels more like an unfinished beta than a real sequel to CS:GO. If Valve doesn’t step up and fix this, more legit players will quit. I think everyone would love if Valve brought back official CS:GO servers for those who want to play there or at least kept CS:GO available until CS2 is truly ready. That's my opinion but I think a lot of players would say the same. I love Counter-Strike by the way..."

Takes to long to get 1000 hours
"Barebones and rushed. You have to wonder why Valve felt the need to force this out the door while desecrating CSGO's legacy. Over a year since release and still has far less content than CSGO had. All that being said it still is far better than Valorant, but that was already true with CSGO."
horrible community
"Playing this game only gives you headaches. The developers of this game are either blind or too busy playing with their balls.
Dear DEVS! PLEASE STOP THIS NONSENSE AND BRING AN ANTI-CHEAT!"
"juego chimbo, pay to win"
bad matchmaking

my bf beats me when i throw the game D:
"Full of cheaters , Valve doesn´t give a shit , find another game"
bad gaem
What did you get the VAC band for me?
the russians make me suffer
"2/3 games have cheaters in it. If it wasnt for the skin ecosystem, this game wouldve died years ago."
Dead game 💯
"LITTLE TO NO CONTENT, BROKEN PHYSICS, BROKEN GUNS, BROKEN ECONOMY, BROKEN CHEATERS, LAG LAG DIE BEHIND WALLS, CRASH MORE, CHEATERS MORE AND MORE WHY VALVE. {VAC = Valve Allows Cheaters}"
"This game is boring and repetitive with an awful community, I only play this game to sell crates and funnel money to my tf2 gambling addiction"
full of cheaters
i fucking hate this game.Im playing as a terrorist when out of nowhere a guy from my team named nigga bob and some of his friends start blocking doors shooting at me and standing right in front of me when im shooting i died like 10 times from those guys AND IM THE ONE GETTING BANNED FOR 30 MINUTES JUST BEACUSE SOME FUCKING IDIOT STARTS STANDING IN FRONT OF ME?

"The morons at VALVE are not intelligent enough to make an anti-cheat system to catch and ban all of the cheaters in the game at every level, premier, match making or casual. Their programmers are probably some low paid illegal immigrants that have about 12 hours of programming experience total."
"When I play a game and try to change the resolution, it disconnects me. After that, I get stuck on a loading screen showing 0%, and I can’t reconnect until I assume the match is over. By the time I finally get back in, I’ve already received a cooldown penalty in CS, which I don’t think is fair—for me or my team—just because I changed my resolution."
"Hakers, griefers, depression"
best game ever!...if you are a cheater
Game is full of cheaters.
Removed the only anti-cheat the game had semi working (overwatch) and then lied to the community about adding it back. This game is infested with cheaters its been the biggest problem the game faces since launch yet valve refuse to address the fact that the current dogshit anti-cheat is completely inadequate to deal with the current cheating scene. Stop supporting this dogshit game and company they took every good feature csgo had removed it and called it a new game.
Too many russians
Katastrophka Hackius
Ill rubber band my ass off while having sh!t teammates that cant listen to simple English

"bad hit register (gunplay in general), bad optimization, bad servers annoys you while you just wanna relax and play. I hope they fix it!"

absolute cheaters game
gay shit for fags that play every day for hours a day
shit only russians
CSGO ran 400-500fps felt like butter. CS2 lucky to get 150fps on low settings. Game looks like shit and runs like shit. Fuck you valve for taking a massive dump on a otherwise amazing franchise.
bad gaming...
"I was kicked out of my computer is blocking the VAC system, I didn't know why this game is a mistake >:l"
when tdm?
very gay game
cs2 is ff'ed up. laggy as f and community servers are way too difficult to reach (surf)
Get the case and go play good games.
full of cheaters
"Bad game. Shooting feels of, lot of shots is not registered 
correctly. Movement bad. Matchmaking still lacks lot of things and is not enjoyable, premier does not make that all better. Lot of cheaters, i reported lot of very true cheaters and still no one is banned. Toxic playerbase, not of course all players, but i have guys playing who is griefing every third match even if i play good and say no bad words to other people. If you are playing alone, this game brings only dissapointment. Developers cleary supports war (you know which one...) in indirect ways which are kinda legal, but shady..... or ignore fact that lot of people bring that to the game and are toxic with that to other players, especially suffering are persons who has been affected by war. CS GO was bad, but cs2 upgrade doesn't make game better at all."
shitty game shitty anti cheat csgo better
Its a good game but has hackers and you end up gambling. DO NOT GET this shit.
someone check my pulse
"either there is a cheater in the enemy team every game or a russian 6yo who slept with my mom

Cheater-Strike 2
vac isnt working
"1.-Get Stuck in a wingman with a wallhack cheater (he has fresh account of course) that just wallbangs with Negev and AWP
2.-You cant surrender the game with your bro (game dosent't let you for no fucking reason) so you can jump in another match and actually have fun
3.-Try to constantly kill yourself to actually finish that match and finally jump in a game where you dont die 5sec after spawning.
4.-Get banned for two hours for trying to end the game early
5.-Now after the pain of being stuck in the most frustrating game, you can't play a normal and fair one cuz Valve fucked you in the ass with spiked strapon
6.-Cheater wins and probably laughs his ass off in front of his screen from me being banned"
Freezing. Made me lose a lot of rank because game crashed several times and I was not able to reenter the games.

"Racism and Cheating are what you will 100% experience by playing this game. Please fix this issue and stop allowing people to use wall hacks in lower elo. ITS A BAD EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE.

I SERIOUSLY THINK THE DEVS OF THIS GAME DON'T CARE IF SOMEONE IS RACIST OR CHEATING. ANYTHING FOR THE MONEY. I HOPE YOU GET WHAT'S COMING TO YOU."

"Worst version of CS. valve developers can't make good games. Cs:go wasn't made by valve(it was founded by another company). CS:S was downgrade compare to cs 1.6. Cheaters everywhere, farming bots, radarhackers and matchfixers in a pro scene, bad network, horrible sub-tick, bad optimization, toxic low iq community, skin slots without age restriction. VAC doesn't exist at this point. I would rather play CS Classic and it will be better than this clown-fiesta."
fix your game valve
"I love the game and CS in general but i just cannot in good faith give this a positive review until a few basic criteria are met.

A working anti-cheat

128 tick over sub-tick

more maps and game modes 

after we get these thing this will probably be the best shooter on the market but until then its alright at best."

"I love this game. I've been playing it on and off since it's first release as CS:GO and it was my go to online fps with friends. Sadly it is impossible for me to recommend this game in this state because it's riddled with cheaters, griefers, open racism and harrasment and so on... If you are willing to play this game you need to be ready for not just a cheater or multiple cheaters in enemy team and also in your team... most of the time the chat (both text and voice) will be filled with racist, sexist slurs (some will just send swatikas in the chat here and there, no context). You also won't get any feedback on your reports so there is no way of knowing if the person is banned or not (or if their account was even reviewed). There are many known cheater accounts (you can find some on Youtube and then double check their account on steam) that are still unbanned and enjoying CS:2 with the rest of us. The game needs some strict regulation and an anti-cheat. Get your shit together..."
"Too many cheaters, but great if u wanna develop a gambling addiction!"

"The cancer that kills Valve from the inside
Everything for the skin casinos, soft NFTs of random value generators, don't touch the server browser your games desparately need updating, surf maps killed, casual now 5v5 so what is the point? Everything must be esports or fit the mold, no more fun allowed.
The smallest freebie they could give to the community is just let private matchmaking give XP for those skin drops, for steam groups (oh you remember those do you Valve?). The fact they don't is entirely to try and curb bot farms I imagine, just to keep the skin market from crashing. Pathetic.
We could have had the days of janky func_vehicle map mechanics. We  could have fun maps intended for 10v10 clusterfucks throwing grenades and pushing chokes Valve could have made money solely from armory passes and the gameplay could entirely be ours."
"[h1]Don't waist your time[/h1]

[h3]Actual gameplay is not bad[/h3]
And is pretty fun, at least for such casual player as I am. I've been playing CS actively since GO, but also played 1.6 and Source.

- As far as content goes, I want to see more old maps, specifically Business Center or however it was called from CSGO.
- It also wasn't fun to loose all the achievements after GO and don't have anything in return besides the single stub.
- Bots are stupid. Like much more stupid than was in Source. And there is no real way to configure them. I believe there was an option in CSGO, which doesn't works now.
- There is also no more way to pick a specific map in casual, only groups, which is a bit annoying.
- Other than that, the game can be addictive, which is worth to notice if you can have issue with that.

[h3]However, in the last years the game becomes more and more unplayable[/h3]
- It starts with [b]random VAC timeouts[/b] in the middle of an interesting match, which will immediately kick you out and not let to join a new one until something is done. I've had those almost daily recently. This specific issue requires reinstall of the game (whole 50Gb with my poor Internet connection) and reboot of my PC. There is no way to affect that other to have a better connection to lose less time when (not if) that happens.
- Then, there are [b]cheaters[/b]. Like quite a lot, but not very often. But yeah, VAC and the stupid timeout issue won't stop them.
- After some recent updates I also have [b]random complete freezes[/b] almost every match after a while. My PC isn't total crap, I play on minimal graphics, I have perfect connection at the time it happens and I also don't see not even a bit of spike in RAM or CPU usage. Also, this is the only game where it happens and it's constant enshitification over the last years made me almost sure that the game itself is the issue."
too many cheaters smh valve fix game
This shit ass game made me realise that I hate multiplayer fps games. Yes I'm VAC banned. And yes I also suck at this game.

"Horrible game. I have a ping of 10 and can run it at 144 fps with ease at 3840x2160 but it seems like I have a ping of 80. I can put a mag into someone and they survive. Someone appears around a corner and as soon as I see them I am dead. There are obviously good players but you can see some with high kill ratios and they can actually miss the shot and they still get a kill. 



I have tried everything to change this. autoexec, played with settings and FPS. Nothing makes any difference.  

Then the game is littered with cheats and it looks uncontrolled. 

I had 50 hours of utter frustration and will now uninstall."

"Way too many cheaters and bug on this game.
Playing cs since 1.5 and I've never seen so many cheaters on this game. 
Since cs2 premiere mode is full of cheaters. No obvious spinbot.
Just 90% of my oponnent have between 5 and 40 friends. Move like beginner. 
Do dumbs moves and don't know the basics but hit a lot of hs and know where we go.
Look like playing in 5 vs 8... They are 4 players everywhere.

One thing: when I play with friends(so no cheat with me) we hardly win.
When I play with random I win 80% of my game.
I have a guess: CSGO had 10% cheaters. Look like cs2 have more like 20/30% cheaters or more.
So if I play with 4 mates we have no cheat... Cheaters can only be in the other team. 
But if I soloQ I have 4/9 chances to have a cheater with me."

I wish I could get back the money I spent on buying the license for this game, worst mistake of my life, dont try this unless you are a virgin, an idiot, or just no hope in life left but dont wanna kill yourself, instead you want to make your worthless life even worse."

the only reason that still makes this game worthy of playing is the weekly drops and the trading besides that bot farming accounts hackers and greifers that will vote you out even if you top frag just because they can and lots of ego full people too that want to argue for no reason. besides that sometimes it is fun with friends  time to time and the mechanics  are pretty solid but if you love your sanity do yourself a favour and play something actually enjoyable but to each their own

Matches in premier are riddled with cheaters, most of which i have definitive proof are walling and still Valve wont even just buy anti cheats. Anything is better than VAC at this point. 

Valve made hundred of millions off of case openings alone, this doesnt factor in Armory or even the % they take off of marketplace. WE DESERVE BETTER."

Hacking dogs everywhere. Video on Youtube showing top players in the world hacking with skins. Which means they don't fear being banned. Which means valve is doing fuck all to kerb the cheater problem. Thanks Gaben!
"This game is dead asf if you are not cheating you are not going to get far. Even pros are exhausted of this trash company and their non working antic-cheat and quiting the game for it. I've seen players cheat like there's no tomorrow and they are not getting banned and just cause I tried to keep up with my games and start winning some with the same way my opponents did, I get banned and note I didn't even cheat the way those other people did. Not even as close as them and still got banned for it. Maybe if one day they remove all hackers from this game then I'll remove my review and recommend it for others to play it. Till then, don't touch this game, it will cause you mental issues :)"

I installed CS2 with dreams of hitting Global, but instead, I hit rock bottom. 💔

🔴 2nd round: our ""AWPer"" is holding B site with a P90 and zero brain activity.
🔴 3rd round: a Level 2 Faceit account headshots me through smoke while bhopping backward.

— ""Don't worry bro, it's just game sense."" 🧑‍🎓

MY BROTHER IN CHRIST, YOU'RE STREAMING WALLHACKS.

By round 5, my entire team is either griefing, AFK, or arguing in five different dialects of Russian. The only English words I hear:
👉 ""ez lose""
👉 ""go next""
👉 ""cyka cyka cyka""

Meanwhile, I'm over here in a 1v5 clutch, heart pounding, palms sweaty, holding onto the last shreds of my sanity. I line up the shot… AND SUDDENLY:

⚠️ CONNECTION LOST TO GAME SERVER ⚠️

Valve Anti-Cheat has detected that your opponent is using software assistance.

Me: Finally, justice!
Valve: The match has been canceled. You lose 25 ELO.

At this point, I uninstall the game, walk outside, touch grass, and get hit by a pollen allergy attack so severe that I respawn in my own room.

10/10 experience, would suffer again. 😭

Right now game is unplayable. Every 2 match you can encounter either a wallhack or some other funny feature player. Only way to play cs2 right now is faceit. Till valve didnt do anything about cheaters i do not recommend playing on that game.

Inflated player base by bot farms, this game is dying a fast death, would be faster if not for all the artificial build up. STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!!!!!!!"
The concept of the game is great. But it has become a shit game with cheaters. I do not think the game developers can not solve the issue with cheaters while Faceit team doing it great. I think if the developers solve the problem with cheaters the large amount players stop playing it which is huge minus for Valve in terms of money and so on.
What happened to this game man
Shit game full of hackers
not enough waifus...
"Personally, I found CS:GO better than CS2. Cheaters are in almost every round, especially if you play in the upper Elo."

FUCK THIS SHITTY GAME BAN ALL THE HACKERS YOU FUCKING NIGGERS I HATE THIS SHIT WORST GAME EVER
Absolutely full of cheaters...all the time. Do not recommend
This game is the worst version of our beloved game!
Dog shit game every game has cheaters but VAC banning normal players.. dead game

Just cheater infested
"Literally only cheaters, you need to get faceit to not have cheaters in."
"Too few people, too many bots."
too many hack
always has issues loading and. works 70% in 1080
downgrade from csgo
RENAME THIS SHIT GAME TO FUCKING CC (CHINESE AND CHEATERS BECAUSE THATS THE ONLY FAGGOTS THAT PLAY THIS SHIT)
"cheaters still up, i have reported them, and they still playing"
"This game Is trash. The Matchmaking System Is terrible and barely works, micro-transactions are awful, visually looks mediocre compared to the older games. the gun-play plays and feels half-baked, cheaters are everywhere In this game. etc; This game Is an absolute disgrace and should've been completely separate instead of replacing an already functional game? Even though I never liked Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Counter-Strike 2 Is an Terrible experience. Just play 1.6 or Source even if those two games have almost dead servers."
csgo better
"The game is full of cheaters. Every single game you will run into a cheater. vac will unban cheaters for a second chance to what?"" cheat better maybe. Who knows. 42 billion dollar skin market. $5 anti cheat"
za duzo cheaterow
shit
"killed the game and served me its corpse, calling it an ‘engine upgrade’"
nothing
"Many work on the game still needed, I've been in many matches where someone leaves before 3rd round and still the whole team has to lose the same amount of prem points. No remake system at all. Cheaters also a big issue still I've seen the craziest cheaters people on nuke fully shooting through walls/roofs with ssg or revolver without any VAC thing seeing this happen when its obvious as hell. The only good thing rn about the game is the skins honestly."
"horrible people play this game, people flexing that they have cheats and hacks"
bad notvery good lost all money to cases curse steam !
dfgdfgdfgdgdd
"Cheaters, cheater cheaters.  It  should be one of the greatest fps  of all time, but it's filled with toxic players and wanna be pro.  So what do they do?  After they loose pistol round, they turn their wall and aim bots on and  3 round later have 14-1 K/d ratio.  It's great to practice reflexes, until your realise you don't stand a chance. And the game devs aren't  either banning any of them or doing anything substantial about the cheating issues. So think twice before sinking time and money into this game. If you are to play it, get a second party launcher witch will minimised your chance of encountering cheaters, but even then, you still will. besides trying to take your money, I don't think they care at all about anything else."
God this game sucks.
"This is hot garbage, but i can't stop playing it"
my game wont open now ima get ban for a mouth

when reporting cheaters it does not affect nothing

if its not them, it's little Putin kids keeps shouting and killing teammates for no reason.

game keeps crushing after few games without reason, and i need to reset pc everytime
now i cant get into game, after playing few hours it kicked me in premier mode
it will be 'my fault' that the game crushed....... 

for a game that enters tens of millions a month, you would expect something better."
"Unplayable. Very poorly optimized to lower level rigs, therefore its completely unplayable to a good chunk of people. The vastly superior league of legends and vastly smarter, more intuitive, and creative development and ownership team win out against the lowly, lazy valve. ONLY PLAY IF YOU WANT AT LEAST 100 MS AND CONSTANT JITTER."
fuck this game and fuck valve
I'm going up against people who have thousands of hours who have been playing since 2019 and sweat hard and exploit mechanics while i'm just trying to play casually. You'd think a basic matchmaking system would be on your list but I guess not
"MASSIVELY disappointed. Game keeps crashing or becoming unresponsive. I've tried everything YouTube, Google, Reddit, or the Steam Community can advise. Sucks."
No escape from gambling lil bro
"[NEW REVIEW]
You replaced CS:GO entirely with 2 instead of creating a new version and keeping the previous one as well. It's good we still got CS 1.6 to play since CS2 is not working.
At the same time you removed CS:GO without even coming up with a macOS version for CS2. No mention of dropping macOS whatsoever.
You also lied about the game ""Coming this summer"", but it was released on 28 of September. Transparency needs to improve at Volvo.

Also: Gabe Follower is the biggest clown in the CS community.

[OLD REVIEW]
Pretty good. You hate it, but you come back to it eventually."

This game is just full of cheaters. You try to rank up but then you get hit by cheaters and you fall back in ranking...
"Matchmaking in this game is the worst I have ever seen. 1/10, I don't know why anyone likes this, but my friends enjoy it somehow.
Also, I have a lot of jitter, this is the only game I have ever had network issues in the last 3 years."
booooooo
"Since it is free and full of freeloaders, 
since Russian players can't speak English, because their ego can't accept the fact that their language sucks and will never be international, 
since there is tons of cheaters who can't get banned becouse Steam loves them for playing and for buying games, 
this game turned out to be a Piece of a Shit. Trust the guy who was playing CS: 1.5 more than 20 years ago."
too many russians
More cheaters everyday.
"I know its still in development but a massive downgrade from csgo. Cheaters, sub tick exc."
fuck you purple
"Absolutely terrible video game, issues from day 1 that remain unfixed. Avoid at all costs. Low quality money grab scheme."
"Hackers everywhere its hilarious, just get on Face it, i've never seen such a huge amount of cheaters in a game, fucking Tarkov might even have less cheaters lmao, but when you get a fair game its so different and feels pretty good."
I CANT DEAL WITH THE TRASH SERVERS LIKE MY OING IS SO BAD PLUS DONT LET ME GET STARTED ABOUT THE NET JITTER I CANT PLAY PREMIER BECAUSE I GET TELEPORTED EVERY 0.221 SEC LIKE PLS MAN FIX THIS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"There are too many cheaters, and Valve can't find any solution. Why aren't hardware bans applied to players detected using cheats? A cheater has to get caught in Overwatch, receive a cheating conviction, and get their account banned. Then, they'll just buy another prime account for a few bucks and continue ruining our games. Since Valve isn't addressing this issue, every player over 30 that I've talked to believes Valve itself is the one releasing these cheats. Until Valve finds a definitive solution to cheating, all non-cheating CS2 players should boycott Valve."
you will become a gambling addict
got vac banned for no reason and they dont even tell me why i got banned and i cant even sell my fucking skins to refund my money that i spend in this shitty full of cheater fucking game 10/10 game with very good support and anti-cheat <33333 !!!!

"Counter-Strike 2: A Love Letter to Wallhacks, Spinbots, and the Glorious Chinese Gaming Renaissance

Counter-Strike. Two words that conjure memories of late nights fueled by Mountain Dew, frantic keyboard mashing, and the existential dread of being headshot by a ten-year-old with reflexes faster than a caffeinated hummingbird. And now, we have Counter-Strike 2, a shiny new coat of paint on the same addictive, frustrating, and utterly captivating formula.

But CS2 is more than just a graphical update. It's a cultural phenomenon, a social experiment, and, most importantly, a testament to the boundless creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of… certain segments of the Chinese gaming community.

Let's be honest, folks. Counter-Strike, in its purest form, is a game of skill, strategy, and lightning-fast reflexes. But for some players, particularly those hailing from the land of pandas and questionable internet cafes, the thrill of victory isn't enough. They crave domination. They yearn for supreme power. And they're willing to… explore alternative avenues to achieve their goals.

Enter the glorious world of wallhacks, aimbots, and spinbots. These aren't mere cheats, my friends. They're works of art. They're digital symphonies of destruction, composed with the precision of a neurosurgeon and the subtlety of a jackhammer.

Imagine, if you will, a quiet CS2 match on Dust II. The tension is palpable. The air is thick with anticipation. And then, out of nowhere, a figure emerges from T spawn, his crosshair locked onto your skull with the unwavering accuracy of a guided missile. He spins around like a demented ballerina, mowing down your entire team with inhuman precision.

Is this a skilled player? Perhaps a prodigy blessed with superhuman reflexes?

No, my friends. This is a Chinese gamer on a mission. He is an artist, a visionary, a master of the digital dark arts. He is… the Spinbot Samurai.

And let's not forget the Wallhack Wizards. These cunning strategists possess the uncanny ability to see through walls, anticipating your every move with the clairvoyance of a fortune teller. They know where you're hiding, what weapon you're using, and whether you had pizza for dinner last night.

How do they do it? Magic? Espionage? A secret pact with the Illuminati?

Nah. They just downloaded a free program from some shady Russian website. But hey, who are we to judge their methods? They're just embracing the technological advancements of the 21st century.

But the true genius of the Chinese cheating scene lies not in the hacks themselves, but in the sophistication of their denial. Oh, they'll vehemently deny any wrongdoing, even as they're blatantly wallbanging you through three walls with a Desert Eagle.

""No, no, I'm just very lucky!"" they'll exclaim in broken English, their voices dripping with feigned innocence. ""I have good gaming chair! And I drink much Gamer Supps!""

And if you dare to accuse them of cheating, prepare for a torrent of abuse and insults that would make a sailor blush. They'll accuse you of being a ""noob,"" a ""hater,"" and a ""racist pig."" They'll threaten to hack your computer, dox your family, and send you pictures of… well, let's just say things you wouldn't want to see before breakfast.

It's truly a sight to behold. The sheer audacity, the unwavering confidence, the unbridled rage… it's like watching a Shakespearean tragedy unfold in real time, only with more racial slurs and less iambic pentameter.

Now, some might argue that cheating is wrong. That it ruins the integrity of the game. That it's unfair to honest players who are trying to climb the ranks through hard work and dedication.

But I say, poppycock! Cheating adds a certain… je ne sais quoi to the CS2 experience. It's like a spicy chili pepper sprinkled on a bland plate of oatmeal. It injects a dose of chaos, unpredictability, and sheer, unadulterated hilarity into an otherwise predictable game.

Besides, let's be honest, trying to outsmart a cheater is a skill in itself. It's like playing chess against a computer that can see ten moves ahead. You have to think outside the box, anticipate their moves, and exploit their weaknesses. It's a mental workout that will sharpen your mind and prepare you for the challenges of the real world.

And let's not forget the economic benefits of the Chinese cheating industry. Think about it. These talented programmers are creating jobs, stimulating the economy, and providing a valuable service to gamers who are… less skilled than others. They're the unsung heroes of the digital age!

Of course, Valve, the benevolent overlords of Counter-Strike, are constantly trying to crack down on cheating. They ban thousands of accounts every day, update their anti-cheat systems, and even resort to… gasp… hiring actual human beings to monitor the game.

But the Chinese cheaters are always one step ahead. They're like cockroaches – you can spray them with pesticide, but they'll just evolve and come back strong."
"The game is awesome crap, there is no point in buying prime status, because there are not much fewer cheaters than in regular cs. In recent months the situation has become much worse. Cheaters are found in almost every game, with macros, aim settings or whatever. My advice, which will save you time, nerves and money: buy Prime only when a new anti-cheat comes out, not earlier. Or you can try it on Faceit."
add fucking overwatch and ban all cheaters not add new skins clowns
...asd

FULL OF CHEATERS
the game sucks ...........too overrated :(
Remove anubis from premier s2 then it would be better
Valve let go of this game and instead off making better game or anticheat they focused on getting richer with skins no csgo was better all the way now its just a trash game that developers dont even fix instead they release new skins to get money

"-1 star , unplayable game full of cheaters that valve won`t bother to fix."
"the most dogshit game ive seen, anticheat non existent , go spin"
sadly almost every game has a cheater.
I've been playing cs go/cs2 for 10 years. You will have cheaters in every 3 or 4-th game. Too many cheaters to enjoy competetive matchmaking. And if they can't fix it for 10 years - they will never do it. So there is no point to play this game competetive anymore.
VAC 3.0 IS AMAZING!
Full of cheaters shit game. dont waste ur time on this shit game
"🚨 Cheating Epidemic

The anti-cheat system (VAC) is completely broken. Every other game is infested with blatant cheaters — wallhacks, aimlocks, you name it. Mass reporting does nothing, and it’s painfully obvious that the system is either not working or not being monitored properly. Meanwhile, competitors like Valorant have managed to create far more effective anti-cheat systems — so why hasn’t Valve? If a free-to-play game is going to survive, anti-cheat HAS to be a priority.

🌍 Toxic Environment and Trolls

The community is more toxic than ever. Every match seems to have at least one griefer or troll ruining the experience for everyone else — and yet, no meaningful moderation exists. The vote kick system is abused constantly, and players using racial slurs or griefing matches face no real consequences. There’s no accountability, no consequences — and it shows.

🎯 Broken Matchmaking and Hit Registration

The sub-tick system has made the gameplay feel inconsistent and unreliable. You can shoot first and still die. Peeking feels like a gamble, and hit registration is frustratingly inconsistent. High ping abusers and regional matchmaking issues only make things worse.

💀 Valve — Fix Your Game

Counter-Strike is too important to the FPS world to be left in this state. The player base deserves a working anti-cheat, better matchmaking, and actual consequences for toxicity and cheating. Valve needs to take these issues seriously — otherwise, players will continue migrating to other games that actually care about the competitive experience.

Verdict: Counter-Strike 2 has the potential to be the best FPS in the world — but only if Valve decides to stop treating it like a cash cow and starts investing in fixing the core issues. Until then, it’s hard to recommend this game to anyone serious about competitive play"

The addiction is worse than with gambling or alcohol! And the servers are full with people who run on 2 brain cells
"If you're thinking of installing this, I'll tell you something. I spent more than a thousand hours on this joke and I deeply regret it. I could have used this time for something productive if someone told me to let it go. Go do something that adds to your life, don't install this crap."
I miss when Counter-Strike was just a game a not a way for developers to make cash off gambling addicts.
"Counter strike 2, the  game where you can get the first couple shots on a guy and still die"

"I know not much hours played on this game, but i can say im decent. also i don't have prime, so because of that i get soo many cheaters. it would be really good if they fixed their anti cheat, in non-prime ofc."
"You can't play this game, You can't play any game mode without a cheater in the lobby, Game is full of players with 200 hours or less and they can kill you 9/10 times even if you have 10 times more hours and that happens all the time, Cheats are available ANYWHERE and WallHack is more common than ever! Playing this game makes me wanna delete it more and more."
why
Game is currently full of blatant cheaters and valve seemingly doing nothing
"Great game, ruined by cheaters

CS2 has solid gameplay, but the cheating problem makes it almost unplayable. VAC is useless—nearly every match has blatant or closet cheaters. The rare game without them is usually a stomp, likely because the cheater is on your team instead. The only way to enjoy CS2 is on Faceit, where their anticheat actually works. Until Valve fixes this, matchmaking is a waste of time."

Even office and italy are unplayable now. You cant get your weekly cases without pain in the ass.
Yey!"
cant get good at this game
If you wanna deal with constant cheaters ( or you wanna become one((hope you rot if you do))) its a great game! Reporting a cheater takes too long to resolve so you can be able to enjoy the game. By the time it gets sorted you've lost all will to play the game. Its an amazing game with great details and graphics. If they resolve the hacking issues its gonna be the best ever. Until then...stay away as its a waste of energy and nerves.
you play 1hr to tie most games
Infested with cheaters. On all the ranks. Valve decides to do nothing about it and ruins the game for everybody.
Gives me low trust because im smurfing on terrible cs players when im immortal 1 in valorant

CS2 is a f*cking joke
"The anti-cheat in Counter-Strike 2 is absolutely terrible. Every single match has at least one or two hackers ruining the game. It feels like the developers don’t care about maintaining a fair competitive environment. No matter how much you report, nothing changes. If you’re looking for a fair and fun FPS experience, this isn’t it. Stay away until they fix the cheating problem."

"[h1] The worst most popular video game [/h1]
This game [b]shouldn't[/b] be alive no more, we are letting this company get away with zero effort content while the servers are on fire and the ""anti-cheat"" is non-existent.
These issues have been there for years, and it just keeps getting worse.. 

Game kept alive with tournaments and the fact that everyone will lose their ""hard earned"" money if the game economy dies. Cheaters have always been there, they just moved from community servers to playing premier when it came out. Probably 9/10 matches have at least one of them, with the exploits possible nowadays, you wont be able to even tell (perfect silent, etc.).

Content wise all we have gotten past 5 years is small map changes and more ways to dry out people's wallets (Armory). 

This is just the beginning of it, i would be here writing for the next 2 years if i tried to list everything wrong with this game, if you value your mental health at all, stay away from this game and its toxic n idiotic community."

I do not recommend buying it, even though it used to be my favorite game."
Too Much Russians and german kids that love to tk
cheater world
piece of shit game with a non existent anti cheat
"Unplayable nowadays, too infested with cheaters."
"If you love hacking and not getting banned play this game, they literally don't care."
if you arent ready to start blatantly cheating you wont like it.
"Cheaters in every match, even casual. impossible to play the classic gamemodes, best gamemode is arms race. valve needs to fix the anti cheat or this game will become unplayable for anyone not cheating."
dosent work at all
new account to play with friends trying to level up but its cheaters everygame
how is this game playable when cheaters are all over the place lol
Just bouth a Premier and got a FUCKING BAN FOR 7 DAYS LIKE KYS

There's thing called VAC and i keep getting it. There's a lot of cheaters
Purely based on luck.
Brain root!
I love getting RAPED by cheaters in this game
too many cheats
"I've been playing the Counter-Strike franchise since 1999 (yes, I'm soon 40 yo), and I've loved the game so much, and I've had so much fun in it. But this version of the game, is the worst I have experienced. The game mechanics is good, with the smokes and stuff. But the shooting (with subtick) is just not as good as CS:GO.

But the biggest problem is the lack of anti cheat, and the amount of cheaters in the game. Almost every single premier game has either one or multiple cheaters, and it just completely destroys the experience for the rest of us. Valve is not doing anything about it, and I would not recommend new players to play it. You're better off playing Valorant.

Would not recommend until Valve does something about the cheaters."
"over 8000hrs 

could be a game, would be a game...

but controlled by money grubbing freaks that dont care about the community

"Semi rage cheaters and wallhackers are not detected by Valve sercure servers.
The current trust factor system is awful, it matches you up with and against cheaters.
If you have a cheater in your team and you want to kick him at the end of the match you'll get a cooldown.
if you grief the cheater you'll get a cooldown.
if you have cheaters against you and you're afk you're getting cd for 14 days.
if you report a cheater your trust factor decreases
The report button is useless unless it's for griefing reports.
Patch notes and ""major updates"" are awful, it's like valve putting the ""Anti cheat"" at the bottom of their priority."

Whenever I want to play it must be a cheater in the match no matter what"
I cannot start the game and connected to the game sever. But my internet is fine. It's been the whole day. And there is no solution found on the internet. I am tired of fixing problems. I feel so disappointed.
fck case farmers
New players dont play this game cause very toxic teammates comes in match and they just kicked you from the match for no reason.
Cheaters GALORE !! Valve fix ur game

"I've played CS casually for years, and more seriously recently. It's really fun, but it's being ruined by cheaters. Valve, please fix this, this is a great game. Just take on the cheating problem: you have the money."
i want that csgo was a sepparate game
Up 12-7 and a random teammate goes AFK. Stays AFK for 2 rounds and CS2 gives him the bomb on 12-9. I kill him to get the bomb and insta-kicked with a 30 minute cooldown.
"Riddled with cheaters, do not bother playing until they add a anti cheat. I've been play for over 20k hours be tween this account and my main. Reached global and 20k premier elo. Its just unplayable unless you get faceit.

I shouldn't have to download a third party anticheat to be able to play your game. Fix it and restore CS or return CSGO."
a lot cheater
Very bad very rude
bad optimization
"Game after game, cheater after cheater. No visible interest in getting rid of them."
cheater everywhere
Game full of cheaters !! Do not give your money to valve until they fix their anti cheat
"As a new player who really gave this game a chance i can comfortably say this is the worst game i have ever played. There are so many hackers, too many Russians and this games and zero anti-cheat.

10/10 would still probably play again"
game is ass no one should play this shit game...
e
It's just not a good game
No ducking. game sucks.
"RANT WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Needs its own platform against cheaters, while steam refuses to acknowledge the ongoing problem and, frankly if you want to waste time. Its fun, its fine, but you'll never know if its fair or not. Terribly saddening news.

Q: can you still somewhat joke with cruel or dark sarcasm?

A: Sadly, this is about the only pillar of enjoyment left. And i get it. Its something you can come to for those things that often help relieve stress. 

However, if you're absolutely a person rooted in fair things, for fair play. This game just isn't for you, and only a few good things remain in the pc gaming world. 

Things just keep dying on us, it's time for a change. Perhaps its beyond what the hard working people at valve have come to realize that fromSoftware, is really, thee only piece of nostalgia for gamer's around the globe. 

=IT'S SO SAD IN 2025=
*Riot has failed to perma release a game to the public online* (will riot just keep making LoL champions forever?)
*Call of duty instead of remaking a Modern warfare 2* we got buy our expansion set before we get bought by Microsoft.
*And now the backbone of every FPS is now due for its own client while valve wants to do things like make its own OS. 

It was fun at times though. :']
 
edit: and to clarify they have just as bad of a problem with queue imbalance as well at times players can be dead ass in the water, near certain that someone is cheating. Numerous Reddit articles tying in the same information in the frame, its just absolutely sad."

"Honestly, even since this game became free to play, it has been a downward spiral. I have multiple account, and have a peak rank at supreme. I used to love this game, but honestly at this point it's just not worth it to play anymore with all of the cheaters, the dogwater tick rate / tick system and the new CS2 dogwater systems + mechanics. Go play something else and abandon the idea of playing this shit."

2 - 4/5 cheaters
3 - try to kick one
4 - vote cancelled
5 - you get kicked
If Valve does not do anything about this i will not touch this game again . Either they introduce hardwired bans , meaning anyone with more than 3 banned accounts on their pc gets permanently banned from using steam on  this exact computer OR  special ban features are distributed among trusted players AKA people like me can ban an account INSTANTLY . Why even bother making a game when you cant even make it enjoyable for anyone ??? 
Sincerely to Valve : Go fuck yourselves <3"

"VAC = Valve allows cheaters.

"They gotta actually focus on the game, and focus on what makes CS great.. Its clear that there is a huge lag in the content of the game, its legit carried by the community."
To many cheaters and the way the new trust factor works punishes new players.

The game is full of cheaters. Impossible to play in a serious way.

matchmaking is trash and one sided. wither you crush or get crushed.  enabling 11yr olds to gam3le.  one of the last games to encourage  this filth.  making 100mil a yr so of course they encourage kids
"CS:GO was better, should be able to revert and play the old game. Other than that, CS2 made everything about CS:GO worse not even the same engine so it is a different game, still buggy thoughhh. AND a bad Anti-Cheat, have fun playing if you don't have prime. Don't wanna play cheaters? Then it is NOT a free game. Shame Valve only care about money like every other triple A developer now."

no good
"fix ur game weirdos. i tried to play my first game of comp and alt/tabed out to pause music. CS2 decided to not let me back in the game. i asked later and my friends said they have the same issue. i looked on reddit and found a bunch of people with the same problem. guess what, NO FIX. I didn't spend $0 on this game for it to not work. fix ur game lazy devs"
I DO NOT RECOMMEND beacuse of well knows issues such as I hit a guy 4 times and he doesnt falls he hits me once and Im dead it happens so often you just want to delete a game and never touch it again.
prime and premier matchmaking is a joke there are a lot of cheaters and vac ban doesnt work -rep and -aura for valve and cs2
dog shit
"Counter-Strike 2—oh, where do I even begin? From the moment we locked eyes on the title screen, it felt like a whirlwind romance was about to unfold. The clean, refined visuals promised a relationship built on trust and transparency, and I was more than ready to take the plunge.

The first time I held an AK-47 in this updated beauty of a game, it was like slipping my hand into a lover's—a perfect fit. The gunplay, sharp and intimate, feels like the tender brush of fingers on my cheek, reminding me that every shot must be purposeful. CS2 doesn’t just demand precision; it courts it, seducing you into a dance where every movement matters.

And oh, the maps! Revisiting Dust2 felt like coming home to an old flame, the kind you never quite got over. But Counter-Strike 2 has taken that nostalgic love and given it a glow-up—like they’ve been hitting the gym and reading poetry in their downtime. The lighting, the reflections, the subtle yet striking textures—it’s as if the game wants to say, ""I’ve changed, but I’m still yours.""

But it’s not all about looks. Underneath that polished surface lies a heart brimming with care. The revamped smoke grenades? They’re like the mystery of a first kiss—filling the air between us, blurring the lines of what’s real and imagined. The way the particles swirl and react dynamically to bullets and grenades is almost... poetic. It’s as if the game is whispering, ""Every detail, every action—you’re a part of my story.""

And let’s not forget the community. Playing with friends feels like a group date, and even the strangers I meet online—well, some of them are less charming than others. But every now and then, there’s that one teammate. The one whose voice crackles through comms, giving callouts with a calm confidence that makes your heart race. You clutch together in a 2v5, every kill a synchronized step closer to triumph. By the time the defuse timer ticks down to zero, you’re not just teammates—you’re something more.

Of course, no romance is perfect. There are the occasional lag spikes, the matchmaking hiccups, the times when the matchmaking gods seem determined to test your patience. But isn’t that the beauty of love? The imperfections make it real.

So here’s to Counter-Strike 2—a game that feels like a lover who knows all your quirks and flaws but challenges you to be better every day. Whether we’re rushing B or holding mid, I’ll always come back to you, my pixelated paramour.

Forever yours,"
cheater infested garbage
The games would be better without russians :DDD
NO fun in playing the game just filled with hackers and not an enjoyable experience if you want a similar game i would recommend Valorant
"Cheaters are ruining CS2. Despite promises of better anti-cheat, wallhacks, aimbots, and spin-bots are everywhere, even in Premier mode. The reporting system feels useless, and VAC doesn’t seem to catch them fast enough. Without a serious fix, the competitive experience is frustrating and unfair."
NEEEGGGERRR
This game does not make you a happy person. Everyone I know becomes evil after touching this game.
so many cheaters... so many!

"its fine as long as you dont take it seriously. every time you shoot a bullet valve servers quickopen a case and if you pull a factory new your shot connects. it is just random. to get out of silver expect to play 1200hrs + because its the sweatiest game there is. there is no new content. except from that, its fine. dont loose money on cases, though. the csgo vibes are not there anymore"

I got 16GB DDR5 ram, i5 12450H and RTX 3050 6GB variant and I am not sure why it's happening so I would be leaving a negative review for now. The casual mode is quite enjoyable for me but it would be nice if the game didn't crash every 30 mins."
i dont like
:/
"Not Recommended!

1. Optimization & Bugs
The game launched with absolutely terrible optimization. Even with a powerful PC, I experienced stuttering, sudden FPS drops, and random lag. Performance issues on low and medium settings are common. In 2025, I didn’t expect to deal with such problems in a game that has existed for so long. Sure, I understand that the game is still under development, but when even navigating the main menu feels sluggish, that’s just unacceptable.

2. Graphics & Sound
The visual improvements are minimal. Yes, textures are slightly more detailed, and the lighting is better, but at its core, it’s just CS:GO with a slightly polished look, running on the Source 2 engine. If you were expecting a revolutionary upgrade, prepare for disappointment. The game world still looks like something from the early 2010s.
Weapon sounds aren’t great either. They lack realism and don’t provide the punchy, satisfying feedback that was present in CS:GO. Overall, the sound design feels outdated, especially compared to modern shooters, where audio is much more immersive and impactful.

3. Gameplay & Mechanics
Some mechanics have been tweaked, but they don’t result in meaningful improvements. Many elements that worked well in CS:GO remain unchanged and now feel outdated. Movement, shooting—everything feels like a slightly modified version of old mechanics rather than something truly innovative. This isn’t a step forward; it’s a sidestep at best.

4. Game Modes & Content
There are no significant new features in CS2. The same maps, the same modes. Incredibly little content at launch Even basic additions like fresh maps or unique modes that weren’t in CS:GO are completely missing. That’s a major disappointment.

5. Matchmaking & Server Issues
At launch, the game often fails to find a match, and when it does, the ping is sky-high. Servers perform poorly, and with so many players in the queue, waiting times can be long. After all that waiting, you often end up in a broken lobby due to connection issues. Toxic players are still a huge problem, and the anti-cheat system isn’t nearly as effective as it should be.

6. Toxicity & Anti-Cheat
The toxicity in CS2 is off the charts. I expected better from the anti-cheat system, but as of now, it still leaves much to be desired. CS2 is falling behind many modern games where anti-cheat measures are far more effective.

7. Final Verdict
CS2 is a disappointment. It’s a game that failed to live up to expectations.The severe optimization issues, outdated graphics, lackluster gameplay changes, and frustrating bugs make it hard to believe this is a finished product.I hope the developers address these problems over time, but for now, this is just CS:GO with slight Source 2 improvements—and that is nowhere near enough to call it a worthy sequel."

so many cheaters
fuck this game
"When the whole focus of the game developer is on earning and selling items in the game, the developer doesn't have time to pay attention to the players, and almost all players use cheats, and no matter how much you report, it won't have an effect."
A lot of Russian kids in this game they are either bots or cheaters
So many cheaters and no one cares about it
"At this moment, Premier may as well be Valve's officially licensed HvH game mode. VAC is a complete utter joke. Until Valve begins to put forth more than bare minimum effort reviews should be negative. We don't need more armory passes or cases, what we need to be able to play Counter Strike without resorting to a 3rd party matchmaking platform."
"no VAC, easy cheater paradise."
Too many cheaters. Bout to reprt some with proof(ScreenRecording my spectations)

terrible.
get into other games cheaters and buggy gameplay
hackers in almost every game. (casual games)
"for starters, I'm not a gamer who is into FPS. my FPS game experience is only games when I was little like CS and PB. that's also my function is only as a complement to the team, if there is someone who is better, I'll be replaced. I have no problem with that.

then about 2 or 3 years ago, my friend invited me to play valorant and quite enjoyed it. from there I thought that it would be good if I could master the fundamentals of FPS games by playing FPS games that are somewhat more difficult than valorant, and my decision fell on CS2.

of course I had a hard time adapting at first, starting from how the UI still felt foreign to some trivial problems such as the scope that was absent on some weapons. but that was still acceptable, because inevitably I finally practiced controlling recoil and aiming more focused.

the big problem arose when my friends and I were able to play competitive mode on the Dust II map. in that game there was one player with the nickname CC, he got the majority of kills in each round. I thought he was good, until something strange happened. the location where my friends and I who were TO'd by CC were far apart and could not be seen from the same angle, even worse he only used dessert eagle. I think he used a cheat or software that at least affected his game, this was even stronger when in one round I threw smoke near outside long then hid in the smoke and also behind the box. out of nowhere I got shot right in the head, and even worse one of my friends who was in shorts got shot right in the head a few seconds before me"
bad game
"Every time I play they VAC me and I don't even know how to cheat in this garbage, yet you get people who has aim bot and other hacks and keep on playing...what a rigged system. Way to go ANTI-CHEAT trash"
Been taking over by hackers.
worst game ive ever played
"Not only is there a ton of people leveling up new so called ""smurf accounts"", making it difficult for actual new players to play against opponenents with similar skills , but there is also a ton of blatantly obvious cheaters, who are sometimes even actively celebrating themselves cheating, without getting banned.
Reporting those people doesnt seem to do anything. By the time some1 might actually get banned, you've most likely encountered a dozen or more others.

So.....Getting into this game is insanely frustrating.....
Don't bother"

"Until HitReg is fixed, this game is absolute dogshit"

"I am low ELO player (highest was 2600 ish.

reached that Friday night, its now Tuesday evening, ive played 16 games and won 3. Im now 1496 ELO, Over 1100 ELO lost in 3 days.

The points per win is all over the place, a 1000 ELO player got 414 points for a win, ive never had that many for a win.

The amount of CHEATERS in the game is at unreal level. Its zero fun because of this. Im close to quitting but will finish my armory passes off first then knock it on the head. VALVE do nothing about the cheaters and it will ultimately kill this once great game.

A crying shame. But its a cheatfest now and cheaters, the rare times they are banned get a 20hr cool down, they dont actually get banned."
Servers are unplayable u rubberband all game even with 300 Mbps upload and download and 20 ping
"worse with every update ,recoil is random and ping is strange and you tell that you remove var but i feel var in every game"
How do you manage to make this game 10x worse than go? and 20x worse than source. This game was garbage on release and remains garbage to this day. The servers don't work and lag. Never had this issue with GO or Source. If your looking to play community servers go back to source.
"Sh1tti3st farcking game that I always come back to. It's either this or dota. Both are wet trash.

Do yourself a favor, if you're even thinking about giving this game a try, consider slapping yourself 12 times, and reconsider your sexual orientation. It's what I'm doing every day at least.

whoever made this game should lowkey jump

delete game from world
ts(this) game full of cigans 💔💔💔
"Things Valve needs to fix:

- Actually implement an Anti-Cheat instead of lying about adding one.
- Either remove or fix the sub-tick system as it is almost completely useless.
- Add better graphics setting tailored to more lower end PCs instead of higher end PCs (No one cares, most people care about frames, not ✨sHiNy wAtEr✨).
- Fix Networking errors (NET JITTER) as it sometimes renders the game unplayable. I need NASA wifi to play the game smoothly.
- Delete CS2 completely as it is terrible compared to CSGO.
- Go back to CSGO!
- and a bunch of other broken stuff that i cant be bothered writing...

Remember kids, only 2 types of people play CS2, Good Players and Masochists!"

"fuck this game, every time i play i get dead pixels for fuck sake"
either you play with hackers or bots
"So I've been playing CS since the goldsource version, you know the one on steam. Very casual player, I liked CS Assault, I like occasionally firing up the game to play with bots because there is very little else out there like this(seriously ask on any forum and people will bend their backs so far as to recommend FACTORIO as a CS like).
This game has ""competitive-game-itus"" it is so focused on chasing esports and whatnot that it's going to starve itself to death. You want bot difficulty in practice matches so you can't literally walk up and knife bots from the front? Screw you, use a console command. You want more than 5v5 in practice matches because this isn't competitive and it's offline with bots? Nah bro edit a text file. Want the full arsenal of weapons because occasionally you enjoy using say the negev or the mac10? Screw you, pick this loadout where the mac10 has to compete with the shotguns and the P90.
It's not much better if you play with people, hey those bots in practice too easy? Well we have aimbots online you can play with!
This game has just continuously stripped features out of itself to the point where the only things it has going for it is that guns feel better to shoot and the graphics are better than it was 20 years ago. Because of the competitive focus I'm pretty sure they're going to remove MORE from the game, just before this game fully dies it's going to be a lootbox simulator that has two other options, change mouse sensitivity and competitive matchmaking."
never ever play this game.
"just got prime 2 days ago on a new account which was still in silver. 9/10 of the games had hackers, im not talking about soft hacking, but straight up spinbotting  + shooting through walls. all games. literally, im not kidding."

S-tier on the worst games oat list.
"For starters if you like being constantly harassed, made fun of by no one else but the russian players, please urgently install this God's forgotten software of a game. If you like to be really angry after every match, cause after harassing you, the russian players seems to be hacking as well, please download this truly kindless game. If you like to be not able to change servers so that You can at least play with players from Yemen or anywhere else NOT russia, please for the love of God, don't wait, please download this amazing art of disfigured thinking. If you like to be absolutely ignored by creators of the game, who give literally zero unbearable concern that half of all the millions of players are hacking and just wants more money, please buy even the Prime for extra cash. Developers will love that.

Why I have more than 1,500 hours on this? Cause this piece of shit is very addictive. Don't. Just don't."
Too much cheaters than cs:go used to have and banning cheaters doesn't work like cs:go used to do.

premier matchmaking is a trash
wo much player using hack
"bad middle east servers that you will always experience packet loss in it plus premiere matches with a heck load of cheaters no matter your elo you will always play with or against at least 1 cheater.
oh, and about that VAC thing they call it anti cheat but all it does is stopping you from changing some settings in your game, so if your a cheater you dont need to be worried about such thing called VAC Anti cheat.
this game is a damn joke at this point"
"the game is full of cheaters. i wouldnt play this game if i were you. 
This game has no anti cheat or at least a good one."
full of cheaters
"The amount of cheaters in the game nowadays is out of control. You essentially can't even play anymore without there being at least 1 person blatantly hacking. This isn't some ""get good"" review either. I've been playing CS in some form or another for over 20 years now and it's just out of control. It really sucks the fun out of the game and makes it very frustrating and disheartening to even try to play a couple matches. May you all have better luck then me."

Dog shit ass game!
Game constatly crashes
just one more case
Should rename it to cheater strike 2 at this point with how many people that are rage cheating in comp and casual lately.
may lose sanity ...
you put all your time into this game just for them to falsely vac your account with all your skins because you booted up the game while running an anti virus that was detected as a cheat....
"17 k oftad ru 8 k tu 3 saat

Why are there so many hackers?
"Instead of making a new engine, maybe focus on getting an actually working anti-cheat."
"vurnete cache i agency, mishki"
Some cheaters do this system with two accounts. You don't need to know any OSINT knowledge to understand it. It's very easy to understand this system because of you can understand that cheaters aren't as smart as those who are making cheats. Also we have a general misconception. Cheaters are not hackers. Losing track your fingerprint on the Internet is as easy as finding it. But these script!diots love to show it off.

Don't let positive reviews fool you. You might think this is a free game but every match cost a piece of your soul that is torn to  pieces little by little by balalaika and sandwich maker players. Do yourself a favor by deleting and never playing again. Do not make same mistake as i do every single time i relaunch it in hopes it will get better.
i dont know mate
no
"The game is nice, but player base full of hackers. Too bad..."
If you want to play against cheaters this is the game for you. Predatory gambling towards underage community is keeping the game alive.

"I've played Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for about 10 years. It was a great game! I really enjoyed it and i would reccomend it to any fan of FPS games. I had a small collection of unique gun skins and enjoyed playing the game with friends or with bots.

And then the update to Counter-Strike 2. How can you call this an update? Sure, the graphics are a bit improved, and that's nice - but not nescessary. Instead, the game has doubled down on cosmetic microtransactions, adding a ton of stuff to buy and trade.

Everything else added has either made the game worse, or was simply removed.
You can't even practice offline with bots anymore because they removed the UI option to change the difficulty.

Is it still fun for people who have been playing for years? yes. Will i play it more? yes, but not as much as i did. And i certainly won't be spending anything on cosmetics - just selling off all my old inventory.

If you're a possible new player - just skip it and play something else. Or keep your eye on this until they make it good again."

The cheating in cs2 is out of control and valve will do nothing about it.

"Good game. Expect if you're Asian its not, You want to play? Chinese bots! Play CS2 in Asia? Chinese bots! 
And the fact that the Chinese bots are spamming in chat makes it even worse because they know they're just staying there standing still and they still want to ruin our fun.

 Fix this please"

VAC = Valve Allow Cheat
Why does this game have the most players on Steam?
One game of Dust ll single handedly is going to make me relapse on nicotine.
"stop moving me to opposite team, stupid dev. make your bot smarter. use AI from dota."

this game has more cheaters than tender
"The anti-cheat system is completely ineffective. In Deathmatch mode, over half the players are just bots grinding for cases. There are countless other problems, but it seems the small indie team would rather focus on creating flashy skins and adding cosmetic charms."
this game made me mentally ill
:D
THE GAME IS NOT OPENING STEAM PLEASE FIX YOUR TRASH GAMEEEEEEEEEEEE
Add anti-cheat game is full of cheaters
The biggest issue with the game is the matchmaking. Far too many games land with heavily skewed teams. Playing with a team of 100-400hrs play time vs a team of 1000+ playtime is absolutely crap. Toss in the rampant number of wall hackers and you're in for a lame gaming experience.
The anticheat is shit the devs dont care about the players anymore.
No

"There is a hacker/cheater in every match. I check every match I play and spectate the enemy team. At least one of them is cheating. Fix your game, Valve.

"It's impossible to play this game on community server. It requires you to use external server browser. The on on Steam is awful so I had to find a website that has better filters. The bigger problem is that alt-tabbing freezes the game, making it impossible to return to it. I have no clue how did Valve mess this up so much. There were no issues like that 2 decades ago."

full of cheaters
"Good game, but cheaters are annoying. The worst thing is that they don't even try to hide that they use cheats. They argue about which cheat is better, right during the game... And when you call others to report a cheater, most players say that I'm a weirdo, because all use cheats and I don't...

I don't know the solution to this issue, but kernel level anti-cheat is defenitely not a good solution."
Absolute cancer of a community that will kick new players for not being good at the game
fuck this game
this game is as addictive as heroin without any of the upsides of heroin.

"bugged out shit game, worst desync in a game ever, worst anti cheat in a game ever if any at all? just a complete waste of time in lobbies infested with cheaters and it keeps connecting you to servers that favor some of the players so it's usually 4-5 stack of 1 ping players while you're on 60+ so glhf and gg in advance, also ridiculous prices and rates on skin drops, it's full of shit skins and impossible to get a decent knife or gloves from cases etc etc so much wrong about this game, cs2 stands for case scam 2 rather than counter strike 2"

terrible game full of cheaters no point of buying prime because cheaters are almost in every game dont recommend.

"The subtick server and the amount of cheater may make this game playable for some time, but after you start every 2 matches to queue up with cheaters and the server not registering the hit it become unplayable. Congratulations valve for ruining this game."

ass game

csgo was better
MANY CHEATERS
a lot of hackers
Bullshit
"I have experienced racial discrimination from players in the game more than once. CS2 has the worst gaming environment and the most chaotic player community I have ever seen. The developers have done absolutely nothing to improve the game environment, even for Premier mode. Cheaters, racists, and players who deliberately sabotage their teammates have always been the majority, severely affecting the experience of normal players. Perhaps this game is just a joke."
"cs2 surf is buggy and bad, please fix and ill like...."
"just, no"
very inconsistent game with aim with very weird recoil with alot of hackers and alot of bugs
"The game is devastating full of cheaters vac not workyng anymore? 
Normal people cnt play 
Repair this game fast!"
Too many cheaters and they doesn't even get banned.
"It's filled with cheaters as of now, every match has one"
"Got the games for several years, there were good times and bad times, now in 2025 with the update for a game that is running shit where you encounter more hackers then anything else, I got banned for installing the new update and trying to start the game 1 month without getting any support or answers, What a piece of shit game that once worked very well known as CS GO."
"This game makes me want to kill myself, after playing this game ive realised that i want to publicly execute myself infront of a loving family of 4, i hate this game from the bottom of my heart, this game makes me want to rip my hair right off of my scalp, id rather be tortured then suffer playing this game. Fuck you."
"Going to continue adding hundreds of hours, but I hate the game so much, but i love it so much. Its like an abusive partner that you just cant leave"
How are we in the lord's year 2025 and we are experiencing BLANTANT CHEATING IN COMPETITIVE MATCHMAKING. GABEN YOU MUST BE JOKING. MY FRIEND SPENDS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON KEYS. HOW CAN YOU NOT AFFORD A DECENT ANTI-CHEAT DETECTION SYSTEM????? YOU ARE LARGE AND YOU ARE A JOKE.

Please for all that is holy avoid this game like the plague."
"DO NOT BUY PRIME!!

I am matchmaking daily with hackers

I mostly play community servers nowadays, because their admins are banning hackers in least then 5 minutes


VAC do better!"
no lake = shit game
This game is in a sad state with cheaters.
"full of cheaters, not worth buying prime in 2025"
CS:GO was better.
"before playing this game i had ambitions, money, a social life, and was fairly open minded. I now have a gambling addiction, debt, lost several friends, and have a deep hatred for Russians and black people. If you have something to lose do not play this game, the only constant in cs is ""if you have something, this game will take it"""

This games matchmaking makes me want to individually rip out every single one of my ball hairs

But even tho i have said this game is bad i will still continue to play, because i love suffering"
my teammates have a brain tumor
"The game is a shadow of its former self. On 8/10 games there will be at least on hacker either on your team or the enemies. It is a pity, because it used to be such a fun game. Nowdays, it just doesnt worth your time!"
cheater game
TOO MUCH CHEATERS CUZ VALVE ONLY CARES IF U BUY SKINS. PLUS CS2 IS JUST RESKING OF CSGO THAT LAGS LIKE CRAZY

"the worst matchmaking ever, only faceit makes this game playable"
"Counter-Strike 2 was supposed to be an upgrade, but instead, it feels like a downgrade in many ways. While the graphics and lighting improvements look nice, they don’t make up for the numerous issues that plague the game.

What Went Wrong?

Terrible Hit Registration – Shots often feel inconsistent, making competitive play frustrating.
Limited Content – Many features from CS:GO are missing, including beloved game modes and maps.
Subpar Movement & Mechanics – The game feels sluggish, and the new mechanics don’t improve the gameplay.
Matchmaking is a Mess – Ranks are broken, and cheaters are rampant.
Optimization Issues – Performance is worse than CS:GO, with stutters and FPS drops even on high-end PCs.
Final Verdict:
CS2 had potential, but right now, it feels like an incomplete game with frustrating mechanics. Instead of being an improvement over CS:GO, it took several steps back. If Valve doesn’t fix these issues soon, many players will move on.

4/10 – A downgrade, not an upgrade."
bad
"It's just a simple game for simple minds, but I still play it anyway."
Keeps fucking kicking me mid game for corrupt game fucking files holy shit can you let me play the fucking game and kick the fucking cheater holy fuck like at least do the file verification fast it always take 3 fucking hours not even kidding so i get a ban and the ban also expires in the time period of me not being able to play the fucking game
poo

They let cheaters take over this game.
They dont tell me that they like borsh or pelmenis
its an alright game but so far i cant figure how to choose my weapon in casual however deathmatch is awfull dont play is not even about skill how can u kill person that spawned infront of you or u spawning behind them is something that takes no skill its cheap kill but its valve fault almost  feels like playing uncoded game cuz people spawing all over place ive probably spawn in front of enemy not facing towards them just get killed instantly u need fix spawn location or just spawns in general because it a big problem in deathmatch

"Can't play this shit without running at least 80 fps maximum but run with 30 - 60 fps. The graphics are very forced even on the lowest settings. Judging by my gaming laptop and setting my preformance settings and fans at MAXIMUM. CS2 just acts like they're all good and shit with their ""fancy graphics"" So you're telling me I have to blow 2,200 dollars on a monitor? Wtf is this shit. Can't even play the game without one cheater or microphone spammer in each match. And yet Valve once told me to open my eyes at 1999, then open my mind at the 2000's, then telling me to open my wallet in 2025. And now Valve's slob ass wants me to devote my life savings to open a case just to get a 0.03 cent weapon skin. And don't even start with the knives. STOP CHARGING 1000 DOLLARS FOR A FUCKING BUTTERFLY KNIFE. You don't get anything good UNLESS you open your wallet. Fuck you Valve, thanks for everything."

"Game is full of cheaters and you are not allowed to surrender a match unless someone abandons the game so you have to sit there and twiddle your thumbs for 20 minutes or abandon the match and get a cooldown.

"first off all forcing me to play training against bots almost made me uninstall instantly. Anyway, the slightly improved graphics dont make up for 90% of community servers are ""skin"" servers where people stand around looking at their ""skins"".  News Flash: all of your ""skins"" look gross. I know your monkey brain thinks bright color fancy pattern will attract mates but... No, sorry.

The only server I could find with people playing it was a deathmatch server with 4 other players I dominated easily but they had botlike names so they were probably bots with simulated portrait/ping."

"Game is ruined by cheaters, especially premier matchmaking. I got cheaters in enemy and in my team 10/12 games."
"sure the graphics are amazing, the physics almost real, but valve needs to be called out for grabbing our cash and still making cs a paradise for cheaters and farming bots, u need to pay attention to your casual lobby because thats where most of ur future lies, in those players who will aspire to go prime or pro, the fact that they are exploiting our emotional connect to this beautiful game makes it worse, how can these guys sleep at night without feeling accountable for this mess is baffling. it has  been two years and still they dont care enough to fiix these annoying glitches but when it comes to grabbing cash they will extend their hands  like a frog whipping out its tongue to catch a fly.  irresponsible pricks.

after i got prime, my casual gaming experience has gone to hell since m constantly thrown into these farming bots lobby every time i try to play dust, i meant why did u ask for my cell number and mails if ur verification process was such a sham, fix this mess before every one else deserts you for some other cash grab game, since theres no difference between them and ur ethics anymore,"
"Maby try to put a price on this game, 10-15 euros for example, and ban cheaters for life"

Russians and turks are biggest flaw of this game
"lol, no"
if they finally ban rage cheaters its good again
So many cheaters...
boner
not very fun
The amount of cheaters really make this game unbearable.
"horrible game do not install, do not get into it. first they reel you in with the cool looking skins and gameplay.  You have some fun and go on a crazy losing streak.  Next thing you know. you are getting decimated with cheaters and retards.  You get stuck at low elo and you can't escape the hell because you get put with people that react in 4-7 business day, people that dont have any sense of sound, direction or communication, or just get paired with a whole team of people who can't together manage to kill a single person on the enemy team.  At first you laugh it off and know you are new.  After that, you just get pretty angry.  Eventually after a few hundred hours you reach the breaking point, and you enter disbelief that it is possible to play a video game so poorly, and you are fucking done and you just leave matches, quit, or otherwise throw in the towel.  Your blood pressure rises and its just different levels of fury and disappointment.  But the bad part is that not long after, you get that itch again.  Either from yourself of from your party bros, you decide to hop on again, thinking about a nice juicy win streak, some nice nades, some heavenly headshots and frags.  In reality, you lose 4 matches in a row, you question your chices and sanity, and you want to end it all.  You type quit smoking in the console, and then you get called a retard meanwhile you are trapped in low elo, csgo shit hell.  Basically, this cycle of doing bad, getting angry, then just being dissapointed, and then itching to play again continues till all you can play is cs2.  Anyway even if you somehow escape the wrath, they bring you back with the itch to have to hoard and buy all of the virtual pixels and skins on the screen.  I fucking hate this game, i wish i had never played it a few years ago, and I will never ever get my time on this game back.  I am tired of retards, cheaters, and people who you could convince me are bots because they play worse than the local nursing home. 


Edit* in addition they hit you with the ""99 in 2"" shit or the teammates that sit in nonexistant angles or corners behind angles waiting to get corner peaked and mowed down, or just wait to get flanked and shredded by a fucking pp bizon or some bs.  This stuff and retards that deide to peak heavily guarded sightlines that have awps and other shit like shotguns or negevs and get shredded really put the cherry on top.

For goodness sake please valve delete this video game, thank you gaben."
Never open cases in this game. Go to a gambling site(you have better odds)
Every other update i get lag problems of crashes every time i enter a map. I have to wait for the next update to MAYBE have it fixed. I get the feeling half the time the developers have no clue what they are doing. This is not an acceptable state for an online competitive game.
easy to cheat when you can be in discord and tell your friends where everyone is on map. would be nice if you couldnt spectate enemies. It is fun when you find a non cheating lobby
since moving over to amd i get so many random crashes. went from a gtx970 to an rx6600 overall fps is high but crashes like once every 2 or 3 matches
i love CS2 it is the best game ever made i like how they make all the dogshit changes on all maps except dust 2 bc they didnt touch it all almost. I love how my shots are not registered and how game is laggy. I just love it. It is good thing you killed cs go. Why would game be good and perfect when you can make it shittier. I love cs2. best game ever. Only thing that is still good about this game is you an be racist and say and type everything you want everything else is dogshit.

GANDU GAME
"Anticheat is awful, and there are hackers in EVERY single game."
Sh*t ass game run around gambling and whose developers focus on sucking G4bes d*ck instead of the ever rotting cheater and fraud problem. Tier 2 cs is a JOKE
gave me depression
no
keeps crashing mid game
CSGO is Better
"this game would be 50x better if it stayed on cs:go.
back when cs:go was the main game, there were *less* hackers, more maps better hud better movement
thats just to name a few.
valve, you've fucked over a great game. a GREAT game.
counter strike in general is a great concept and its sad to see it being ruined by;
valve, thousands of cheaters, bad updates and more
cs2 was a flop. it will be a flop until the end of its life and when it dies, it wont come back
its in its last life. this game is honestly great
but that doesnt change the fact that its been fucked over by valve
bringing back cs:go and lowering the price of ""prime"" would be better to this game as a whole
noone has to spend 15$ to actually start playing cs
make it like 10 maybe? 
also bring back the atmosfere cs:go had
that dark hellish theme on nuke, on dust 
bring back OLD maps hell bring back CS:GO
cs:go was the reason why this game EXPLODED in popularity
..and its the reason why its dying now
since so many people miss cs:go they decide to quit. can't you see valve?
do something. 
bring. back. cs:go.
or maybe along side cs2 
make cs:go also active, like how source is still availble to play?
make cs:go available to play too."

BAD BAD GAME
"Two years since release and game still is still a substantially subpar experience when compared to CSGO. Movement and shooting remain awkward and unresponsive, bunny-hopping is inconsistent to the point of impossible, the physics are questionable (why do I still rubber-band when I collide with a teammate?), and no maps have been added to the competitive pool that we haven't seen before.

With regards to matchmaking, it is an unplayable experience with coin flip cheater games at 25k ELO and above, and no VAC/VACNET improvements in sight.

And the most crucial element to the CS zeitgeist, community servers, has been taken out to the proverbial woodshed by having an in-game community server browser that is objectively WORSE than what CSGO had. Furthermore, the lack of an official API has degraded the quality of custom maps and servers such as KZ and surf, gamemodes that started 20 years ago with CS 1.6 and were present in every previous game, are now dead. 

With all that said, it becomes very clear that no one at Valve cares, let alone understands what made Counter Strike great. And worst of all, you cannot even go back to CSGO and play on community PUGs there."

Sort out your AntiCheat the game is unplayable..
"Valve's matchmaking is dogshit, a waste of time. You either tryhard and get fucked or don't care and get fucked. Either way a sad sight to behold, lost vision Fortnite ahh piece of shovelware. Wasted potential at best, predatory gambling for children at worst."
"Dog water, full of cheaters, fix your game valve"
Every match has a obvious or a secret cheater. Lucky if you only get one of them and in your team.
"10 games of premier, in these games i saw 40-50 hackers."

"This was a very anticipated update to CSGO, but since it released it's been a total mess. Even after so many - almost daily - updates, it is still very broken and a mess. The guns are messed up and the AK47 is ridiculously unbalanced compared to any other gun in the game. Also the cheater problem has spiraled out of control, it is worse than it has ever been and Valve doesn't seem to give a shit about it. I love CS but this game is unplayable and unenjoyable. I miss the good old CSGO."

"MOST OF THE PART I DISLIKE TO MUCH BOT FARMING . HACKER AND LIST GO ON,"

It is the most worst game in match making even I have prime status a lot of cheaters and afkers even when we are winning and opposite team is cheating it will cancel the match just wasting my time in losing because of reasons out of my responsibility.
Should've stayed CS:GO for a while.

"Absolute dog shit !!!! people getting ban for griefing when they actually not , Cheaters with autoaim full rage every single game . VAC is dogshit not working . and they actually ask for money for prime skins and other bulshit . HOW DARE YOU !!!"
"Too much racism, ableism, sexism, and general toxicity in the voice and text chats of the game. In addition valve (and other devs) can't seem to reasonably manage the cheating situation in a way that allows the games to feel fair. 

To further clarify when i say fair, I mean games where the reason for defeat can be viewed from the lens of ""how well did your team play as a team"" and not extenuating factors like someone on the other was exploiting the game in some way."
my life has gotten worse since ive started playing but i bought prime its too late for me now

"You know, i played 1.6 condition zero, css for like over 50000 hours playing some sort of count strike. when im telling you since early 2000's the one and worse part of this game is cheaters. Wallhackers to be more precise, like 50% of the game walls. For 20+ years they cant fix the problem. To get walls and install them is so easy that a child can do it. VAC is absolutely do nothing, Developers dont care, like before as a child i didnt pay attention and at some point wallhacked myself in CSS, because its just how everyone was. Developers DO NOT give a shyte, 20+ years cant fix this issue. To wall its simple as replacing a folder. Pathetic from valve."

do NOT play this game
valve fucked up every aspect of the game
"This game is absolutely abysmal. I wish I could give it less than one star because it truly deserves nothing to it's name. It's full of racist, Zionist, homophobic people. I'd rather shove a jar of rats up my ass and unscrew the lid than play this awful game. I hope that the developers of this game take a long hard look at their life and realise what they've done. I have no words to describe my hatred and disappointment in this game. I saw one of my friends, Ashton, playing this (awful) game. He was playing a mode that I thought looked quite fun. Surf it was called, I eventually load on and discover that it is the root of all cancer and depression. Whoever plays this TERRIBLE game is a half-whit gloom moron with the mental age of a -11 year old and that isn't even fucking possible. 

I am ending this sad, melancholy and depressive review with a note to all thinking of, about to, and or installing CS2. Delete it and bleach your eyes, mouth and ears so you completely forget this horrific game exists."

Hope humanity will one day invent cure from disease that every cheater have
"I have spent thousands of hours on this game. Like most people I have played not only CS:GO, but also 1.5, 1.6, etc. Worst thing is, there are people who have spent 10 times the amount of hours I have, and have the same experience. I have seen better management of people banning hackers (being very careful about being caught) from people doing it FOR FREE in community servers back in the day. How is a company of this size and magnitude not able to do anything about this?

I have NEVER left a review before in my life, positive or negative. This is the first time. In both Premier and Competitive I have now, for last few days seen hackers IN ALL GAMES. That's FIVE games a day. Somebody hacking BLATANTLY in every game. I'm not talking about wallhacks, triggerbots and other things that are hard to catch. I'm talking people using Scouts, Deagles and whatever having 20 kills, all headshots, I didn't peek and I'm dead type of situation. 

The sad thing is, they've always been hackers for the past few years. My friends and I were okay playing against people wallhacking at least once in a few games, even aimhacking. How sad is that? That you're okay with having your game ruined 20-30% of the time? 

They've ruined this beyond recognition. Don't ever download this game, and if you have it, delete it and don't look back. I don't know who is to blame, is it all the devs, is it the idiot at the top making the decision and setting priorities, but pushing empty updates instead of addressing a glaring issue like HACKING is not what this community deserves.

We deserve better than this. Move away to other games that appreciate your time and money spent on them, move onto something that is not.. this. Peace."

why
"Having loved Doom 3, Gave this one a try.
The game's main premises is simple - Run & Gun with no proper compelling storyline.
Gets redundant very quickly."
"I don't like doing this, but I have to say coming back to this game isn't fun for me...

Bear in mind, ""not recommend"" doesn't mean that I hate this game or those who enjoy it. I might even try it again in the future, because I think it does quite a few thing very well.

The thing is...this game isn't what it is advertised as or what people remember it as. What do I mean? Think of Doom 2016 and all that plays in every mind palace, mine included, is sweet music going ""dudda-dudda doodleoodleoodle dudda-dudda-dudda"" as beefy guns go ""chunk-chunk-chunk"" and ""pa-kow pa-koom!"" while demons get ripped apart...YEAH!!!

But that isn't nearly the whole game. Gracious me...the platforming and you know I'm right. Have mercy...the hard stop cutscenes, where my guy who rips demons in half stops EVERYTHING to watch a woman hobble her way to an elevator. Bruh, if I have to see a delivery drone fly off again...how about I get upgrades by ripping them from a demon?

Then, the combat isn't nearly as good as we remember. What was fun and fast and frenetic during the dark days of the corona-times, when I first played the game, is just dull, lifeless circle-strafe this and hitscan, hitscan, oop! I hit a rock and now got sucker punched by a demon and now I'm dead...yawn, wake me up when the game loads back up, thanks.

I respect what the game did, absolutely, but heaven above I'm tired of circle-strafing brown/black/red enemies in brown/black/red environment. I don't care about this story. I don't care about these characters. I don't care about these enemies or the environments...every time I come back to Doom 2016 I just get bored.

It did what it did when it did it. Again, I respect that we finally got a game that didn't have to have armed mercenaries show up so we could have gratuitous Call of Duty combat with chest high walls...yeah I'm looking at you, AvP! But coming back to this, I just don't like it. 

It's been the better part of a decade and it is okay to acknowledge that something isn't a great as I remember. Again, if you like the game, don't let my words take that from you, but it is equally okay to acknowledge that the game is by no means some flawless work of the divine just because it has some good character animations.

I value Doom 2016's presence in gaming's history, even as I can't recommend it."
strong mid
my eyes got damaged and too much red stuff
"I think it's hilarious that the monsters are basically piñatas. You get bonus goodies for slicing them open with a chainsaw. 
The text lore is entertaining, and the UAC seems like satire of real world corporations. 
The arcade mode is a nice feature, along with the exploration fetish, easter eggs, and other tributes to original DOOM. 
I don't have to mention how exquisite the soundtrack is. 
I've only unlocked three of the classic DOOM maps, and two of them were basically empty rooms with some items. I groped around for hidden panels and found nothing. Testing the maps from the menu selection proved that this was some kind of glitch.

The capacity for optimization is impressive, but that should be expected from a game that was marketed on gaming console systems. I would probably get much better performance if I ran the game off of an SSD in a dedicated operating system.
Ultimately, I cannot recommend this game because of the curse of DRM, and also because of the satanic iconography and demon glyphs. The visual context of a hell wrought game world is one thing, but the prominence of satanic icons in interface graphics is just cursed. 
It would be funny if one could activate a piñata graphical mod like in Gunman Taco Truck. ""Festive"" mode. Maybe someday this ""intellectual property"" can change hands so that I can enjoy it without steam, and maybe I can mod out some of the annoying interface graphics. I did replace the hell loading screen.
Let go, bethesda, you whore. Let this game go to GoG and other DRM-free platforms. Give us access to earlier versions, betas, and any console or region exclusive content.
All Glory to Jesus Christ."
"Doom 2016 doesnt work.  I did when it was new.  Now its goes black screen everytime .  
Same with WWE 2k15"
"Frankly, not that fun on m&k. The sound design is lacking, leaving guns feeling like they have no real feedback. The UI is horrendous to navigate, and the finishers just feel like glorified cutscenes breaking the pace of fights. It feels like everything about it was designed around consoles, and the game greatly suffers for it."
"Brilliant action surrounded in tedious level design and a so-so story some of those levels I had to complete in multiple sessions because they were so tiring/boring, also one of my achievements never unlocked for getting all of the runes in the campaign so why bother for the last collectable if the same might happen again, maybe only buy on sale but i won't be recommending this over-hyped game of the decade to anyone,"
i dont know what to put in this review. its just not fun
"I really wanted to enjoy this. I cannot, really boring game-play,  bad story, horrible gore."
"Crashes EVERY time I get to gold level on arcade foundry.  

EDIT nag screen from Steam.... would I like to revise my revew....  YES... Its doing it on other levels too but not just when you reach Gold."
save file keeps corrupting and screwing me over. i was almost finished with the campaign when the file corrupted. happened twice since installing it a month ago. save your money and frustration
"Some time ago, I really don't remember when, I bought DOOM, but I don't think that I played it.  Then, I was interested in maybe purchasing DOOM Eternal, so I decided I would check out the DOOM franchise by playing the one I got.  Man, I was lucky that I did that because by the time I got totally fed up with the BS map (designed by a 3rd grader no doubt - super scientific and all of that) I cam to realize what the ""Eternal"" part of the title meant.  So, after running around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around I reached that solemn point of ""Maximum Boredom"" and decided there just had to be better things to do with my life than this junk.  Now, for the nerds and introverts out there who really have nothing going on in their lives this is probably great fun.  Why they can brag to their friends that they spent another wasted evening wading thru garbage.  I guess that the idea of paying money for a ""challenge"" is kind of a stupid thing to do from the get-go, especially when the challenge quickly melds into total boredom.  So, thanks to this DOOM I have realized that investing in any further stupidity would be a double waste, i.e. time AND money.  My suggestion for something a bit more entertaining would be to teach yourself to read ancient Sanskrit."
"this game is the worst game i have ever played, truely horrible."
One of the greatest games of all time. Would have liked to play it again in 2025 but it won't start.
"No thanks. The Quake games had more satisfying weapons.
- They nerfed the shotgun! How can a game be called ""Doom"" and trash the shotgun?! It's weak and has barely any range.
- Plastic looking, bullet sponge enemies.
- Unskippable blah blah blah blah blah blah blah who cares cut-scenes.
- An anorexic old lady named Olivia is the main villain at first. What a threat!
- They really lean into the Doom guy being infused with demonic powers instead of just a regular doomed space marine.

It is way more satisfying to play Brutal Doom (a free mod) on the original WAD files, or with some of the custom maps and episodes."
this is just quake 4
"Repetitive, and boring."
"This game while amazing saves all of your progress on one ""campaing save"" - it crashed on me, and the save got corrupted, losing me 13h progress with no hope of recovery, no backups or anything. 
Honestly i can't understand why they've introduced such asinine way to track player's progress :("
"(For those planning to play DOOM 2016 on “I’m Too Young to Die” difficulty)
I know—I gave a thumbs down and I genuinely didn’t want to. This is easily one of the best games of all time. It has everything: flawless graphics, a gripping storyline, and fights that are both challenging and creative.
So why the thumbs down?
(Spoiler alert)
Near the end, the game throws a couple of demons at you that push the difficulty to an unreasonable level. Honestly, it took all the fun out of it. My thumbs are blistered as I write this, and my controller is threatening to call the cops for abuse.
I couldn’t finish the game—and this is my petty revenge."
SINGLE PLAYER GAME THAT ASKS YOU TO CREATE A BETHESDA ACCOUNT? FUCK YOU TODD HOWARD
"Sadly the game crashed in the second to last level and my save got corrupted. Up until then it was fun, but this is a gamebreaking (literally) bug."
"This game is ass in terms of gameplay who says its ""fast paced"" never played a real fast paced game, It's slow and if u tryna play on higher difficulty it's ass, you can't even more around freely, the movement fucking sucks, I reinstalled it a few days ago and said ""I got doom eternal and played it instantly but I have just a few hours of DOOM 2016""I replayed it and it's ass, I keep seeing articles of people saying this game is better than Eternal and it's just not true, they are fucking braindead to think that. DOOM 90s Is more  fast paced than this. The game is just unskippable cutscenes and it's just not really rip and tear like people say. Overall, just buy the 90s games or Eternal I had much more fun playing on Nightmare rather than playing 2016."
"Thought I would go back and give Doom and Doom Eternal a run before the new launch. Great game, even today still a blast. That is until the platforming garbage. I forgot why I haven't enjoyed a Doom game since the original. Completely breaks the game flow. And it's only worse in Doom Eternal."
boring gameplay in my opinion. more parkour and unskippable cutscenes than ripping and tearing
"[b]IF YOU ARE HAVING STUTTER PERFORMANCE ISSUES: DISABLE STEAM OVERLAY FOR THIS GAME[/b]

Game runs really poorly for no reason, spent close to an hour trying to find a fix. Needs to be fixed by the developers ASAP. I believe this issue came after the somewhat recent Steam overlay redesign."

"The environments are beautiful and the weapons feel nice when shooting, but it gets boring doing the same thing after getting all the weapons, you won't fall asleep but it gets stale."
Game so boring that I regret spending 3 dollars.
fast and fun but a bit repetitive. played it on easy b/c I suck.
"Kind of overrated? It's fun for a bit, and the gameplay is very smooth and feels very well optimised. I had no stutters or hick ups at any point in my time playing it. However, I didn't find it very engaging either. For me the ""glory kills"" mechanic sort of ruins the game. 

You'll be running and jumping around trying to dodge some enemies while your shooting down the other ones, then you press F and for a moment your character is locked in place, you can't move or look around, your crosshair disappears and you get an over the top kill animation. This doesn't stop the time in game though, the other enemies are still running around you. Once the animation is over I always felt a bit confused as to where I was and where the other had enemies gotten to while that was happening. Annoyingly, if you don't go for glory kills, you end up having to pump a lot more bullets into the enemy to kill them, which then leads to ammo issues..."

"Great game, everything about it is amazing except one MASSIVE flaw, going back through old completed missions and getting collectibles, to get yourself caught up on achievements. then continuing from where you left off, restarting the mission will completely reset all completion progress made and it will save from where you started when you decided to back track on the older completed missions."
8 hours into the game it just stopped working one day. Whatever update happened in Jan 2025 makes the game unable to launch.
"I don't like the game play, mechanics and repetitiveness of the game."

"multiple glitches during fights and having to restart missions, its a good game but ruined by the amount of glitches."
"I thought I'd reacquaint myself with this game before Dark Ages arrives. After getting the platinum on PS4 back in 2016, I was looking forward to the PC 'experience'.
Unfortunately, with a controller, this game is unplayable - strafing left with the joystick just does not work. 
After some research into this, the problem (or similar) seems common, but no solution works for me.

Gutted.

Not all of us have the dexterity to use a keyboard and mouse, so with no prior knowledge of the controller issue before purchasing, I cannot recommend this game to others if you too are planning to use a controller."
Runs abhorrently poorly. People share the same sentiment in forums with the issues that I have and in Eternal but there is no solution.
Game breaking progression bugs that have gone unaddressed for 9 years.

Super Shotgun is the turning point for the next 2/3rd of the game's difficulty turning into a joke. Exploration is boring and not noteworthy. Combat is easy, gives you too much ammo, glory kills are good but don't present an interesting mid combat decision since there doesn't feel like a lot of risk. Progression system sucks, there are too many progression systems, less is more. Story doesn't matter, but I liked Darin De Paul's performance as Samuel Hayden. I hope I like Doom Eternal because this underwhelmed me."
"Boring,Too slow, S L O W

Too slow
"From Boomer shooter to ZOOMER shooter.

No."
"I've used to playing this game, when I was left to going work, hadn't playing this for a few years. I decided to uninstalled it for later when I have time. So in January 2025, I decided to downloading it because I was so freaking excited about Doom's newest game.

So after that awhile; I was starting to opening the game and it's have a black screen, I really tried to fixing the resolutions. Fixing the ""Config files."", also downloading the GPU's drivers lately. Since I was updating everything on it. Suddenly it's still offically have a black screens for me and I unable to playing this game. 

I absolutely loved this game, I was super sad that's I can't playing this game anymore since I came back to downloading it again."

"Feels so wrong to play this after Eternal, it really is just a complete downgrade in every level, way too easy too, spamming op weapons is pretty much meta. If you already played Eternal don't even bother, nothing is better here"
RESTARTING MISSION DELETES YOUR REVISITED PROGRESS WITHOUT WARNING. LOST SO MANY HOURS WORTH OF GAME PLAY BECAUSE OF THIS! SO I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AS THAT IS A SERIOUS NEGATIVE!
This game sucks lettuce balls. Buy it if you enjoy getting launched into the sky every 5 minutes.
"Very overrated, doesn't respect your time with no manual saves, and it's a step back from The New Order."
Good revival!  Too bad about DRM on Doom Drak Ages.
I don't know what causes it and after some research this game doesn't like to run on modern hardware as far as the CPU goes. i have an R9 7950x. if there is a fix please let me know. the game lags and bounces the FPS up and down.

"Its levels stretch long. The combat is easy, and at the time of writing this, im at one of the last levels. I've died 10 times thru the 6.3 Hours I've spent on this.  The original was similar however, it was a new thing at the time. If you have a huge monitor, it will be very annoying to play, majority of it is squished."
My save file got corrupted at the very last level.
"WOW.  This is NOT an action game. It's a staring at the map game.

Third level in and I'm FED UP with his game. I'M DONE!  It's an overly complicated maze of a map that is difficult to navigate even in map mode, and I've spent more time studying the map just to figure out where to go that actually playing the game. For an ""action"" game, there is WAY too much downtime just staring at a map and figuring out what to do. After 20 minutes of trying to study and navigate an overly complicated map, i have given up because i am just lost. There is no clear indication on how to progress to the next area even after downloading the full map. There is NO clear indication on how one area connects to another. This is NOT an action game, its 80% staring at the map trying to figure it out.

On top of that, they give you challenges to complete. There have been NO opportunities in this level to complete 2 out of 3 of them that i have seen. you are supposed to kill 6 enemies of a certain type, in different ways, but they WILL not spawn thru most of the level, and when they do, like once, the mission objectives do not give you the required environmental objects to complete it. maybe it exists in a one time certain scenario, but if you mess it up, you do not get a second chance.

OK. lets replay the mission and try to get the super rare objectives done that was impossible to get the first time. Got it. Oh no look at that, it wont save your accomplishments!  as soon as you save and exit the game, they are gone like you never did them!  you get no credit for your goals after exiting the game. COOL!  as soon as you finish a level but didnt accomplish a goal that was near impossible to do, you have to restart the ENTIRE game from scratch just to get it to register, because replaying missions has absolutely no point of effect.

I've NEVER played a FPS thats so overly complicated and broken as this stupid stupid game."
"The game in principle more less, but the plot is weak, the variety is almost no, so that the game for 1 time."
画面太恶心，经常迷路
Game play is repetitive. Boring Story. Did not like it.
mid?
shitty ass fucking game
Not Recommended
"its like eternal, but bad, but we didn't know it was bad until eternal came out"
"I can't recommend due to the following reasons:
- ""Rip and tear"" they say -well, can't do that without ammo. Yep, you run out of ammo fast.
- No focus on story: Challenges and arena fights are major.
- Boss fights are totally bland: Repetitive attacks pattern and all the time another phase. One of the bosses start circling like a prima ballerina -literally.
- ""Easy"" should be relaxing, why is it the same as normal?
- Bad map design: Most of the time you get locked in an area with demons and you can only get out when you killed them all. This repeats many, many times. Really boring.
- Inconsistency in mouse speed. Sometimes it is normal, the next moment it is slower -and there is a mouse lag while in menus -IN MENUS!
- The sound quality changes many times. Example: Half a map the sound quality is like an old TV, next time it sounds like in a cave, the next map the bass got boosted.
- Heavy focus on challenges and achievements: Without them you can't upgrade your weapon and skills.
- Finish moves (Glory kills): At the beginning they're awesome but they happen so many times that it bored me out after 3 hours -and the demons recovers their hit points if you don't use the chance, so you need more ammo to kill them ...what makes the glory kills annoying and less glorious.
- A weapon does not make the same damage. Sometimes I need 2 shots for an Imp, sometimes 4, when they stand in front of me though. Same with all the other weapons."
KEEP YOUR MONEY SPEND IT IN THE REAL WORLD.
"Having played every Doom game in existence, then all the Quake multiplayer madness, I really should have liked this game. Sadly, I don’t like it and I struggled to put my finger on why. I was barely into the game, and I felt fatigued as if I were wasting my time. Then I finally figured it out. It was the pacing and the glory kill system that were the problem and there is no way to fix it. 

	I am no stranger to first-person shooters, and they all have a familiar mechanic that I really love. You shoot everything that moves until it stops moving then you look for something else to shoot. In Doom, they opted for a new mechanic where you shoot everything that moves until it moves differently, and then you glory kill it. 

	In case you’re not familiar with the term, a glory kill is where you perform a finishing maneuver on an already defeated enemy. In Doom’s case, these are short, well-animated gore fests that can be really shocking the first few times you see them. You basically shoot up an enemy until they enter a helpless state, swaying back and forth as if drunk. Then you run up to them and finish them off with a quick animated take-down. This rewards the player with a small amount of health and armor which seems to be part of the core mechanic. You need that health and armor because doom is stingy with placement of it on the map, and it can run short fast. 

	However, after your two hundredth glory kill, you have seen all the animations and they are rapidly getting boring. I got bored with it in less than an hour of play as I asked myself the eternal question. Why did they give me all these guns if I have to kill everything with my bare hands?

	It seems like they should have just given me a sword or a big hammer or something because you have to kill nearly all the monsters up close and personal, and this just gets old fast. You see, the original Doom games all had one thing in common: long-range. You did your best to engage everything from as far away as possible and focused on targets that were close to restore your range. This game is very different and encourages you to fight at very close ranges so you can get those glory kills. 

	But Omni I hear you say, you don’t have to use them. Well, that’s where you are wrong. Unfortunately, this mechanic is baked into the game's DNA and you can’t turn it off. Ammo and armor aren’t plentiful on the maps, and if you insist on shooting things to death, you will quickly discover you're low on everything. You see ammo and armor drops from every monster you perform a glory kill on, and you need those drops to survive. Using the chainsaw to finish an enemy off turns them into a loot pinata and showers you with goodies. 

	Now I love a good loot shower, but I wanted more doom where I ran about guns blazing and left a trail of dead enemies in my wake. I want to be able to kill them with my guns, and only my guns like god intended it to be. None of this, sissy; run up and kick the weakened enemy so I can get some of my bullets back. Not to mention that the kills themselves kept drawing me out of the pacing. Having to stop every three to five seconds to make another glory kill just ruins the fast-paced gunplay I was craving. 

	Now, are the graphics good? You bet they are. Some of the best I have ever seen with enemies and the aforementioned glory kills animated to perfection. The music and sounds are a solid addition, really helping to set the player's blood pumping. Level design is creative, with plenty to explore and look at. I really felt like I was on Mars in some kind of laboratory complex while hell invaded. 

	But all of those good points can’t overcome the fact that this game didn’t play like the doom I remember. I don’t care for this game, and I am very sad to say I won’t play more of it."
Who came up with this terrible idea of ​​putting melee attacks to recover health in a shooting game? It completely interrupts the flow of combat.
cant sex the revenant
Very disappointed that I can't kiss the demons as an alternative to violence.
"Great music, thanks to Mick Gordon. 

Rest sucks."
This is good in the beginning and then it just going more and more boring because of the one style game no jump scares
Glory killing a Soldier crashed my game.
wont launch
its not intering multi player mode
"super buggy, fall through floor and have to complete the same event 3 times for an achievement buggy. story is infuriating and boring somehow simultaneously. be prepared to have your shots disappear, enemies aimbot, melees bug out, no ability to sprint, dodge, slide, push etc. oh yeah, and beating the game on nightmare confers the same reward as beating it on very easy. honestly, secret hunting was more fun than actually playing the missions. I somehow upgraded every rune, yet didn't unlock the every run achievement. appearently this is a going on 9 year old bug. the only redeeming quality of this game is the amazing environment, character, surface modelers, the animators, lighting, fx, and cinematic artists. doubt they got paid what they were worth."
I don't own this game. I don't recommend this game to other players. You'll only see this 52 times because that's how many times I jumped back on the hamster wheel.
"If this was free I would turn that thumbs down into a thumbs up, maybe. I'm sorry to all the Doom fans out there, but your game is not good in the eyes of me. That matters."
"It's a fantastic game. To bad the corpos plastered it with dlc, an AGGRESSIVE eula and 97% of the main menu is adds.

Mr Gordon did a great job. The morons in suits ruin everything.

How can I get a high paying job ruining things with MY stupidity?"
No
AAAAAGGGGHHHHHH TOO SCARY!!!!!!!!
one of the rare games that give me motion sickness.
"I'm more a fan of doom 3 and the original games.

The ""gore"" genre ain't doing it for me at all and the story is basically non-existent.

You really are invincible in this game, man... it feels so ""plastic"" to just run around knowing that whatever hellish being you're going to fight you're just gonna kick ass every single time. it feels kinda ironic to play a somewhat soulless game (in terms of story, repetitive combat, etc.) while the graphics makes you want to stay around for longer.

also, it would be fine to have 12+ weapons if they would have some significance in terms of damage or usage, instead you completely rely on the quantity of ammunition so there's not really a point in having that big variety of guns whatsoever.

Maybe i was gullible thinking this was gonna build on the doom 3 story and maybe have the same mechanic foundation, but i was terribly wrong and just as disappointed.
although, as i stated,  I can't talk bad regarding the graphics... the game is absolutely beautiful and really captivates the hell-ish-horror ""everything's f*cked"" type of feel.

4/10"
"I finished it (only 33% of players have the final achievement, which says something), but it wasn't very engaging. Skip this and go straight to Doom Eternal, a truly fantastic game."
"This game is 10% fun, fast paced combat, and 90% slowly combing each level for upgrades and secrets - which is honestly boring and annoying.
So... the game is 10% good."
"I honestly don't get the hype, maybe it's just not for me but DOOM just felt like an ordinary shooter, the weapons feel floaty and yeah the soundtrack is good but it feels forced, even on the hardest difficulty the soundtrack just didn't match the experience on screen.

I was still going to play it through in hopes it just needed to 'click' but unfortunately my game save randomly corrupted part way through and I don't want to slog through the early levels again; especially as it seems like the same game save issue is still present in the sequel.

I might come back to it someday; but as it stands, it's not for me."
keeps crashing
its a real shame theres multiplayer achievements
"who decided to name this game ""doom"" like wow thats a great idea now everyone will have to clumsily tack the year 2016 onto the word everytime they mention its existence

in other news this game was way too overproduced and as a result is incredibly difficult to run, pretty much universal agreement about the banger soundtrack though, and for what its worth the visual design in the game is pretty good, gameplay i cant comment on because i havent ever reached that part and never will until i get an ibm quantum supercomputer that i can run these games on even though i shouldnt have to go that far"
"Gameplay is pretty fun.

Awful UI. Mouse keeps flying off to the second monitor invisibly and using scrollwheel would affect unfocused windows, fullscreen or borderless makes no difference. Overall just frustrating user experience

Would probably play for longer if the devs weren't lobotomized when making the pc port. Not fun when I have to spend more time troubleshooting than actually shooting demons."
"Im a fan of old fps games like doom 1 and doom 2, so i thought it would be fun to try the newer doom too. I was promised epic and unique gunfight but i got lied to. There is nothing special about the gameplay, its just WASD + M1 (and sometimes F) . It's really repetitive and i got bored after the first 10 minutes. There's nothing unique about the movement too. Also there are a lot of sections where you have to look for something, like an entrance or a key, which is boring. The only positive i can say about this game is that the soundtrack is really good and the cutscenes are really fun to watch."
Not very engaging and slow. Also uses way more system resources than it has any right to.
No microtransactions to be seen. This is a no-go for me.
"4/10 its no doom eternal
- repetitive combat 
- bland level design"
"Beautiful graphics, and smooth gameplay. However it just doesn't scratch that itch as a first person shooter. Navigating the map is frustrating, as it can be confusing, but mostly because you are going to be jumping from one platform to the next - over and over again. Combat is basically where enemies spawn in a specific area, and besides the ranged enemies, the rest force you to run around, making sure you don't fall off the cliff while you use the same close range weapon that you have been using from the start - regardless that you have others, because they just aren't effective enough at close range. I suppose this game is just not my type, when I'm more focused on where I am, then what or how I'm going to kill something. There is fun to be had with this game, but I'm not hooked enough to even rely on the story to push me to the end."
A positive review is not available in your region.
"Honestly never been a huge fan of mindless killing of enemies that put up no chance to fight back, even on hurt me plenty difficulty, and the heavy metal with slaying demons gets old pretty fast imo, going through the missions and getting the collectibles and finding all the secrets is honestly the best part of this game for me"
"killing demons on ""mars"" , yea so exciting and not repetitive and boring

Overwhelmingly Positive LOL"
"I don't understand the hype around it. The gameplay is just boring.
Weightless story, very simple and repetitive combat.
Weapons are inaccurate, you just spam and play with the timing of your attack.
Shoot, F, Shoot F, Shoot F, Shoot F."
"Это буквально худшая игра в истории, веселее крапиву бить палкой чем играть в это, хуже чем это я еще не видел игр. Если бы я только вышел из пещеры и Doom оказался бы моей первой в жизни игрой, я бы просто ушел обратно жить в пещеру, все мои предыдущие негативные обзоры в стим можно даже не рассматривать, я просто не знал что бывает настолько плохо."
זין
This is closer to the first 2 games than eternal but honestly way less fun
this game is really boring both in campain and multiplayer
"Vastly overraterd, terrible map design, clunky mechanics, and gameplay that forces you to slow down"
"Something about DOOM (2016) just doesn't feel right. I also don't understand the hype and positive reviews.

I've been trying to get into this game since 2016, when I bought it on Steam, found it very boring and refunded during the first level. Then on PS4 Pro, I got it as a free PS Plus game, gave it two chances, months apart, and still couldn't bring myself to finish the first level. Now I bought it on Steam again at 80% discount, finally made it to level 2 and now around the middle of it. But it doesn't feel good to play, at all. I'm not going to continue. I've given it enough chances over so many years and it is one of the most un-fun games I've had the misfortune to play.

I think DOOM 3 is still the best of all the DOOM games. It has a more suspenseful and horror feel to it that none of the other DOOM games have. This one is too much like an arcade game for my taste. And extremely tedious too, having to open the map every few seconds to make sure I am on the right path and not missing any collectibles or upgrades. It completely breaks immersion and stops the momentum."
"An extremely mediocre singleplayer fps game that overstays it welcome.

It felt like I had already experienced the entire game long before I reached the final levels. It is just way too repetitive and easy. And there isnt enough content to justify finishing the game.

A few technical complaints:
- The movement is horrid, very floaty and unresponsive
- Mouse smoothing is enabled by default and can only be disabled by editing a config file
- A lot of weapons slow down your mouse sensitivty, this is unacceptable (and there is no way to disable it)
- Very buggy"
I am not going to lie I am at the start of the game and its kind of trash for now.
"This game is super over rated. 

After playing the game for 6.3 hours here are my cons and pros:

Cons:
- This game is a major collectathon, majority of upgrades are locked behind finding secrets, there are guards bodies that are usually hidden and involve constantly checking the map to try and find them, or the upgrade drones, those are less hidden but some are still tucked away. 
- The reviews (let me explain). This game has 132,632 reviews with a 95% rating at the time of writing. Only 51% percent of people have made it to the 5th mission in the game. I made it to there in 4.5 hours so most people under 3.5 hours probably haven't even made it there (I probably spent an hour or more collecting collectibles). A steam user named NourTheNegacy has left a review at 3 hours and has not made it to the 5th mission. I just don't feel like people with low hours in the game should be leaving reviews in a title, I only have 6.3 but at least I made it almost halfway through the game.
- The enemies. I just felt the cast of enemies to be super uninspiring. You have to basic guys the imps and the walker guys, then they introduce the soldiers which are like buffed up imps, then the bigger hulk demons that are just stronger walker guys, It just adds upgrades to the enemies without them feeling that different, the big fat guys feel like an soldier that can take more bullets but the attack is pretty much the same.
The pros
- The gun play is good. I enjoyed the fights except for the lack of enemy diversity, but the guns felt good I never felt unstoppable at any point but I felt I could take the enemies on.

Overall I am tired of writing I hope doom eternal is better and doesn't have upgrades locked behind secrets. I give this a 5.5/10."
I can't recommend this game to anyone.  It doesn't launch anymore.
"Awesome game, bought for the multiplayer. It is just a shame they don't have servers in South Africa so we have to play on EU servers at a disadvantage. That is the only reason I am giving this game a thumbs down. When that changes let me know and I'll give it a thumbs up."
Game is just a buggy mess
"the middest thing ive ever played, tbh this game probably goes hard af if you're a 90 IQ redditor"
"I played DOOM Eternal before buying this game. I absolutely loved Eternal: it had great movement and level desing, the combat was fun and over all the gameplay felt really good. This game however felt just the opposite: the combat was boring, all the levels were re-skins and used the same 5 assets, it was hard to figure out where you should go as everything looked the same and the parkour was basically non-existent. 

Overall, I hated the experience. (and yes I have 5.1 hr currently, but I have almost beaten the game and seen most of it)"
this game is by no means bad it just isnt a lot like the first two DOOM games which can create a lot of dissapointment. however this game is starting to grow on me its worth a try i just exprextd DOOM and got something more simalar to games like halo
"Impressive game done with a lot of attention to detail.
That being said, I just didn't want to keep playing.
It's good at everything, except intriguing."
Boring
"Just my two cents...

The handful of times I've played DOOM (with a fair break in between), I've been left underwhelmed. I don't know what it is, because there can be no doubt that it is a well developed title - the reviews alone speak for for that - but perhaps I just don't like the fast paced shooting or movement, amongst other things.

Despite the the music, visuals (for 2016), and gore being positives, I feel everything else is just OK. All things being equal this makes the game great for most people, but for me there aren't clear standouts that make me think ""Whoa, this is something else"".

I feel obliged to keep giving DOOM a chance because the discourse around it is so extremely positive.

Again, I cannot discount the 95% positive reviews because I can see why it would be loved, but I just don't feel the same way. To each their own, as they say."
"Good campaign. Good multiplayer that's tragically dead, only populated really by cheaters."
4/10. the optimization is great but the gameplay is just meh
"As a long time DooM fan. totally missed the point of DooM and the theme aesthetic. Can tell it is a modern game and not made by the iD devs who started the franchise. Too boring unfortunately, I actually waited till midnight to get a physical copy. Too boing and I cant be stuffed finishing it. Brutal DooM is better."
boring ash
"While the game might be fun, I keep running into a bug that makes it so my weapons don't shoot. In the first mission. Can't progress and it happens even in new games.

Since the game is unplayable for me, I cannot recommend this."
game lists windows 7 compatibility but does not work on 7 anymore generating 12+ dll errors when attempting to open on 7. i should not need college degree in programming to run the game on a listed supported platform. If you care about running games on vintage platforms avoid Bethesda products.
awful game
pretty fucking boring
Terrible
"I really don't get what people see in this game, especially now that we have Eternal. Doom 3 perfected the horror aspects of the franchise, and Eternal the arcade gameplay aspect. Doom 2016 stands on a crossroad, being neither as good as a horror Doom variation, nor as an arcade one. It's gameplay loop is basic and flat compared to Eternal's, you just spam super shotgun, not only because it's the most powerful weapon (and with 2016's basic loop you don't have to strategize and worry about ammo), but also beacuse it's the only one in 2016 that feels good to shoot with. Seriously, I feel like I'm using some water guns here not the real deal, it's the weakest shooting of Id Software's more ""modern"" titles (Doom 3, RAGE and Eternal all have way better gunplay)."
Marty Stratton
Can't skip cutscenes on a 2nd playthrough LOL. Unless you're playing on the highest difficulty.
"A warning to we who enjoy FPS with manual saves and who do not like puzzles and loathe platforming. 
This is not a game for you.

Checkpoint save only with challenging platforming....no way will I replay an area because I miss one jump.

Puzzles sometimes require traversing the entire map and many that are only solvable thanks to google search.....frustration and boredom.

Otherwise a very good run and gun first person shooter.
But its not for me."
I'm not sure if this is an FPS or a Super Mario game because it looks like a [i]jumping puzzle simulator[/i]. That's all I gotta say
"The first FPS I ever played, on the family IBM computer, back in 1996 was Final Doom, and this garbage made me download DOOM+DOOM II instead;
-the gun play is trash, the first ""pistol"" you get feels like a water gun.
-the shotgun look, and feels, like some clunky fake science fiction Nerf gun that makes random sound effects when you pull the trigger.
-the ""execution"" mechanic is the only fun combat, but gets really repetitive when its the only fun way to engage in combat over and over and over again.
-Destiny 2, with all of its lame silly-billy DEI nonsense, still has better combat, and is a much better example of a corridor shooter."
"I really want to like it, to give it another try, etc...
...but every time I find myself wanting to uninstall it and go play quake 1 and 2 campaigns.

Im a simple individual who likes run and gun. 
If you start adding upgrades, finishers, locked areas and just way too much eyecandy my interest decays.

Like a dish with way too many spices."
Pretty much just a music player
"pathetic developers, game goes down to 60fps on high refresh monitors 

devs still havent fixed this issue after all these years, shame on you"

"As somebody that is a completionist / achievement hunter, I cant possibly recomend this due to the multiplayer."
"This was compatible with Windows 7, however, they have ""Pray I don't alter it any further.""ed it to require windows 10 via XInput 1.4.  Ehh.  MS Be MS'in."
"I tried so many times to play this game, its a cycle of deciding to get through it, play for a few minutes, die several times in a dumb way in a single area, get mad at the limited player movement or randomly getting instakilled by a tiny creature I could crush with my pinky irl, and drop it for months. I'm literally at the end and can't push through and finish"
"If you already previously purchased the game and have it sitting in your library, absolutely, go enjoy it. Phenomenal game.

However, until Marty Stratton is no longer at the company, I cannot in good faith recommend the purchase of this game.

https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce"
"If you have a moment, boot the game up and turn the music off for your next gameplay session.  That's Mick Gordon who's missing, the composer and musician for DOOM (2016) who has been honing that sound since 2014 with Killer Instinct and Wolfenstein: The New Order.  There has been some controversy in the press about treatment of Mick during DOOM Eternal's development which you can find online in great detail.

The mistreatment of artists and freelance musicians is becoming more common, most likely due to a wide imbalance of power that has them feeling lucky that they even have work at all.  I've spoken to other game musicians and heard their stories of experiencing the same treatment.  The Cohen Brothers movie ""Barton Fink"" goes a little deeper if you'd like to understand the issue in more depth.

While things most likely won't change soon, I'd just like to speak out as a fan of Mick's work and how he was treated during the development process of DOOM Eternal.  Regardless, his hard fought work is a part of new DOOM as much as id tech.  You can turn the sound back on now, leaving it off while playing is against Article 3 of the Geneva Convention anyway."
"This game is so vastly overrated I don't even know where to start. The thing that stands out to me the most is how buggy everything is. From random spikes in damage, wonky hit boxes, frequently getting stuck on or falling through geometry, BFG rounds just dispersing without doing damage, getting launched into the air from hitting a ledge awkwardly, or getting blown backward by my own weapons glitching, the list just goes on and on. This was everything just observed from a standard play though without even really pushing the game too hard so I can't imagine how many more bugs lie waiting under the hood. 

This game is not even that complex and yet they seem to have fumbled the most basics of balance when it comes to damage, movement, and level design. Has no right to bear the DOOM name."
goes from fun to tedious at some point
"Probably the only purchase on my account I regret buying.

It's by no means a bad game, in fact, after playing almost all of the Doom games except for eternal this is probably one of the best, despite that, it's just not my thing.
Maybe my brain has began to rot from too much ultrakill but it felt awfully slow to play sometimes, even on higher difficulties and trying to use all the weapons, the truth is that most of the time you only use like 3.
It didn't really felt like what it seemed to be from reviews and trailers, even while trying to play on a reckless way on purpose, I found myself having to look often through the map to find things to make me stronger instead of running into them or earning them, aside from a couple challenges and objects you are almost forced to get. 
This wasn't terrible to play and again, by no means a terrible game, but for something to be called fast-paced and chaotic it got awfully tedious at some parts.

TLDR; Good game but just not for me"
2025 I cant skip intro))))
Just no
"I wanted to play Doom as a fps horror, playing as a badass, heavy armored Space Marine. 
Instead, i played a non-stop jumping Fortnite guy.
All weapond feel the same weight, no impact sensation."
Having to get through Checkpoints is so f.....g anoying!
"Too little ammo, boring finisher animation which ruins the dynamics and flow. I thought this game was about fun, but for me it ended up being too tedious"
"wish I could have played this game, but there's a forced arbitration clause in the EULA."
"Game file inexplicably corrupted 3 levels from 100 percenting it. It's a fun game don't get me wrong but, that'll take the wind out of anyone's sails."

boring combat
"I don't like this game. I only put 15ish hours in it when it launched because we hadn't had a Doom game on PC in over a decade. The mechanics are boring, and I hate the glory kill the most of all. I mean, it's cool the first 20 times or so, but I'd prefer it if the guns just sucked less. I don't enjoy taking myself out of the action to upgrade the weapons with a weak crafting mechanic, or having to chase down drones to find some buff. Yay, give me a cool ass chainsaw and then tell me I have to go looking for a gas can every 2 kills. The levels feel small and uninteresting, I'm just running in circles in the same places like this is Quake III Arena and these demons are a bunch of AI noobs. And why do I have to chase these demons down all of the goddamn time? Why are they running from me? I'm the one that is supposed to be running and crying for my mommy, not the other way around. I just spun this up for like an hour today, because I literally forgot that it existed. I panicked slightly, thinking I had confused my hatred for Doom Eternal with a good game, but no, I hate this one too."
Snother piece of shit.

"First Doom i played was Doom 3, i remember it as horror - shooter. There is no horror element in this what is kinda sad. Just fast paced shootings and guitar riffs. Not exactly what i imagined. Will work for many. Not for me sadly."
"This game makes me so incredibly motion sick, I have tried everything I can to be able to play. 
It seems like it would be a really fun game.
If you are easily prone to motion sickness, Stay away!
Wish I could play to enjoy it. 
Not enough accessibility options to make playable."
The game constantly crashes after the second mission.  Looks like it's been an ongoing issue for some PC players for years with no fix concrete fix available.
"Constantly interrupting the pace of combat with 2 second long ""glory kill"" gets incredibly boring, very fast. Removing control from the player in a game that should encourage quick thinking and fast reflexes dulls the flow of action, and tying that mechanic down with the healing system makes it impossible to ignore it. 
The big macho man powertrip on a press of a button actually produces the reverse effect and is yawn inducing.

On a more subjective note, the music is headache-inducing but that's just my reaction to it and i'm sure it's great for some people out there, all the more power to them.

Game has other issues but i cant be arsed to even mention them cause i quit after an hour out of boredom.

I've heard the sequel solves a lot of issues from this one so i'm willing to give it a shot sometime, but until then it's back to ULTRAKILL"
"firing the plasma rifle reduces your mouse sensitivity. in a game where aim is important, why would you randomly change my mouse dpi for some weapons but not others???? also if you want to remove this stupid ""feature"" you have to install mods which will either ban you from multiplayer or prevent you from getting achievements which is just awesome"
"Unskippable cutscenes unless you nuke the videos folder. >:(
Unskippable in-game cutscenes. >:(

I tweaked the graphics, then sat around and did nothing for ten minutes while some donkey heehawed. So then I nuked all the videos from drive so I could PLAY THE GAME. Reload the game but have nothing to do, again, while an in-game cutscene happens. BORING. Fifteen seconds of actual blam-blam follows, and then another freaking in-game cutscene with some blah blah and DoF and whatever. Indicative of the remainder? Probably. Fun? No. No.

F*** THAT. Not worth it. Better DOOMs exist. REFUND!

Oh right, and plenty of ads on the main menu. Also, the main menu itself is not designed well despite the ads.

Three-and-change USD on sale and I want every cent back. 
THAT'S how much wasting my time bothers me. For that piddly amount. I've had more fun doing this dumb review than the hours spent downloading dozens of gigabytes for locale support I didn't select, videos I didn't watch, non-gameplay I didn't non-play, ads for products I don't want, and levels with checkpoints. Oh yeah! You read that right! Unskippable junk, ads, and checkpoints too! I read there's even character unlocks! Wow! It's a freaking lovechild of EA and Bethesda (the most unholy of unions!)

Are the little moments of actual pew pew any good? People say so, but I'll never know - because I'd rather you read this review back to me verbatim and slap my face every second or third syllable. Yep. It would feel just like this game, but free. Oh, and I like slow things. I love simulators. I love fast things too. Like DOOM, well, not this DOOM. But my point is that fast should be fast, and slow should be slow. Get it? I don't want to be plotting out a block of little row-houses and the mouse goes *shoom* and suddenly there's a hellish explosion of gore and little mailboxes. No. Nor do I want to be punching a freaking monster in the face and then I'm refueling an ocean-liner in real-time. Nope. One or the other. Slap me. I hate this game.

Developers were sick in the head when they made this. Do not buy this one."
ADS on the Main Screen?! Greed is real -.-
doom eternal better
Literally unplayable. Boots to a black screen
:(
it's a little violent
"it's fine, i guess"
Not for me very repetitive walk to another big room kill all enemies go to another big room kill all enemies rinse and repeat completed story 5/10
"The game REFUSES to launch, always ends up telling me to write some god awful report but it wont even show my cursor so I have no idea where to write."
"heard about doom but never played it, so i decided to try it out. it feels just like any other fps. not any better or worse. i don't know why people are so hyped up about this."
"The first game i ever touched when i was way younger.. was doom. Doom 3 series was just a work of art with a story and jumpscares. It felt like the total package. They should have continued on that story.

But now... Doom, Doom eternal and Doom The dark ages.. they miss evrything that had doom 3.. Yes it looks cool but looking cool is not evrything. In my opinion people should not even touch all the doom games that don't look like doom 3."
"Too much parkor, sucks."
"Game wont work. It gets stuck on a 99 percent black loading screen. Tried everything suggested with nothing helping. Asked for my money back but Steam says I played over the allowed 2 hours. How could I have played over the limit if the game doesnt work? Anyway......i am not going to get into a fight with Steam over that amount of money. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE ISSUE WITH THIS GAME AND READ THE FORUMS BEFORE SPENDING MONEY ON THIS GAME.

PS.
Thanks for nothing Steam."
Without the nostalgic aspect this game is mediocre at best
"I love the gameplay, I love all the collectables and upgrades. I do not love random doors being shut permanently behind me as I progress through a level, preventing me from backtracking to find secrets. This fucking sucks so much. I restarted a mission twice and called it quits as apparently this issue gets worse throughout the campaign. There are no mods to fix this. I really loved playing this game but this issue is SO ANNOYING. Also for a AAA game there are some issues I would never see even in indie games"
"Doom without infinite ammo is NOT fun. 
I miss the carnage I made in DOOM 1 & DOOM 2 :-((("
"So the game is pretty awesome. Fast movement kill the baddies boomer type shooter. The best part though is also the worst part with this particular version in my opinion. The music kicks all kinds of ass and the guns sound awesome...sometimes. Sound and music is such a big part of this game and my audio went from bass and punchy to making me double and triple check headphones didn't break on me. I tried multiple headsets and my laptops own internal speakers. The audio glitches were in game. And EVERY TIME it took me out of the experience.

I can recommend doom elsewhere just not on pc, for me it was way way to distracting."
to short i finished it in four hours but the online was good for a game that is not design for it and in sum missions they are way too open
I have played all versions of the original Doom and completed them at all levels. This game is so hard even on easy and the trials and Challenges are also difficult. I have not enjoyed playing this and thanks to a walk through I got as far as I am now. Although I have managed to complete the game and the bosses are hard but it is possible to do.
Got it for free and its still not worth it
Making watching the same long animation a core mechanic.
"Game no longer launches after latest 'update'. But of course I can't turn updates off. Numerous time now, an 'update' has been forced upon me, which breaks something. Whereupon i must spend countless hours searching the internet for a 'fix'. Bethesda are the worst. Will never buy another game from them."
Just not my type of game. :)
Tedious and generic
"Completely demonic.
Not for anyone under 21 years of age."
"Everyone agrees Mick Gordon is fantastic, but imma be honest - there's only so much difference one guy can make when there's an entire studio trying to make the blandest shooter the world has ever seen.

The maps are generic and about as memorable as the story, which is effectively non-existent. I couldn't get myself to care for it in the slightest; it's just a pitiful excuse at a premise so you have a reason to shoot. And honestly, this is kinda what I expected - this is what I bought this game for. I just wanted some mindless action; even as someone who had never played a DOOM game before, I knew it's not gonna be the pinnacle of storytelling, so that's totally fine. 

However, what I *did* expect is to at least get some decent gunplay in return. There's little to no feedback present in this game; both for your outgoing shots or your incoming damage. This makes this game, despite the performance being fantastic and the movement being responsive, incredibly frustrating and almost wonky to play. 

The level design is also extremely forgettable. While the maps might not be ""ugly"" per se, there's simply nothing going on and every environment just transitions into the next in a blur, leaving you with what FEELS like the same experience over and over again. Not only is there a severe lack of memorable set pieces, but the maps are also incredibly annoying to navigate. I'm all for a good challenge in video games, but if the hardest challenge is you trying to get from point A to point B, I can only blame poor design more than anything else. Not only are the environments (especially ledges) super inconsistent in what can and cannot be climbed, but every single layout is simply confusing to traverse as well. This wouldn't be a problem if this game at least had a good (mini)map, but I genuinely found myself pressing tab to peek at the map every other step.
Genuinely. DOOM might actually have the worst map I have ever seen in any video games. The 3D mode is awkward and confusing, the 2D mode is... awkward and confusing. That's honestly the only two words I need to describe it. The map icons aren't easily distinguishable or even recognizable, seeing the map's layers in 3D mode is simply annoying and reminds me of shitty late 2000s sci-fi games, and the 2D mode is lowkey unusable due to most maps having a lot of vertical overlap. Overall it just feels infuriating to even get a hang of this game in the first place as a beginner.

Also, to me pretty much all enemies feel the same, but I don't want to elaborate and put any more time into this review. I just wish there was a bit more to them than running, gunning, and *occasionally* dodging projectiles. I quit after the third mission, so maybe I missed out on the good parts that caused this game to attain an Overwhelmingly Positive rating, but I guess I won't be around to find out"
game looks great but its just another stupid boring boomer shooter no reloaaading no running we need a doom 3 remake of this engine and graphics now that wouldd be sick but this game no  its trash
"This doesnt deserve the hype it had or still has, this game is lacking with so many things.

Platforming in this game sucks and is uselessly buggy and i would say even slow:
Majority of the maps and arenas have really garbage ledges where you wont be able to grab on properly.
If you manage to climb the ledge, you will either have to slog through painfully slow relative  to the combat climb animation or have this small step up thing with no animation and it feels like you just got teleported on top of the ledge.
Oh and dont let me start on the invisible walls or actual ledges that arent meant to be grabbed yet look like perfectly grabable, or how majority of props/crates or whatever you can get stuck on.
90% of my deaths were to these garbage maps and their death holes to fall into cause of this.

The enemy behavior and spawns are not really good either:
I wouldnt mind bullet sponges, or insta killing imps but man do the spawns suck. The known ""there is always one imp loose around"" thing would be ok, if that imps death didnt trigger another ""wave"" of enemies. Way too many times i asked ""was this all? "" and ran around just to kill the last imp and get this exact same thing on repeat multiple times.

Secrets and upgrades:
I would have enjoyed this game way more if most of my gameplay wasnt playing this game with wiki up my *ss, you can say ""thats just like the original doom did it"" but that doesnt excuse how annoying it is to find. There is also whole ""you dont need to find them all"" but that will just raise the difficulty uselessly by depriving you of what you could have had making the game less fun. There are also challenges, but those are just not fun to do. Only uselessly forcing you to play specific way if you want extra upgrades.

Multiplayer: DEAD. In rare cases you find match, just ONE cheater ruins it with no effort.

Arcade: now THIS is the fun part of the game, as its basically base game but you get all the upgrades and guns relative to the level, this is how the game should have been from start. The only time i had fun was with this mode.

The amount of guns is actually fun:
I actually enjoy the different guns and their upgrades, tho i dont enjoy the whole swapping system as its either choose buggy holding Q that will dissapear on you or get cramps after playing cause i keep trying to press the buttons for the guns.

Soundtrack is REALLY GOOD... on youtube:
I dont know if im killing demons just that fast or in some weird way, but the ""music plays according to combat"" thing just doesnt seem to work for me. I keep getting random cut offs, the arenas also seem to not have enough demons for music to actually start getting good and it results in music starting its hype up section and then just cuts off. Or its just repeating few of same sounds on repeat.

Difficulty: Im unable to finish the game in Ultra nightmare due to the game buggy nature, i also dont enjoy how the game strips you of all your upgrades where you have to once again play with wiki unless you remembered the secrets, having you play with stripped down doomguy after being used to be fully upgraded to half of the game just isnt fun.
There is also the whole ""remove save on death"" thing, which would make sence if it also didnt activate on exiting. I would have enjoyed just the level restart way more than the whole game cause while i do enjoy playing this on the hardest, i dont have up to whole hour at a time to finish the level. But this is more of a personal issue than anything.

As for my bugs encountered counter:
amounts of ""ledge grab? nah"": litellary stopped counting in the tower level, the level afterwards also just sucked with this.
Enemies just not spawning: 3 times, all in the destroy coolers for VEGA arena.
Grenade throwing locking up my gun or gun wheel or vice versa where shooting guns didnt let me throw grenade: This appeared so often i didnt use grenades for first half of the game and rarely afterwards.
Clipping out of map/into something: 10, the glory kills sure are buggy with positioning.
Save corruption: 3, the game does NOT enjoy being closed mid level

Overall, majorly dissapointing for the amount of ""play it, its fun"" i got from people.

TL:DR
There is buggy platforming in my doom, yuck"

"Game itself is great but the Multiplayer mode is unplayable because of the numbers of cheaters and hackers in there, and neither Steam nor ID seems to care or take any action against them. There are many many complaints on Steam and all over the internet about this, and nothing seems to have been done to correct it. What kind of Software company would make a game that allows cheats and hacks in multiplayer mode? Reflects very poorly on your companies and makes me not want to purchase games from these people again."
"This is a terrible game because it is so god damned DIFFICULT!!!!!!!!! Even on the easiest setting. It takes forever to kill a monster with guns, they are too fast and agile, and outnumber you constantly. And you constantly fall off of things and die. Or you get trapped in a place you can't get out of, so you have to restart the game. I'm constantly restarting this fucking game!!!"
No one played multiplayer online this game
yeah never played it
"[h1] TL;DR: [/h1]
If You're here to mindlessly kill demons You will have a good time, the game is pretty fun, it looks and feels good (for the most part); However if You're an ""art person"" like me, (AKA you [b] care [/b] about the overall experience, besides the technical side) definitely [b] don't waste your time on this. [/b]
[h1] My Experience [/h1]
So the game is OK, controls are very responsive, graphics hold up pretty well, the story, although the way that is told is not good at all, is somewhat interesting; it just did not change Me in any way. Besides the absolute bangers by Mick Gordon (Which You can listen to in various platforms), it brings NOTHING new to the table, there's better and cheaper ways to have a good time shooting mindlessly.
And that's the good part about it, that the game is MID (at best), you know ""mediocre"" doesn't mean bad right? well it's all downhill from there, when I say the story is somewhat interesting I mean the [u] subject [/u] is interesting, the whole [spoiler] humanity now lives in mars and it has developed a way to use the energy from hell [/spoiler] main plot is OK, i'd watch a movie about that, but when I say the way that is told is not optimal I mean the game was a bit over 20Hs for me, and it is boring, a game that should be epic is boring af, the pacing is awfulI, no development at all, straight up ruins the ""interesting"" subject played it because I didn't wanna play Eternal without the backstory, now I don't know if i wanna play Eternal at all.
I mean I might give Eternal a try, but if in my first 2 hours of gameplay I see the same amount of Enemy repetition and weird difficulty bumps I will drop it. if the game would've ended on the second to last mission it would've been better.
Just to clarify, i'm not angry, i'm tired, i'm thankful the game ended so I could uninstall it, and I hate when that happens, I like to finish a game and keep thinking about its story, its characters, the things that I've just experienced, about what's to come on a sequel, or where can I find more [b] of [/b] it, or more [b] like [/b] it. but sadly this was not the case, this game's over and I'm thankful, I won't replay it anytime soon, not to say most likely never.
and usually if I wouldn't play the game all over again, why would I recommend it? there's very few games that I really like and still wouldn't play again.
[h1] To wrap things up [/h1]
[h3] Pros: [/h3]
•gameplaywise is a solid 8/10. (controls work properly, UI/UX is pretty decent, idk)
•soundtrack is on top, Mick Gordon I love you, although I'm not always in the mood for this genre 9.5/10
•graphics hold up fairly well, solid 8/10 too.
•the subject of the story is pretty cool ngl 7/10.
[h3] Cons: [/h3]
•the way the story is told and the things that happen in it are so forgetable 4/10.
•you're gonna see the same 7 enemies all throughout the game, some with some variations and depending on the zone you might see this one or this other, but it's the same enemies all over the place and past the 1st half of the game believe me it gets old 3/10 (just because the animations are pretty cool)
•the difficulty has some werid ""bumps"" it suddently gets harder, but after that one enemy it's easy again, and although I like difficult games I don't find that funny at all 2/10. (also putting the same enemies in the same order 3 times in a row on the last mission is not a challenge is artificial difficulty and it's not hard, it's boring).
[h3] Conclusion: [/h3]
5.9/10 MID
doesn't say anything to my hungry for art heart."
outdated movement and mechanics
"Don't buy any games that Marty Stratton has been part of, until he changes his ways (i.e. never). 
Mick Gordon deserved better.

Game's fine, but I find it overrated in the gameplay.
I completed it, tried doing a new game+ and got overwhelmed with tedium.

If you want a different doom experience, check out the MyHouse.wad that can be played with GZDoom."
CYBERDEMON BOSS IMPOSSIBLE AT LOWEST LEVEL
"The game unfortunately does not respond when you try to launch it and outputs a black screen. This is probably due to software factors such as drivers. I am currently using an AMD Radeon GPU with the 24.5.1 drivers installed. This isn't the first time Radeon drivers have had problems launching games, especially games from Bethesda... This game is pretty much modern and is extremely well optimized, sad to see driver issues related to modern games like this gem."
"Honestly really underwhelmed, can't continue further. Everything is a bullet sponge. You dont feel powerful at all. Hated every minute of gameplay. Menu and UI is horrid."
not hard. annoying
I dont like it
"Damage sponge bad combat = no fun, i think if i made games it is fun you cheater optimized game devs aren't fun"
"Doom 2016 is stylistically appealing, and that's where the game's charming qualities end. Glory kills are phenomenally rendered, the art direction is excellent, and the aesthetics presented are crisp. The game-play is bland and repetitive, however. The lore is drivel, the story beats are bland hero complex enabling nonsense, and the movement is atrocious. Invisible walls, shitty map triggers, uninspired boss fights and a meaningless story that banks on aesthetics and repetitive guitar riffs to invest the audience leave this a forgettable game."
"I don't know, this game isn't really for me. I heard good things etc. and the reviews speak for themselves. But honestly, it isn't for me. It's so boring. It does look nice, the kill/finisher moves are dope. But it's just running around shooting."
"no idea why this has ""overwhelmingly positive"" on steam reviews.
if this wasnt doom, but some noname game this would struggle with mixed id guess.

pros:
- music
- runs smoothly with okayish graphic

cons:
- the checkpoints
like wtf, why is there no save option. the game has ""secrets"" (more on that later) but punishes you for exploring - ""oh, youve cleared the area of all enemies and now go exploring, but fall of a ledge because the game fails to communicate which ledges are grabbable? here go back 10-15minutes and clear them again""

- damage feedback
there is none noticeable, neither when you get hit, or when you hit enemies - many fights ended with ""why am i at 20% hp? i didnt get hit at any point?!?""

- the guns + sounds
none of them stand out, you feel like shooting with an airsoft with most of them - also have fun having a different ammo pool for each one of them so dont get too accustomed to any of them.

- secrets/map design
all secrets are visible via the map - even through walls and without having spotted them before. dont go exploring, the game will punish that with the brilliant checkpoint design. if you ever see a platform/rails/whatsoever below you which look like there might be hidden something there - dont drop there - while theyre walkable they are just a deathtrap because you cant get up again (have fun reloading the checkpoint and clearing the area again ;) ) - if the game doesnt show a secret there, theres none.

- health
finishing an enemy will only drop health if you have low health - but always slightly less than you need. just annoying."

"After so many years sitting in my backlog, I've finally decided to play this game. Oh well, now I remember why I stopped. Game design is Infuriating, combat is boring and its just aint fun. I wanted to try Ethernal if that would be better but Bethesda  and their anti-customer idiocy (req. acc) made me to refund it, so I will rather go play UT or Doom classic than this."

In practice it's better as a workout soundtrack than a video game.
cannot sex the demons D:
Twice I've tried to play this game and twice I've gotten to the same spot unable to figure out where to go next. Who designed these levels? Madmen??
"I don't know if I'm weird or something but I just don't get the hype. from what I've played the gunplay feels super weak and there's no reason to use anything other than the shotgun. switching weapon mods is criminally slow, and yeah you can upgrade your suit to make all actions faster, but I don't get why they made it so damn slow in the first place. there is also legitimately ZERO damage feedback, you can get hit for like 20 damage and you can't even tell unless you look at your health bar. the game also looks like someone pissed all over the screen, and the maps are way too big and easy to get lost in cause there's no visual variety, and the map screen is somehow even more confusing... and the story is shoved down your throat for whatever reason? this is doom, why should I give a damn about the story? overall I just don't get it... I might give it another try but from what I've seen it seems very repetitive and unsatisfying"
ceeps  laging
"Just here to say that despite ""Overwhelmingly positive"" this game isn't gonna be everyone's thing.

I got 4 hours in and did not find the combat very enjoyable. 

Maybe it gets better... but I probably won't return to it."
ok
"mastery/level ""challenges"" and waiting for dialog every time I replay a level make me want to stop playing this game and go actually skin demons in real life"
"boring, running and doing the same shit."

"This is definitely bethesda trash. If you enjoy it, I get it. But for me I dont like spending hours looking for ""secrets"" only to need to get on youtube to find things that dont serve any purpose. The trials suck. And the thing that made me uninstall was getting to the BFG just for all the BS to get the thing. I already wasted 10 hours playing it just to jump through spit and giggle hoops... Nah this aint it for me. Cant call it COMPLETE crap but it isnt something I feel I would want to play again even though thats what this game was made for."
"Every time i try to play this, I get bored. It’s like a corny action movie from the 90s. It just knocks me out."

great game. Cyberdemon boss fight ruins it. I was having fun too.
"ID are an amoral bunch of D Bags to say the least for the way they treated Mick Gordon over Doom Eternal and I will not purchase a single one of their games every again and guess what I am still going to play them if I want to. We can all have the same attitude as them and take what we want and give what we feel like. I also suggest to anyone who wishes to play doom;

They deserve none of your money.

By all means read up on Mick Gordon yourself but I believe we should all as consumers be doing as much as we possibly can to drive anti consumer and amoral companies into the ground by using them and giving them as little as possible."

"Such a bad fucking game. I got stuck multiple times, not because I couldn't kill the enemies, but because I was literally trapped behind objects and even flew out of the map. Just play Doom Eternal its worlds better."
"overrated , maybe , i will give her a chance ."
"my grave is unspeakable I played the first 8 hours of this game perfectly normal and I really enjoyed every second of it but out of the blue the game stopped launching with me, someone please help me i had this problem for months and i literally reinstalled the whole game and it still wont work"
"A lot of good things about this game, but I cannot recommend it when there is just so much that is utterly fucking infuriating, such as when you fall to your death thinking you can climb onto a ledge that is exactly the same as all the other climbable ledges, except this one isn't and instead you can fall to your death.  Not interested in wasting my time for a game that cannot get its shit together and be consistent and functional.  Also shockingly poorly thought out keyboard layout, but at least that is able to be remapped."
now that I have fully completed the game and I still don't like it but I no longer hate it
Really bad you cant save games at all. If you get stuck on a boss you have to start the whole level over.
"Hit scanning through walls

"I like this game glory kill demon, but too shame this game already cheating are everywhere and i cannot find join in multiplayer. I just need play more games, but i wasted my time for not finding this games multiplayers."
"Played for a few days, forgot about the game for a month or two, played again today, save is deleted."
"I could see how someone who is a fan of turning their brain off and shooting things for no reason for a few hours might love this game... I bought it expecting an action packed story with good game play. Instead I struggled to deal with how fast everything was, how confusing the maps were, how light and infrequent the story played a part, and how the gore kills were treated.

Specifically with the gore kills, I was at first excited that the game featured elements outside of simple run-and-gun systems, having animation tied to combat, I thought, would have amped up the ""fun"" of the gun-play. And it would have been FINE if they were used as added flavor to the game play, but considering health and ammo are tied to doing them, and there are a limited number of animations to see when doing them, it got old in literally 2 hours of play. Which sucks because this feels like a key feature.

What doesn't help is most people I talked with regarding the quality of the game either told me that the story gets good once I get well into Doom Eternity, or suggested that I turn the difficulty up more if I were bored of the experience. And if difficulty of play is the only reason to enjoy this game then it suggests only those who care about pure FPS mechanics over any and all other factors are the intended demographic. I'm sure it's fantastic for many people, but don't let the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" rating fool you if you have certain priorities for your games."
"this game cuts out all audio when i boot it up, and now i can't listen to my 10 hr long retrospective on two handed kitchen utensils while playing this dog shit game."

"Lacks everything that made the original good. I'm not sure how you could make a game like Doom ""too gamey"", but somehow they managed it. The extremely limited ammo, bullet sponge trash enemies, and enemies that basically require a specific weapon to kill... Just, no. This isn't Doom."

"it's extremely mid, doing the same thing over and over again till the end of the game! Maybe fun for the 1-2hr but later on i have to force my self playing just to finish it. 

This is the first modern game ever that i have to switch off Hardmode at 80%, not because it was too hard but simply because i just feel like it's not worth it and just want it to be done with."
my save has been corrupted? why??
"play this if you think the sequel's too fast for you
even then it's lacking in enemy variety, there are extremely few boss fights and more than a few awful platforming sections"
if this game is so good then why does everyone have like 3 hours played?
meh
"Still unsolved trophy glitches in 2024? come on...

Game is fun though :P"
Fuck Bethesda.
i have zero weapon sound
"There is so much to like about this game, however, from the moment I witnessed the mechanics of ripping open enemies for resources, it was a pass for me.

I tried and tried over the years, but just can't. Know what I mean?

Perhaps in the future, something in me will go ""ah, yeah, ok."", but for now it is an hard pass."
Too many idiotic puzzles.
"This isn't a bad game by any means, it's a really good one, graphics are amazing and it runs great for an AAA title. I'm finding it to be just... kind of boring? It's intense and all, that's cool, and I love the grenade shotgun upgrade thingy. Other than that though, I haven't been able to get very hyped about this game for some reason. I guess I like Ultrakill more. rip :("
"Doom is a great return to form, all while creating something new. But as of recent, after being purchased, Microsoft is trying to mass replacing their employees (artists, animators, designers, etc.) with AI, even as going as far as to shut down other studios all just to avoid paying a small amount of money to actual humans.
DO NOT SUPPORT MICROSOFT."
"I don't understand how this game got Overwhelmingly Positive. It feels like a joke. Each encounter is as flaccid as the next. I can count maybe 3 that were actually engaging because they had the balls to spawn more than 5 enemies. So many zones are wasted on what ends up being 2-3 enemy packs. And the cherry on top of the cake is how the game showers you with supplies so you never have any issues dealing with problems. The game does the music a disservice because the moment you think you actually get to hear the song of the stage it just turns out to be tied to the two mobs they spawned that you kill in 5 seconds. 

Flaccid."
"Imagine that you know Leonard Shelby from Memento, and he describes Doom to you after playing it. I forgot to mention that you also have a learning disability. This would be what you would create from his description. Also, the renderer choices are OpenGL or Vulkan. This game doesn't deserve a chance."
"I don't like it. It isn't fun. It has nothing to do with the classic Doom; it is just another shooter. They ramped up the graphics and the story, and that which killed the game itself. Also it is unclear what to do, where to go, which is an unnecessary change in the game. Also fights are repetitive, like ticking some boxes to fill up the time."
Too unstable.
"it plays great on linux / steam deck however I didnt enjoy it very much. The gameplay is good but the setting and story just killed it for me. I rushed through it to just so I could uninstall it. It gets repetitive very quickly.

If you're into hell as a setting and metal music then pick it up otherwise id recommend halo mcc when its on sale."
badgered by steam for a review
"First and foremost, I have spent a lot of time playing competitive shooters. I played a good bit of Doom Eternal (I have enjoyed the hell out of it [no pun intended] and am normally not one who plays a lot of singleplayer games at all tbh), beating the base campaign and 2 dlc's in nightmare mode, and at some point wanted to get my hands on Doom 2016 so I could have a real opinion on it since there is a lot of discourse. This game was on sale for 4 dollars when I bought it so I thought that it would be perfect time to get it and play through it. Honestly, I did not have that great of a time. Maybe a part of it was that I played it on the wrong difficulty without realizing somehow (hurt me plenty instead of nightmare) but even on the easier difficulty it just felt annoying and tedious to play to me. I really wanted to enjoy this game, but ultimately it did not do it for me. I respect what this game did for the franchise, and I definitely enjoyed some of the scenery and overall and visceral+darker feel of the game but it does not even come close to Eternal for me. Even with Eternal's imperfections, I believe it truly innovated on its predecessor to the point in which 2016 feels lackluster and outdated (the UI especially, it just irks me a lot and makes me feel like im playing a demo, which I know is a minor nitpick but added with everything else it leaves a bad taste in my mouth). This is not to say that there are other people who won't enjoy 2016, but I definitely think anyone who loves Eternal as much as I do will feel a sense of emptiness playing through this game's campaign. Regardless, I owe my respect to everyone who made this game as I feel I probably would have enjoyed this game much more if I had played it in 2016. I think if anything, it is a good sign I feel this way about 2016 as it means that the devs are aware of its faults and how to make improvements, so that the newest Doom game will hopefully be even better than Eternal."
Too many pentagrams images and witch stuff
The damn map is unreadable
"The gameplay may be addicting and exciting, however... there's just way too much blood and gore for me... but the game is fun I will admit. It's just I cant sleep at night after playing this game XD"
lol
"This game was fun at first. Pretty fast past action shooter. but as the game goes on, the map design becomes a game of par-cor. In which your character is not well suited for. Then once you get even further the map designs become more complex with fragmented map sections that you have to teleport between. I got fed up. Combat great, map design terrible. The maps of classic doom were far better, as far as action shooters are concerned. Highly disappointed, wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."
Wow. Game was on sale so I thought I would give it a shot. This game is absolute garbage. Bugs all the time. More puzzles then fighting. The map is a joke. They really hyped this game up back in the day. Glad I didnt waste my money
"This game is a complete piece of crap. zero stars out of x.  How can you use grenades? Nope, no answer.  Any kind of map to direct you? nope. everything about this game is absolutely garbage. GARBAGE! A complete waste of money and nothing like the original game.  Total shite."
scary demon is big and mean :(
"too much platforming, not enough doom"
Game is too badass for my crappy laptop to run :(
"its shit, overrated af"
Overrated game that isn't actually very fun. Not sure how I got memed into buying this. Having to watch the same 2 animations to heal over and over again gets real old real quick. All the guns are pea shooters and have no weight to them. Go play Serious Sam or something instead of buying this.
It's so damn repetitive 😴
worst game ever made
terrible save system
na man i miss playing team fortress 2
looks like crap try to change the settings and can't even read it enough to see to change. TRASH
"Don't buy it unless you like mazes.  You'll spend 90% of your time wondering how you're going to open a door, shut off a fire, get over to the next platform, etc.  Occasionally you fight enemies.  About as fun as losing your car keys."
the definition of mediocrity
"Didn't particularly like it. I felt like I had experienced everything the game has to offer in the first two hours. Customization of the weapon seems fun, but it just provides a ""cooler way"" of killing enemies. It's game loop doesn't suit me at all. 

Furthermore, you don't feel the ""oompf"" or ""crunch"" of the guns, they all feel weak to me. 

People hailed the music as great, but it seemed just ""okay"" and not revolutionary."
"Large Parts of the game are a f........ jump & run. Did I mention that I don't like jumping? Of cause it has no quicksave , so don't spoil the last jump. Uups! Bad luck, you spoiled the last jump! The start again...and again..and again......
Very stupid game with a stupid save system.  The best about the game is, that I bought it on a sale for 5 € or so"
"its ok. Besides the combat, it feels generic so far. Not a huge fan of this art style either. The game does get more exciting with each upgrade as they do make you feel much more powerful. Not a big fan of all the climbing and platforming and trying to figure out where to go. The game takes up a ton of space and so far not sure why. I played other games very similar that take up way less. So far a lot of it doesnt feel new but the combat fun and thats what keeping me going. Overall, I think I would only recommend this to shooter lovers. Not sure if ill finish my playthrough. There not much keeping me interested."
THIS IS A GOOD GAME BUT... for some reason the game corrupted my save files and deleted all of my progress out of nowhere
the game itself is fine but this will remain a negative review until they fix how checkpoints work (i lost so much progress towards 100% cause of the checkpoints bug)
"I really thought I would like this game. It looks so action-packed and not to mention all the good reviews.
Sadly, it was a huge disappointment! I still kept on playing, to give it a fair chance to redeem itself, but it never happened!

[b]GOOD[/b]
- Good graphics!
- Music is awesome!
- Weapons are kinda cool and can be upgraded with mods.

[b]BAD[/b]
- Boring repetitive gameplay!
- Story never captured my attention.
- Just doesn't feel right. Like it's a bit slow and sluggish.
- Weapons and hands looks huge, like something you typically see on a very low FOV on a console. Increasing the FOV doesn't change the scale.
- Weapons don't have mags, which breaks the norm. Too many times I instinctually hit the R-key to reload and instead it switches the active weapon mod.
- Map design is overcomplicated and confusing. I have to constantly take a look at the map. Finding the upgrade points for the suit and weapons are just frustrating. Feels like a puzzle!
- Map doesn't show all doors / obstacles. You think you can go some where, until you arrive in front of a locked door!
- Some areas was a little too dark and there's no flashlight that I know of."
So horribly DULL. The original DOOM is somehow still better than this.
orange screen simulator
"Decent for when it came out back in 2016 but nowadays i can't recommend this simply because eternal beats it in every single shape and form to the point where it makes this game practically irrelevant, aside from it's multiplayer component which i am almost certain no one cares as it has barely any player base after 7+ years. Bullet sponge enemies with no weak points, poorly balanced weapons, even the exploring feels tedious compare to eternal, holo grenade is a certainly a joke, and the bosses are just, laughable. Weapons and weapon mods do not switch quickly, essentially handicapping the player and slowing down the pace of combat."
For some moronic reason they decided to suddenly cap this game at 60fps. Huge L.
What a P.O.S. not enough fun to try and struggle through constant crashes and saved games lost to redundant errors. Kind of come to expect it from these scumbags at this point. BETHESDA SUCKS!
"Uhhh. Please don't brutally tear me apart like those demons guys, but I'm actually not a big fan of the game. Too slow for my tastes."
single player game that logs you out to title screen when internet dies lmao
Overrated.
"tried to play this game on and off since 2018 and kept quitting every time, one of those titles that can't grab my attention no matter how many chances i gave it"
"This is one of the best video games of all time. *Do not buy it on PC.* I have yet to make it more than halfway through the game on this platform without losing my save.

On my first save, I experienced roughly 20 crashes - often from alt tabbing or another window popping up, which just completely breaks the game in Vulkan rendering mode. It has bluescreened my PC several times from these crashes. Apparently this has been a known issue since release, at this point you can assume it will never be fixed. 

Then, four missions in while attempting to 100% clear the game, the awful built in copy-protection decided my save file was corrupt. 

On my second save, I experienced fewer crashes (switched to OpenGL rendering after troubleshooting, was more mindful to not alt-tab). Not none, but fewer. I played on Nightmare and had a blast getting through the first four missions again, plus the fifth. Completed every mission 100%, tracking down the secrets. My save is once again corrupted by the awful copy protection.

This is easily one of the top 5 action games of all time, and I still wouldn't recommend a person to play it on PC. What a waste."
"access denied. runs well on the deck tho, just badly designed"
"I've fallen through the floor repeatedly to my death and I have found myself now in a room of dead corpses; the entrance still being sealed as I've seemingly bypassed the trigger. On hardcore, this is frustrating to say the least. 

I'm glad I bought this on sale."
"This does not feel like the original Doom. The level design is boring and repetitive and dull. The game doesn't allow you to manoeuver your way. Most of the areas feel cramped with monsters and allow for the same tic-tac-toe design. If the game had some variety in their level design this game would be enjoyable, but at the current state it's just lacking in a lot of ways. 4 / 10 game"
"Fuc..king hackers, u anticheat is bullshit"
"Neutral review, I unironicaly prefer the old games."
Worked fine until I got three monitors.  Screw your lame support Bethesda - yes I have the latest drivers.
"wont be buying anything from bethesda again since the mick gordon stuff, unfortunate."
"Crashed and lost all my progress for 6+ hours
So are those checkpoints for nothing????
I was getting fun, but it's not fun to replay all of this
So it seems i should reveal the ending on youtube and just leave my post here
Dunno if I should try Doom Eternal, dont want to go through this again"
"Is this a good game? The short answer is no.
Flat storyline, couldn't connect with the main character, don't even like him. He found himself on a torture table, because of magic... Wizard did it! I guess...

Demonic presence detected. I didn't felt any demonic presence for 30 minutes of playing, no excitement, no fear, nothing... Sound is bad, commercial, no art in it.

There is a planet where there are demons, so what? Let them be there, why should I kill them? Are they threatening the earth or somebody that I care, playing the main character?

Sound of the guns are bad, boring, shotgun is better, but still muted and flat, no excitement in shooting. Maybe later is better, but if 30 minutes of playing didn't do anything good, then why waste time?

Switch to old Doom, and I would rather play it than newer. At least I see the face in the health bar, some emotions are there, so I feel that it's human, not an emotional robot that I don't know, and don't care about. No art in newer Doom, music is bad, no melody, overexaggerated beats, but no flow...

Sad times, that you have millions of dollars, and a million times the polygons, and still you cannot make a better game today. Thought that it will stay on my account, but I will have to return it. 

Waster of potential..."
The game is about clicking the demons. Who the hell was this made for? I remember Doom 3 now that was a survival(horror?) shooter. This feels like it should have been a reel shooter with a light gun.
This is the only game that's ever given me motion sickness because some retardo bombardo decided to make the FOV zoom all the way in and then immediately back out again every time you interact with something. He shall perish in the eternal flames of hell as punishment for this sin.
"It sucks the story is dumb , the characters are stupid, and i hate being locked in arena's like it was going to be some other lame arena shooter and thier like hey lets make it into a cheesy doom game. when only the original ones are any good."
"This game is a broken mess, absolute garbage. Of course it's Bethesda, so what would you expect? Being ID I'd had better expectations. Apparently there was a patch some years ago that caused a black screen on launch. And they posted a pinned comment that supposedly fixes it.

Well it doesn't. Game goes from the redundant splash screen to a goddamn black screen that you can't get out of, and stops responding. This is unacceptable, it's ridiculous, and I feel like I wasted my money on this utter piece of crap. Don't waste your money on this shit."
"Nice Alien 3 aesthetic, but the contrast sucks compared to Doom Eternal. Exploration is stressful because the game only saves after clearing a room, finding a toy, or proceeding to the next giant area. Online is almost dead sometimes and it even kicked me out of a singleplayer speedrun due to a ""sign-in change"". At least it has lots of deathmatch modes, albeit the weapons feel weak."
"I spent 90% of the time looking for the right path and 10% fighting demons. This felt more like ""I´m lost""-simulator than a shooter. Not sure if this is normall or if it´s just me."
"1. The beginning of the game is too boring. 
2. The levels in Hell are much better than the levels on Mars. Half of the game I wanted to finish the levels on Mars and get to Hell, where the locations are not monotonous, cool scenery and better gunfights.
3. There are many dead-end locations in the game that feature cliffs or walls where developers could have hidden secrets or placed armour/patrons.
4. The plot is almost non-existent.
5. Movement is slow. I would like to jump and ""fly"" around the arena, like in Quake, and smash monsters in the air.

I liked the music in this game, so I give it a 5.5/10."
No
"a game for retards. jump, shoot, run, jump, shoot, run then some moronic finishing moves etc.. etc..

don't waste ur time wth this shit."
"Really not sure if should recommend or not. Decided on ""not recommended"".

Basically so it may be found for those like me.
To say it first, this game is good. You can feel the quality and passion for the old DOOM games. The intro section of the game is cool, it looks really good, runs really good, it's difficult, fast. It has collectibles and some upgrades, but nothing that distracts from the core game.
The game is great honestly, for those that like DOOM like shooters.

The problem is that I guess I don't like them or not anymore. If you like what I guess is called now ""Boomer Shooters"" this is amazing. But if you don't, maybe give this a pass. I tried but honestly I am just not really having fun playing the game... this style of shooter is not for me."
The game itself is decent but 70GB of space for like 15 levels is too much for me.
everytime i fart a bit more of my demons escape my body
"Boring exploration, nothing like classic Doom games. You're either fighting the same enemies on a horrible gated arena or busy getting the keycard from the most obvious, glowing body in the room, rinse and repeat.

Pure male violence fantasy, far away from the clever level designs one could expect from the series."
"Movement feels floaty and there's some kind of inertia that makes you slide.  

I quit playing because of jump puzzles, fall damage, and not knowing where to go.  The floaty, sliding feel makes movement too uncomfortable to the point of being unfair."
"The game is great, but the amount of errors and crashes I had is very disappointing. Starting the game and casually losing my safe was the cherry on top."
"After many years, Bethesda can't figure out how controler support works. Eat shit."
"""id softwear""? yeah, well id rather play another game
this is just menus & unskippable cutscenes; i just want to shoot gun, not read a book & watch a movie"
"Level design was atrocious. Even though the fighting was fun, the level design is so bad I can't recommend it."
surprisingly boring. almost ubisoft level of boring. in my 70 minutes of playing it i thought i was taking crazy pills because every other people on earth swear that it's good
Wheres sex
"The game is fucking broken every time i try to do the beginning of the end  the screen glitches and Im stuck looking up from the bodem of the map,"
"THEY TURNED DOOM INTO A MELEE BRAWLER.

It can't be a shooter if it doesn't give you enough ammo to shoot. Constant interruptions to shooting. The weapons are weak, and then there is not enough ammo on top of that. I really hate this game. 

Glory kills. I hate them. They take you out of the combat and take away your control. Their only purpose is to get health replenishment and to interrupt your shooting. Health packs? That used to be something. Not anymore. It didn't constantly interrupt the game, and on top of that it gave you a reason to explore the levels to find some health. It was a useful thing to look for, just like ammo and secrets, but they took that away. They think getting health from enemies eliminated taking time to find health, but now it just takes time away control from you because it puts you in an unskippable animation over and over again. Such a bad game design that gets old immediately. Immediately it sucks having control taken from you. That is not what a Doom game is. Neither is Doom 3. This is more Doom than Doom 3 is, but the gun play in Doom is so much better than it is here. Doom is the standard. Can that even be argued? The game play in Doom was so much better than it is here. Doom had you running and gunning in the purest form, the most enjoyable shooting, but here, nope, you don't get ammo, you don't get control, you have control ripped from you constantly, you don't get to shoot unless you pay the price of constant interruptions from kill animations. Constant, and I fucking mean constantly. Yet here we are, a hundred thousand Overwhelmingly positive votes.

The level design is good with non linear exploration. That is the only saving grace. The levels are fun and would be more fun to explore if you could shoot freely like a Doom game, this being not.

Everything is orange.

I hate this game

The dialog gets cringe. The whole thing is based on you being a special little guy that can do it. It's so cringe and lame. They actually talk about you like you are the chosen one. How worthless of a story did they attempt even? The Doom games had you doomed and fighting for your existence. What's wrong with that? Can we not have Doom instead of this special little guy you play as now? An ammo-less melee combatant? What in the hell do I want to melee fight for? Get out of here. I hate this game so much."
"It just wasn't my type of game. Other people might still like tho, it just wasn't for me."
RFAR
Style over substance but don't let this dissuade you from playing Doom Eternal.
"I had a blast with this game - but only on low difficulty. 
All my previous doom games I played first on low difficulty and then on almost highest (usually one without f.e. respawning enemies).
This game on Nightmare is playable, but god it's not fun at all... The 'flow' does not exist in this diffuculty. In Doom 2 I felt extremly chalanged but also having extreme fun. 

I think part in this are not so predictable enemies, very  high self damange/barrels damage, rather low character speed when compared to enemy attacks. In Doom 2 on (I think nightmare) Imps start to shoot really fast, but you still can dodge them easly if you practice, in this game Imps are not so predictable, also their projectiles travel very fast - so when they are at range it's chalanging but predictable. From medium/low distance there is now way to predict imp movement/shooting. 

Also I hate that enemies have more health on higher difficulty - that's just teribble design... I explore a lot, but when I need 2/3 shotgun shots at imp I find myself without ammo most of times. 

All in all, I would rate this game 4/10 - very enjoyable when you don't even have to consider mechanics on easier level, but when in need of more chalanging gameplay - mechanis/design fails very short."
"very underwhelming, especially considering the popularity of the franchise. I recently played Roboquest which I thoroughly enjoyed and which I heard has kind of a DOOM-ish feel to it. So considering I had this one lying around in my backlog anyway, I figured I'd give it a go and was fairly excited to do so. But right off the bat the game just kinda felt sluggish to me. It also managed to make me grow a hate for its level design even though I only played it for about 2 hrs now. Felt boring in general + annoying backtracking.

If I had to summarize in 2 words those would be: sluggish + soulless. Maybe it just wasn't meant for me I guess *shrug*

I guess I'll keep playing a bit more until I've earned the remaining card drops"
this game is good but in the first half of the campaign its very boring and unless you're motivated to keep playing then it will put you off but i enjoyed the second half of the game very much
pretty shit man
"It just makes me so nauseous. Not sure what the problem is with this game. I have over 400 hours in DOOM Eternal and no such problems. The constant quick spinning around leaves me sick for hours... Bummer. I used to play the original DOOM from Windows 3.1, so I like the series. I have tried 3 different days and each with the same result. Am writing this review to remind myself why the hours are so low. Guess I just have to stick with Eternal..."
the blood covered naked woman tried touching me at the end :(
"unpopular opinion: I don't understand why this game is so well liked. It feels just like the original with better graphics in a awfully designed mars world that feels archaic & ugly by todays standards with no immersion..I can't stand games that make you press a button every time you pick up ammo(every few enemies),& are just linear shootem ups with god awful level design.
This game is like most modern games,its ok but gets boring & repetitive very quickly because there's no reason to care about the protagonist & therefore lil incentive to finish the game. Same problems as KF2 but at least that game had better weapons & level designs.(but it still sucked overall)

Having to press a button every time you pickup ammo without accidentally dropping your gun,completely destroys the gameplay & makes the enemies not be a nonstop horde coming at you since the game has to let you time to pick up ammo in between enemies (which sucks) this should've had way more enemies coming at you all at once with auto ammo pickups."
cant sex samuel hayden
Doom (2016) more like Do-zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
:/
Doom 2016 has been surpassed in every way by its sequel Doom Eternal. Don't waste your time and efforts on the mechanically inferior gameplay and nonexistent story material.
I should have known given Bethesda's reputation but I decided to give them a try. The bugged achievements and crashes are game breaking enough for me to regret buying. A shame....
"Fun for a little while but overall its a bit too easy and stale, b-hopping and shotgunning a million of the same enemy becomes boring very quickly"
"replaying in 2022 id put this game in the ""allright"" section. not shit. not that great anymore. it's just that different soundtrack that got it so busted for the time it was released."
"[b]Short version:[/b] 5/10 game.   

[b]Long version:[/b] Alright so, I am an old gamer who played the original Doom when it came out, then Doom II when it came out.  LOVED those games, which really set the mark for First Person Shooters from that point.  While I played plenty of games in the decades since, I had gotten away from most FPSs by the mid 2000s.  Doom 2016 was a return to the series after 30 years.  

Doom 2016 certainly does a good job of modernising the hell demons, the UAC and adding depth and realism to the story, which was almost non-existent in the original games.  The layout and feel of the levels was good as was the linear type pacing.  

Where it lost a huge amount of the original games' charm was in execution of game play.   In the original games, I would describe them as moderately challenging - enough challenge that you need to pay attention, but not so much as to frustrate you.  The main appeal of the originals was to be this over-powered space-marine (now known as the Slayer) running through levels blasting everything that moved.  It was crazy fun to go flying through those levels, guns blazing, laying waste to demons in your wake. 

In Doom 2016, you feel a heck of a lot less powerful and capable compared to the originals.  It feels far less like you're a ""Slayer"" and more like it's a fair fight.   The weapons, to me, seemed to be about one third as powerful as they were in the original games.   Thinking I was probably remembering the originals through an inflated sense of nostalgia, I installed them again, and tried them.  Sure enough, the weapons are [i]far[/i] more powerful in the old games. 

I don't know if this was a way to try and make it more ""challenging"" for people who want that sort of thing in a game, or if there was another reason behind it.  To me, this breaks the fun of the game by making it a chore instead of a gleeful pleasure.   I play games to have [i]fun[/i], not to frustrate and challenge myself - I have real life for that.  The original games were fun, this game teeters between fun and chore.  On the easiest setting, the game is 50/50 fun/chore, and gets worse the more you notch up the difficulty.

Sure, like any game, you can get better and better at it the more you play, reducing the difficulty over time - but again, that's only enjoyable if it's fun to do.   Disappointing that after all these decades they have seemingly lost the point of the game."
cant sex the imps :(
"Some might say that the game was revolutionary in 2016 and rating it based on a 2024 experience wouldn't be fair to the game, but I am convinced that it suffers from major flaws to its design that manifest regardless of when it was made. The game's fast-paced action conflicts with a maze-like map design that encourages slow exploration. Half the time you will be looking for secrets through boring, repetitive levels rather than actually fighting, or doing annoying challenges that interrupt the action. While all this is optional, you will of course be underpowered if you don't partake. The actual fighting feels largely pointless due to the lack of an interesting story to draw you in, with a silent protagonist and the most generic villains imaginable. None of this makes it a bad game, but it does make it struggle to stand out or retain the player's interest.

This is not me just disliking shooters, because there are plenty that I absolutely love. I'm just convinced the game is massively overhyped. I can't speak for the multiplayer, but it's hard to recommend the singleplayer unless you love trying to platform in dark and repetitive areas while doing the same kill animation each time and having to juggle 6 guns because each one runs out of ammo in a few seconds."
"Skip this one. Play Doom Eternal instead.  This game suffers from horrible map design and the most frustratingly unclear quest objectives.  Platforming, which is a huge part of the game, is slippery and has massive penalties making for an incredibly frustrating experience.  

This game was a good reboot, but it is inferior to its sequel in every single way."
Overated as hell
Cant sex the Doomslayer :(
"Play Ultrakill, much better"
Too aggressive
"Don't even bother with this game, just play the classic DOOM games and don't give Bethesda any money."
boring
This game is scawy :((
"worse than doom eternal, refundig this game."
meh.
"Boring and monotonous. All you do is walk into a box, shoot all the enemies in the same way with the same guns, walk into a hallway, go into another box, and repeat. If a game is supposed to be 30 seconds of fun repeated indefinitely, this game skipped the 'repeated indefintely' part and is only fun for the first 30 seconds. Goring demons can be somewhat cathartic, but the novelty wears off very quickly."
"Horrible framerate issues, is locked to 30 fps even when i switch to vulkan, freezes when i try to play, Bethesda moment :/"
"I need easier than ""I'm Too Young To Die"" mode.  I run around... and die.  I step in the wrong place... and die.  I don't move... and die.  I take a breath... and die.  If I play a little longer I'll find more ways... to die.  Not very rewarding."
"I am just so, so, so done with games that do not respect your time enough to let you do any sort of manual save.  Just lost a solid 15 minutes of gameplay IN A DOOM GAME for being unable to figure out where to go in a level and never encountering anything that saved my game before managing to fall into lava.  Eat shit."
"Not what I was hoping for, absolutely no fun, no tension factor, enemies are simply modeled, difficulty level is high because you hardly have any health packs or ammunition, no save... poor. I'd rather stick to classic Doom and its mods, it's more fun."
"Typical generic doom with a ridiculous difficulty spike on a particular 2nd stage boss fight towards the end. Your average we couldn't get creative so we made a bullet sponge who can kill you in 2 hits fare. Trash can POS game with next to no story. I mean yeah its doom. If ya like doom, go for it. I do, but I need lube for a boss like that."
"not a sequel to doom the video game, but doom the comic book. 

the labyrinthine levels and scrolling-shooter combat of the original two games are gone, replaced with a series of boxes where Combat happens, connected via hallways. the entire combat system is designed around having a ""rip & tear"" button, a reference to a one-off Marvel promotional comic written and published four years after Doom's shareware release, with no involvement from the original creators. the end result is not ""doom, but better!,"" but ""Serious Sam with okay combat."" of course, even that only happens after you complete enough of the eight types of upgrade tree (""weapon mods,"" ""weapon mod upgrade tokens,"" ""praetor tokens,"" ""argent cores,"" ""runes,"" ""kill x of y using z"" style upgrade challenges for all of these). this sort of unlock system was always the worst part of devil may cry, god hand, god of war, etc, and this game goes even harder with it than any of them.

there is no level design here, only setdressing. secrets are not actually clever ""secrets,"" but tasks on a list you fill out to make sure you're prepared for the next level. finding most of them comes down to going down the right hallway. (often, the automap will mark them for you, so you don't even need to _try_ to find them). this is *mandatory* because secrets are one of the ways you get those upgrades: if they were actually a challenge to find, it would screw over the casual player. Doom is apparently *about* combat, now, and apparently the only way to get ""progression"" when purely focusing on combat is this type of upgrade system, so interesting level design had to go. most ""combat arenas"" are a big rectangle with some smaller rectangles in it. sometimes they have a second floor of rectangle. sometimes there are teleporters from one end of the rectangle to the other. most fights could happen in the tube from Tempest and the gameplay would not change at all. 

absolutely none of what has kept doom '93 fun, interesting, or Good At All for 30 years is in here. a travesty; and Eternal doubles down on all of it. just get the original(+quake 1) and play some fan levels instead.

played on ultraviolence."
"The navigation in this game is horrid. I constantly lost my way and wandered off into environmental dangers, it's a hellish messy maze. The navigational map is absolutely ridiculous, I don't know who designed it but I want to punch them in the face for how useless it is. They could have at least showed the outline of the level on it so that I'm not confused whether I can reach something or not, but no, it just shows this pathetic blue/gray floor and says ""off you go mate""."
you using Berserk in church????!!!! youre a menace🤣🤣
"NO BUT YES
I'm more of a fan of story based games. I looked at this game and it looked really fun. it looked like a story based game. it isn't. i think that doom could be an amazing story based game for sure. 

I do recommend this game to people who enjoy first person shooters. HOWEVER! this game does get very repetitive... it is honestly just not fun to play after about 20 mins.  i can understand why people would like this but i cant get behind it.

I want to like this game so so bad but as i said before, i prefer story based games. if someone can find me a game that has the same theme as doom but is a story game that would be very helpful!"
"From previously playing it on the playstation and from years of reviews I really expected to come back to this game and enjoy it, but I found the level design very frustrating. It's hard to enjoy a mindless shooter when you somehow can't find a keycard in 45 minutes with gamefaqs open. It's got good music! Though the company has since fucked over the musician who made it."
Terrible FPS in menus that I experienced years ago. FPS caps in certain cutscenes.. wtf. Unless its on sell I don't recommend.
"Since the very first Doom to date is no major FPS that I didn't played, and I can say this: if one don't spend six to eight hours a day, trying to master the art of killing demons, even ""I'm too young to die"" is kinda hard."
really bad stuttering issue.

"It's a shooter lacking the soul and charm of the original Doom games. Playing Doom 1 and 2 you can see how opening each door is like opening Pandoras box, you have no idea what awaits you on the other side and if you're really ready for it. You can outplay it by simply being a death machine or by exploring and secrets around the map that let you get the drop on enemies who would have otherwise gotten the drop on you. That's entirely gone from this game, you are a death machine in the lore and so you shall be a death machine in gameplay as well. Walk in a corridor, go to an arena, kill everything that breathes, walk along the next corridor, rinse and repeat. While the gameplay itself is satisfying for a while, I find that the gameplay loop is stale, but all the more power to you if you enjoy it."
"visually- 10.
gameplay- 5
fun- 0

this crap ain't doom.


Map sucks doomballs.
Guaranteed you will get  lost and have zero help reading the 'map'

quit. uninstall."
Play DOOM Eternal.
Game lag every time !!!
:i
"Down-voting because Bethesda Game Studios refuse to give me access to the game. What a horrible company, I pray you never have to deal with their obnoxious and unhelpful support team."
I don't like the modern Doom remakes. Main reason is the awful glory kill mechanic. I really despise it. Yuck.
"All I wanted to do is shoot some demons in the face, but this game had me jumping and running and looking for acess cards to proceed to the next area. 
Overall I found this to be quite silly and boring. Guess I am not 16 anymore."
so overrated
"Its not bad, but just get doom eternal"
"Fuck this game.

It took a fucking HOUR to load.
Had to reboot because it got stuck at 79%

When it finally loaded it had the fucking audacity to run at 15fps.


Why does this fucking loser LUNGE when I melee.
I know what I'm trying to hit, I don't need you lunging past the thing I'm trying to punch.

Fuck this game."
"Mid. If you liked Eternal but didn't play this yet, don't bother. Slower movement, unsatisfying gunplay. On higher difficulties the monsters do massive damage but you don't have the same mobility as in Eternal to justify that.

Glory kill animations are cool though."
"Hello, review reader. This is a review of the game of the iconic DOOM franchise, DOOM 2016.

Yes, I may have played a small amount of time, but I can safely state the disadvantages I have identified in this installment of the DOOM series of games.

1. OPPONENTS THAT BLEND IN WITH THEIR SURROUNDINGS.
Demons merge with the environment, wherever you are, you will find them only when you approach at point-blank range, and that is not a fact.

2. BOREDOM. BORING COMBAT .
Mowing demons extremely boring, of interesting ways to destroy demons only close combat.

3. EXTREMELY WEAK DYNAMISM .
As if you are playing against mad grandparents from the nursing home.

4. IT'S NOT DOOM, DAMN IT. 

SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T SPONSOR THE LAZY PEOPLE AT BETHESDA."
not fun
"It is too fast-paced for me. It looks cool, but I can barely tell what is going on."
"HardLocked in Hayden's office, I presume this is the ending to the game. I can't wait to play where I left off in doom eternal"
"Beautiful graphics, many breath taking level designs.
On the other hand, all this do not compensate the monotonic game after 4-5 levels. The same pattern repeats again. Creativity seems to saturate in ""how to put even more monsters"" to subsequent scenes. If you survive a 20 monster level, hey, we closed the doors and here's another 25 for you... and you can run around like an Idi*t around in a shoot-die-repeat loop.
The intermediate challenges for acquiring skills... Retrying the same crazy run over and over just to memorize where zombies are placed otherwise time is out? By the 10th retry you mechanically execute it like a bash script... and actually, it is exactly just as exciting.  (ok, I admit, not all challenges were made equal, some are real fun)

Again: But It is really beautiful.
I'd say, 3 stars out of 5... It's too bad that choice is either recommend or not. I'd recommend trying the demo and watch some quality streams instead."
NO RECOMMEND
"I remember why I stopped playing MP:

2/5  ★★ 👎
"Never, I repeat, NEVER select ""Restart Mission"". Trust me."
it will not start beacuse of a error
The game is good but the collectibles broke the flow for me.
"Kämpfen macht Spaß und geht immer vorwärts. Waffen und Rüstung upgraden ist auch sehr schön. Mir persönlich macht es aber nur sehr wenig Spaß, die bewusst verwirrend gehaltenen Karten/Missionen immer und immer wieder zu spielen, nur um alle Geheimnisse und Upgrades zu bekommen. Multiplayer gibt es wohl nicht mehr. Guter Shooter, aber nur für Leute die 1.) einen sehr guten Orientierungssinn haben und 2.) BESONDERE Freude daran haben, stundenlang in einer Mission nach allen Geheimnissen zu suchen"
"I've been playing Doom since the very first game of the series. I've loved this series.

But times have changed, and games evolve. So did the Doom series. 

First off I will say that for a 2016 game, even today..this game looks amazing. The environments are nothing short of breathtaking. And watching the movements of each glory kill or watching the enemies move around the level looks amazing.

And this is where i come in and tell you why if you only care about how a game looks then you might want to just youtube this one for free.

Doom has now taken the path of Mortal Kombat. How cool is it when you rip the monster's head off and **** down its neck? Wow! sounds really cool, huh? Just like a Mortal Kombat fatality....so cool to see the insane gore and blood fly everywhere....

...once. Not every time.

Those are the glory kills. And...they really have to go....or at least renamed to what they are: borey kills. I guess it is cool for the first 3 or 4...but then they become so boring and monotonous and disrupt the flow of the game, it is just more fun to ignore they are present. But this is where things backfire: if you don't ""borey kill"" the enemy, they can recover..and then it takes more ammo than it should to drop them.  Glory kills, plus the action together just me in feeling where I didn't even have a brain....I was just shooting and reacting when the glory kill showed up.....like I was becoming one of the zombies. It wasn't a feeling I like with any sort of game to fully turn off my brain.

But there is something this game does that annoys me to no end: it tries too hard on everything. i get it wants to be a hardcore game, but when you get a certain item from a body, the actions shows your character grab it and rip it off, like it is attached with ten gallons of krazy glue. 

Need to flip a lever? Easy, right? jsut turn it lightly to the other side? Instead...he is going to slam it through the wall. 
Need to open a door? Pull the handle? Nope.....he will just rip it off the hinges.
Need to use the elevator? Push the button right? Nah...he is going to pick up a hammer and bash the button in or set a grenade on it and blow it up. 

You may think it sounds awesome...like he is some POed steroided up soldier....but It just gets too ridiculous and actually takes away from the atmosphere. I ended up rolling my eyes more times than I wanted to. 

I guess if you are someone that wants to turn your brain off completely and be a drooling zombie, and obsessed with seeing the same gore over and over again and thinks that is cool...then this might be the game for you. Me....I'd rather go back and play when the Doom series was actually good."
"play this game before doom eternal, or else you will be disappointed"
The inability to save between checkpoints makes this game impossible to enjoy unless you have   an infinite amount of time on your hands.

church doesnt like et cuz demons
"Echenle 5 pesos mas de historia.

Maybe you should pay him, you assholes."
really? 20 bucks for this ancient game.  shouldn't  this be in the GoG retirement home for old games?

"I know I'm going to hell for this (small pun intended)

I always love games featuring heavy rampage with lots of gore so I honestly cannot believe my own self that I'm left with a huge negative impression. And DOOM of all things, it's like something is wrong with me, however I cannot pretend that I had a great time playing this whether or not you loved it, sadly I could't share the same experience.

What I definitely loved about it was the engaging part, a good weapon wheel variety of weapons and satisfying glory kills. Everything else however was ruining my bloodlust mood.

The map looked a bit complex and even though there was this navigational minimap, the path towards the goal never seemed clear enough. Was I supposed to go here or there? Is that object climable? Can I really make that jump? Or good luck having to find those tiny keycards, one of the dozens of dead guys scattered around the map surely has it!

To make matters worse, the game tries to force you to collect bunch of hidden objects. I couldn't care less about that crap but without it, I'd be stripped down of upgrades to my suit and weapons, so thanks to that most of my time was spent scavenging around for unlockables. Oh and imagine my joy when I happen to find a temporary powerup AFTER I've defeated the last wave. The rune trials were good though as there was at least something I can make use of my time which is killing more enemies.

Next were the challenges, like for example perform a specific glory kill that required to you to literally crouch and aim on an ankle (That's what the walkthrough YouTubers showed me) in order to succeed and receive upgrade points. For god’s sake, that was frustrating to the point of being forced to restart checkpoints numerous times. Kill a specific creature of which I already forgotten its name and have to look up. Play a game of demon destruction of which I thought was one of the rune trials and completely screwup the level.

Another dislike I've encountered were the guns. I mentioned the weapon wheel, I've used this mechanic in other games in the past, but this one is the most irritating. While most games basically pause while selecting weapon, Doom goes in slow-motion which is okay, but the fact that it takes almost a second to load the wheel (while it instantly cycles between current and next through scrolling) makes no sense. The weapons itself also make little sense, like why do I need two shotguns for? Gunplay was also below my expectations, the noise of shooting sounds very quiet and the sound is pretty limited, almost as if they're pea shooters, the game only tries disguising that issue with visual impact animations and explosions. Compare the gunplay, mainly the sound with a classic like Unreal Tournament 1999 and you'll see what I mean.

That is why I could not enjoy this game at all. I was hoping for this to be something straightforward and simple like Serious Sam, but instead left enraged with all the tedious requirements the game wanted me to make in order for a full experience and to proceed thorough the campaign. I can see why this game is overall amazing to most people (mainly because it makes you feel like a badass) but as I've stated before, not everyone that loves a good carnage can enjoy DOOM."
Don't waste your time with a cheating game.
Game itself is quite good. But after killing final boss it always crashes- impossible to finish him. Letter E doesn't appear. Therefore it is impossible to complete the game.
dont buy doesnt work on modern gbus
"No multiplayer. Played once, collected all the dollies, and never opened it again. :(
A shame, because the game is not bad, it's just boring as single-player only. It has no replayability."
"The game is probably really good based on what I've played so far... however, whenever I open the game, all my sound cuts out. Not just the game- everything. Only one out of my several start-ups has the sound worked and I had to mess with the sound settings first. A day later and the way I fixed it before no longer works. It seems really fun, but not without any audio whatsoever. If anyone has a solution that would be great, but until then I cannot recommend this game."
screw this game it has so much issues just trying to get it running on my computer (ryzen 5 5600g and rtx 6700xt)  wont launch at all.
fix black screen on launch bugthesda.
"If you really enjoy shooters...idk if I can recommend this to you. This feels like a game I would've loved back in 2013, but ever since it came out I keep going back to try it and I just keep getting so incredibly bored with it. It just feels very generic. If you really enjoy pretty much any good single player shooters right now, this will probably be right up your alley. But for me, it's just not good enough gameplay-wise. Even though that's precisely what everyone lauds it for. It just feels too generic. 

So if you're a little skeptical, don't buy it. I was skeptical, and it turned out I wasted my money unfortunately."
"It's a little too violent for my taste. Besides that, it's pretty okay c:"
"DOOM (the original) is one of the most influential games of all time. Poured out a ton of sequels. But I personally can't get into the series. I've tried multiple times. I also can't go without saying that I respect the DOOM franchise a ton for what it has done for the FPS genre. Cool series, but just not for me."
"Hela familjen min spelar detta varje lördag klockan 19:39 efter vi käkat tacos med gurka, tomat, sallad, bröd, ost, ostsås, guacamole, salsa och lök. Min kusin och jag brukar spela detta tillsammans men det brukar typ spåra och det slutar alltid likadant.... vad är det jag gör med mitt liv? är det inte typ olagligt att ha sex med sin kusin? hhjälp mig snälla vad är mitt problem. mitt liv går ner i en spiral och jag kan inte hitta vägen upp.. har inga vänner, min familj hatar mig, min kusin har lämnat mig, dottern är död, allt går bara skit asså. snart så är det över...

+ sket bra grafaik spel med bja grafek

- den där kusin situationen"
the game is overall really fun but its getting a thumbs down due to crashing and corrupting my 15 hour save file which i can no longer access; seems this isnt a rare problem for others as well
"Keeps crashing, Foundry level made me quit this game entirely."
Too bad. Doesn't launch. Some Steam application error
Please release Wolfenstein 2009 and Wolfenstein RPG on PC! Or I'll downvote every Bethesda games!
"Just crashes all the time.. Can't play for more than 10 minutes at a time, if I am lucky.
Shame as it is a good game.  Other have the same issue."
Keeps crashing overall good but yeah...
"Bog standard, clunky, frustrating shooter. 
You get caught on random stairs.
The jumps just don't work sometimes. 
Takes forever to load, even on good hardware. 
Its atmospheric, sure, but but its also unreliable.

Wish I could refund it."
Feels more like a generic console shooter than a doom game.
"I hate to give this a negative review as it does so much right- looks great, runs great, sounds great and has great gunplay, but after 8 hours of play I decided then and there to uninstall it and will not play it again.

Why? Simple answer, the level design - it is overly complicated, convoluted and you WILL become lost/stuck not knowing how to continue and having no more enemies to shoot, then spending the next goodness knows how long wandering aimlessly about waiting to accidentally stumble across some lever or button hidden behind a container on a platform that you missed in an earlier area. Of course you can do as I did and watch a playthrough for that 'Oh right' moment and on you go again, until you get stuck/lost again. Exhausting, I just wanna shoot demons, not play a platformer!

Such a shame, loved the original Doom, but for me this is not the same. Thank goodness I got it in a sale otherwise it would have been even more frustrating than it already is. If you value your time, this game's gonna piss you off."
"The core gameplay is solid and the graphics are impressive, it runs perfectly on my (neither new nor expensive) laptop, but it gets very repetitive, in terms of both visuals and gameplay. The environments are extremely drab, boring and often cramped and the gameplay really feels like an endless loop. You get to an area/arena, which is locked down because of demonic activity, tons of demons spawn, you kill them and can proceed.

The environments do make a lot of sense, since the game is set on Mars and in hell, but I can't help but feeling that the complete lack of vegetation, normal buildings or any kind of relatable environments or objects make the game difficult to enjoy.

I'd recommend this game to 90% of FPS fans, but if you're like me and are really bothered by the problems that I mentioned, maybe this isn't for you."
"gunplay is bad, audio is muddy and does not give you satisfaction when shooting a shotgun or crushing enemies
looks like overhype"
Just Play Doom Eternal/10
"Doom 2016 honestly feels like a modern game developer watched someone play the original Doom mod Brutal Doom for about five minutes and stuffed those ideas into a modern, boring, poorly designed game.

* Story.  Please stop talking.  Please stop locking me in rooms and going on about whatever the hell this damn game is supposed to be about for way too long.  I kill demons.  I get it.  Point weapon at demon, hit fire, repeat until game done.  This is the actual story of Doom.  Original gave you some back story in the manual and then some explanations of what happened at the end of each episode in a short, funny, well-done text screen (and Doom II/Final added some mid-game intermission text screens that are just as concise and fun), but those were easily read and skipped.  This?  You have to sit through boring, worthless explanations of whatever the hell is going on in this game for forever.  Something about hell and demons and blah blah let me get back to the actual game.  What a concept.
* ""Lockdown"" rooms.  Oh no.  Just no.  Original gave me freedom to go where I wanted, when I wanted.  If a room started filling with enemies, I could run all the way back to the beginning of the level if I wanted.  It gave me time and space to fight things on my own terms, or if I felt I could handle it, rip and tear right there.  This lockdown garbage is just an excuse to make the game feel more ""dramatic"" and stuff an area with tons of poorly designed, cheap enemies to pad the play time thanks to cheap, stupid deaths.
* Upgrades.  What?  Original Doom, you had one upgrade: the backpack to carry more ammo.  Now you get weapons, abilities, and permanent health/armor upgrades just to survive the incredibly cheap enemies down the road?  How about making the game actually balanced from the start?  Or is that too much of a challenge for modern game designers?
* Cheap enemies. Filling the game with a bunch of poorly designed enemies that are, again, designed to pad the run time thanks to you continually dying to their cheap, insane attacks, is not a good way to design a damn game.  Early enemies that can basically cut your health down with one hit from their energy weapons?  Demons (""Pinkies"" -- ugh) that do an unreliable charge at you and take a billion hits from the front for... no good reason?  An insanely annoying teleporting pile of crap with a wave attack that does insane damage?  An enemy that throws poison goop at you from a mile away?  A freaking boss that has a shield on 99.9% of the time?  Come on.  Admit this was just to keep people from easily flying through the game and not an actual design decision.
* ""Glory kills"" and chainsaws and a dance of health and ammo.  In the original, health and ammo were a resource that you found, conserved, managed, and dealt with while battling the hordes from Hell.  In 2016, there's some health and ammo here and there, but they do little good if you're stuck in a lockdown room and they're several rooms back, unlike the original.  Health and ammo's primary source is instead from the stupid ""glory kills"" inspired by the hackish, silly ""Brutal Doom"" mod for the original game.  These shower you with health and a few bits of ammo while you're taking massive damage from multiple, cheap sources, making keeping up your health not a matter of conservation and resource management, but a bizarre dance of watching your health bar waltz up and down for the entire game.  Worse is the ammo, which you get embarrassingly little of from glory kills.  This instead comes from chainsaw kills, as if somehow chainsaws tap into a different repository of items stuffed inside every enemy than the repository of health and a few bits of ammo you find from punching them, which is just ridiculous all around.  But of course, we can't have the chainsaw work like it used to; it's now an instakill on lower-health enemies that does the showering of ammo upon you, but compensated by the fact that you have to refill it or it runs out of ""ammo"" (gas) after using it a few times. Come on.  Seriously?  Let me use my freaking chainsaw strategically to actually conserve ammo, not to mind-numbingly generate it every once in a while.
* Jumping.  Uuuuggggggghhhhh.  It's the end of freaking Half-Life all over again.  Platforms everywhere.  Gaps that have to be traversed.  Constantly searching for some ledge above you that isn't at all apparent until you actually look all around from multiple positions and angles.  And then it gets worse by adding a double jump, making the game into a blood-filled, violent version of Super Mario Bros.  with its insane jumps you have to make while not even having decent depth perception due to 3d graphics projected onto a 2d screen.  (And don't tell me to play the VR version.  VR is a laughable pile of garbage that needs to die, right now.)  It's ridiculous, it's bad gameplay, it's frustrating, and it's not a good mechanic.  Never has been.  Doom's protagonist doesn't jump.  He might let his mighty insane momentum propel him over small gaps, but this isn't jumping; this is falling, with style.
* Graphics.  I am amazed how many people these days cannot tolerate the original game's graphics when they are absolutely, 100% better than 2016's graphics.  ""How can you say this,"" you ask.  Because the new game's graphics are muddy, indistinct, full of distracting lighting effects, distorted to make everything on screen look nearly the same, covered in fog, and is designed to be as absolutely distracting and detrimental to the gameplay as humanly possible.  So many times I have had difficulty just figuring out what something was because the graphics were so unbelievably overdone that it all just melts into a sameness where you can't tell one thing from the other.
* ""The Doom Slayer"".  No.  No.  NO.  I cannot understand how this stupid name was thought up by the people who made this game, but it fundamentally misunderstands who the protagonist of Doom is.  He is Doomguy.  He does not slay the Doom;  he is the Doom.  He is the Doom of the demons.  The Doom of Hell.  

Go buy the Classic Doom collection on Steam.  Play it.  A lot.  It even has a modern engine for it now and the ability to play Final Doom through an add-on for Doom II.  Please understand and appreciate the precise, well-done, thoughtful design decisions for the classic games and how they put gameplay on a high, golden pedestal and never, ever betray the gameplay for some cheesy, garbage gimmick, which Doom 2016 is absolutely stuffed to the gills with.  Take a good amount of time appreciating the original and I honestly think you'll understand every single point I've made about 2016.

*NOTE: I have a previous full playthrough of this game from another platform and am also applying it to the Steam PC version which I have played enough through to verify the same issues.*"
"Doom is a good game. However, I cannot recommend the steam version. There are many bugs that make the game frustrating to play. The most common bug that I experience is the audio bug. Anytime I open the game, change menus in the menu screen, load a mission, die, load a rune trial, exit a rune trial, or exit a mission, all audio on my computer does not work. I found a small fix to this. If I disconnect and reconnect my headphones on bluetooth, it gets audio back. I have all my drivers updated and this only happens with this game. This was tolerable for the first few missions, but after about 10 hours of gameplay, it has become very frustrating to do this everytime I die or load a mission or open the game. Another bug is one where I cannot fire or switch guns after I throw a grenade. I found a fix to this online where you press shift+tab + esc x2. However my fix: don't throw grenades. It's a simple fix but still annoying and makes the game feel unpolished. Another bug I encounter is sometimes when I upgrade my doom suit with praetor tokens, the game stops working and shows a bunch of code on the screen that I don't understand and so I have to close the game and lose my progress for that section. It is very frustrating especially after I just did a rune trial I had trouble with and then it crashed after I tried to upgrade my suit and I reopened the game and the rune trial was marked uncomplete. I do not encounter many bugs on all my other games, and this only happens on the steam version. This is a good game, but with the amount of times I encounter a frustrating or game breaking bug per session (like 5) I can't recommend this to other people."
Errorrr on my roh ally
Crashes every hour or so and got my 7 hour game save corrupted by one of these crashes. The game needs fixed but at this point I doubt they will fix a 9 year old game
"It's a primitive peace of repetitive trash with low quality content.
The whole gameplay is just walking from one room to another and killing same enemies until they stop respawning in that room."
"Meh There's so much playtime inflation on the beginning, I already know I wont enjoy this."
Multiplayer sucks. Weapons that have 2 seconds delay on firing and enemies with over 200hp everytime. Also no anti-cheat and team-balancing.
Shorter from the old good game plus has terrible map system
takes forever to load zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Garbage
"Honestly, it's extremely repetitive. Glory kills seem awesome until you see the same animation 100 times. The game wasn't too difficult either. Sure I only played it on ""Hurt me plenty"" but I shouldn't have to put the game on the hardest difficulty where it artificially makes it harder by increasing numbers to just to make it more challenging."
"Not recommended. Great graphics and gameplay, BUT id Software has a profound disrespect for the available free time of its gamers. The game is ludicrously difficult, even on easy settings. I gave up and played it on God settings in dev mode after losing far too many times in row. It also becomes the equivalent of Super Mario Bros with a shotgun for much of the game, jumping around from one platform to the next, and falling to your death more often than not. This is supposed to be Doom, not parkour!!!! The majority of your time playing Doom will be spent running around incessantly lost, simply trying to figure out how to get to the next checkpoint and level, then getting killed, and starting over at a checkpoint again. The developers put almost no hints or obvious clues that would help gamers move along quickly throughout the game, so you spend nearly all of your time lost in space, retracing your old steps to find something that must have been missed previously. Even online walkthroughs aren't very helpful, because all the levels are a confusing mess that look nearly identical everywhere you go. Doom has always been a great franchise through the years, but they really dropped the ball on this one unfortunately. If you value your free time, and are a casual stress-free gamer, avoid this one completely...."
Toggle crouch? Baby game.
satanic images
it fails to load 60% of the time
"this game is afwul, how it got overwhelmingly positive reviews is beyond me. people who like patrick bateman sigma grindset 100 ohio will love this game though. chuds."
It was fun for about the first 6 hours. Then it became the most self indulgent wash rinse and repeat shooter game I have ever played. its like they just ran out of ideas half way through.  Super glad I got this on sale for $5
was too hard whilst playing and it hurt alot while was tearing through demons :(
"Buggy as hell.....played like 15 hours in a new slot and then the ""file was corrupt"" and I had to delete.... I was just trying to go back and remember some old times....guess not junior!!! POS!!!!!!"
don't buy this unless you want to lose your progress every single time the game crashes...
"If you want to play a doom game, go for eternal. It's a lot more enjoyable. This one felt a bit more sluggish, no dash in this one. The environment is also way cooler in eternal and the loot design is more loyal to OG doom."
"Honestly, this game is a major disappointment. The level design is very lack luster and boring. Platforming is fluid and cool at times, but it doesn't really fit the classic Doom level design. Classic Doom and Doom II have a far more gritty atmosphere. In this game the colors feel way too over saturated. The guns in Doom 2016 feel way worse than even the classic games, almost like I'm playing Halo (no recoil or feeling of power behind firing the gun). I played on the hardest unlocked difficulty, Ultra-Violence, and it felt like I was playing the game on recruit difficulty. The Ai enemies are way too easy to kill. Maybe on Nightmare difficulty things would be a bit more challenging, but the base difficulties are just too ez. Just shoot an enemy until they glow, and perform an insta-kill on them. Rinse and repeat. Honestly, just pick up Classic Doom and Doom 2 and install the brutality mod for those. It is a wayyyy better experience. Guns sound and feel better, and the level design is great. Plus the modding community is amazing. Less $$$ as well. I really wish I could like this game, but it just falls short in comparison to the classic games with the brutality mods installed."
"Pretty fun game ,however 
You can't save the game whenever you want"
"Spent several hours trying to get this game to work properly but couldn't get it to work on my pc (which runs several more recent / more demanding games).  Appreciate this may be just my set up but thought I'd share in case others have the same issue.  And then couldn't get a refund as I'd spent too long trying to get the game to work, despite never actually being able to get to anywhere apart from the load screen!"
"I love the combat and gun play, fantastic, top notch. The levels and enemy design are visually interesting. It's great to see enemies from my childhood realized in today's modern graphics. Unfortunately the story is not interesting, it just serves to string levels together and I found it impossible to get invested in anything going on. Also Doomguy is frustratingly slow, so zooming around the fight arenas the way I want is not possible. The game requires you to complete finisher moves to gather health and ammo, which is fun, however you are vulnerable to attack while the Doomguy slowly goes through the finisher animation.

The music is excellent, battling enemies while jamming to the sound track never gets old. I love the difficulty, but the game's checkpoint system is abysmal. You just spent an hour refining your skills to complete a Gore Nest  or Rune challenge on Nightmare, you finally win, you are thrilled, and then you die for whatever reason and the game resets you back so far you have to do the entire fight again. There was no reason to remove manual saves from this series, and I can't respect a game that doesn't respect my time and effort. Ultimately, I had a great time fighting through this game but would only recommend on discount."
Why are you looking for negative reviews for this game? Go download it now.
died at least 7 trillion times to double jump failing. not recommended.
"This game is incredibly unstable, and is in need of some support from the devs. I think the game crashed a minimum of 10 times in a mere 78 minutes of playtime. Steam says 83 minutes because the last crash it took five minutes for steam to finally close the game!
Latest drivers for everything, nothing helped this dumpster fire. Refunding right after this. Doesn't matter if it was cheap during Steam summer sale, it still needs to work as intended."
"Should be called ""black screen simulator""."
"Is there anything so wrong with this game? Not really, but I thumb-downed it, because after a few hours of playing, I lost interest.

Edit for second attempt: Yeah, I was right the first time. Kind of gets boring after a while, but it IS some mindless fun."
meh
"This game honestly felt lackluster, yes it has badass battle scenes but i guess its just my itch of movement shooters not being scratched since the movement is a slow and airstrafing even with the rune is not that much of a difference. The story was mid honestly, though i doubt people actually care about the story. Plus the game became like a chore when the enemies got harder, dont get me wrong i love a hard battle, but the shots i shot didnt feel like they were satisfying. For example in a souls game however gave you the feeling of actually hitting something. Overall this game did not met my expectations. Lets hope doom eternal can change my opinion on this game."
I don't understand why people like the gore. this is awful
Boring and Repetitive
"First off the positives. The soundtrack is awesome, the graphics are very nice and the game runs like butter on a lot of hardware. I'm pulling 200+ FPS on ultra 1440p. The action is quick and you have plenty of ammo recharges to basically just unload. Everything on paper sounds good.

I'm not sure what my exact issue is with the game, but it feels far too fluid. No action has any resistance. What I mean by that is a shot from your shotgun or pistol feels the same. Punching and ripping an enemy in half offers no slow down and you just unload on the demons and fly through levels. It just has a weird flow and feel to me. It's hard to put it into words, it just feels like you're gliding through water. I don't dislike the game, but it just doesn't hit in the same way another FPS might."
"I just can't get into it. It either annoys me, bores me, or I get lost and can't figure out where to go."
"Great game, but bugged challenge achievement prevents 100%"
"idk it just feels so sluggish and tedious. if you're going to make an FPS with an emphasis on constant movement, why make the player so slow? why lock the jump trajectory and not even deign to give us airstrafing? why lock the rune that gives you mobility in mid-air to about a third of the way through the game?

i know the difficulty curve in this game is kinda infamous at this point but the fact it locks your difficulty option in for the playthrough means you can't even do much about it. getting your ass kicked at the start because you only have two weapons and no mobility options, and you DARED to pick nightmare? lmao skill issue. think the game got way too easy by the end and you started out on hurt me plenty? have fun with the literal cakewalk you now have. at least in retro doom UV was basically hurt me plenty with a few more guys

glory kills are great but something about them feels off in this game, at least compared to eternal

actually, i think a lot of these issues came about after i played through eternal and realized how much it made this obsolete in comparison"
lame AHH game.
"incredibly overrated, when the movement game has dogshit movement (you cant strafe mid air)"
"Can,t see anything its to dark, ridiculous"
The guns feel weak and doomguy is way too slow
"Okay but severely overrated.  Seems to hang onto the need to ""feel like Doom"" so much that it limits itself as much as it succeeds.  Get it on sale if you want a whole bunch of repetitive rip-and-tear for $5 or so.


The Good:
Combat is fast, violent, and over the top, as it should be.  Weapons are decently fun at worst and higher tier ones are extremely satisfying (weapon attachments expand this even more), and the game does a great job of making you switch between nearly all of them in later fights (at least on Ultra Violence).

Glory kills and the chainsaw are great mechanics to keep health/armor/ammo from drying up without spoonfeeding the player.  They might be the best thing about Doom. 


The Bad:
Design/environments lack variety.  I was happy to see the outside of an ice-covered base at one point, but was quickly sent inside to wander through *even more* dull chrome hallways filled with gore.  I hope you like gray and orange.

Combat gets samey really fast and never recovers.  Every big room spawns a bunch of enemies, and it's typically the same general variety of them (except with more waves and increasing numbers of the harder demons as the game goes on).  It's a shame that combat this fundamentally good can become boring, but it somehow manages to.

There are only three boss fights, and all of them take place in flat, featureless arenas.  Like every other enemy, the trick to fighting them is to dodge projectiles and shoot them a whole bunch until they're dead.  Fine, I guess, but felt like a wasted opportunity to do something more.

Exploration/secret-finding, despite being a pillar of the game, is slow and uninteresting, and often involves just wandering around until you find an open vent or a big out-of-place lever on the ground.  Coupled with the frenetic combat, it makes the game's pace feel horrible - a constant lurch back and forth between violence and tedium.

Worse, some secrets (shown nearby on the map, with in-game upgrades) can't be collected until you complete more of the level - except that some levels prevent backtracking (doors lock behind you, etc.), so if you make a bad guess that progressing the level will give you access to the secret, you have no choice but to restart if you want to get everything.

The plot is unoriginal.  Big soulless corp exploits dangerous thing for power/profit.  Stuff goes wrong!  Ending is short and mYsTerIoUs in a way that just felt lazy.  Looking back, it's sad to say that the first 1-2 minutes of the game are probably the most interesting part."
"Unskippable cutscene, no manual save, big ass confusing map, unbalance Ultra-Violence difficulty. I mean, previous Ultra-Violence Doom games is hard and challenging but still playable, not this one. This one is just pain in the ass. Doom 3 is way better."
Games too fuckin' big.
can't cap fps and so runs ... too well? it's seemingly breaking the game I'm not sure what I have to do to make it playable.           Will gladly recommend if i can find fix.
doom eternal is better
"Retarded game with stupid checkpoints, bugs, monsters spawn inside you, no dmg feedback, retarded weapon system that force you to use your keyboard like piano"
"An over-saturated mess.

This just seemed like one multiplayer arena after another linked together by some tunnels and elevators with some uninteresting tale weaved throughout it all. Long gone are the days of action/adventure, problem solving I guess. After about half way though this, I couldn't wait for it to be over. How far Doom has fallen from the original recipe."
I didn't like the pistol (i like games based how much i like the pistol)
"for the $5 i spent, fun but unremarkable. fps's that do the same thing as a thousand other fps's shouldn't get the 9.5's out of ten this game got all over the place. those ratings should be reserved for games that innovate in a significant way. games that feel different and new and leave a lasting memory deserve 9.5. this game doesn't do that. nothing specifically wrong with this game. doom is what it is, but that warrants an 8.0, not a 9.5. so a down-thumb from me to counteract the rating inflation. (if you haven't noticed i have a chip on my shoulder about the lack of innovation in the fps genre especially after seeing the few games that tried to innovate and had enormous success... e.g. bioshock, dishonored, alien: isolation)."
"Very repetitive even at 1 hour. Glory kills? Meh. Monsters keep sound 'whaaah' in your headphones, its annoying at best. 

Gameplay is standard FPS, run and gun. You don't even need to aim bro, there is a shotgun with plenty of ammo. Infinite ammo on your pistol.

No strategy required - run and gun. Did I mention the 'whaahhh' sounds in your headphone. Story? Meh. Innovative gameplay maybe? Ofcourse not. 

I would have refunded this if I was eligible."
"So the game is good. I just wish it didn't become impossible to play. Like I got to the 11th level boss of 13 levels. And that is ridiculous.... I played on the easiest setting. I always do. I don't care. I paid for the games I just want to have some fun and move on. Not redo a level over and over. Anyway at that point the game becomes not fun to play. If they just made easy beatable (Like most other games). It would be fine.

So then I did God Mode to beat the boss and it flags your save file. So you don't get achievements or anything. It's not even fun at the point you start using cheats anyway. But even on God Mode the boss is annoying to beat. It just wasn't fun anymore. So never played level 12 and 13. For that is why I can't give it 5 stars. It's like 3 to me. I wouldn't even recommend it. It's not playable for me."
In 4 hours i softlocked my game 3 times
"As someone who isn't a fan of shooters, this game serves as a reminder of why I steer clear of the genre. I don't mind brutal violence and killing daemons with a chainsaw (though that was surprisingly fun for the first few times). However, the dullness and monotony reached unparalleled levels, leaving me questioning my life choices and longing for a more exciting experience, like organizing my sock drawer."
"So much hype around this game, I expected Doom and it had some cool stuff every now and then, but fights are crap, most guns don't feel powerful, I see myself killing too many enemies in melee, and more than half the time is spent looking for those USBs to gain upgrades.

I hope Eternal is better."
"One of the most overhyped games of all time. Combat is dull and clunky, the games story is uninteresting and it's very buggy. No clue if i missed some joke or something but i just don't like it."
"I was going to replay this game, but then I remembered how bad it was."
There is no option for hold crouch its toggle crouch only
"Decent game. Good music. A little disappointing though. Maybe I'm a little late to hop on the hype train, but it felt really short, and playing this after playing ULTRAKILL makes this game feel slow, dry, and with a shallow combat. Not worth the 20$, but I'd still recommend if on sale."
"The campaign takes you from interiors where everything has gone to hell, to the hellish landscapes of mars, to hell. Its just red all the time. The levels are largely the same. Halfway through you've seen all the enemy's, and the gameplay consists of rip n tear your way down a hallway or rip n tear until a room is empty. There's no variation. No we're in this kind of place so there's going to be a particular enemy you'll see a lot of. No the landscape here is different so there's all these different obstacles and opportunities. An encounter could be transplanted from a shrine on hell to a science lab and you wouldn't know the difference.

Its a competent game, well balanced, good soundtrack, pretty graphics, barely any glitches that I found, but it's so repetitive like that one guy that just talks about how wasted he got last night."
this game sucks
"I guess I'm in the minority on this one, but I hated this game. I beat it, and it was the video game equivalent of being forced to eat a bowl of canned green beans. I love classic Doom, but - to steal a joke from someone - this is like one of those Taco Bells they renovate and make to look like a bank. 

- Most of the levels are corridors filled with the weaker mobs that you can just headshot with a pistol. Possibly the only good use of the pistol for the rest of the game. 
- The corridors inevitably lead to an arena-style area that you clear out the riff raff and then begin by pressing E on some object. These arenas are just basically the entirety of the rest of the game. They are chaotic and you are just running around double jumping and shooting while everything dogpiles on you. 
- Armor is like PAPER thin. Just like a few hits and it's GONE. Kind of seems worthless at a certain point. 
- A core mechanic is pressing F on flashing enemies when they get close to death. This starts a melee animation that results in them dropping a pittance of health and/or ammo. So you're in this chaotic battle intermittently watching these dumb melee animations - which by the way the other mobs can move around freely while you're in the animations - and you are dumped back in control afterwards and sometimes it's in a disadvantageous position. 
- I frequently lost entire battles to a single remaining shield guy. Like seriously, Hell should just invest in more shield guys, that could have won them the whole ass game. 
- The other only problematic mob is the charging bull style creatures that will just annihilate your armor if they hit you. 
- I couldn't really understand the main NPC that provides story cues. Like they went with the deep voice thing and I was just like ""huh?"" most of the time. 
- The whole game is too dark. Not like thematically dark, I understand it's hell etc. but like literally I couldn't see mobs or just was confused jumping around the arenas sometimes. 
- I don't think DOOM is supposed to feel like Unreal Tournament? Like the old school ones you couldn't even jump and 3 was like survival horror. 
- The sets were not really memorable. I think something that made the original DOOM games was the sets and they just didn't put much originality into this. 
- I think a lot of people love the music and like don't get me wrong I like rock/metal but this is laughably repetitive and generic. 

If you get this game on sale for like $3 it's probably ""worth"" it, but I hated playing this and I couldn't recommend or leave a positive review."
multiplayer achievements
"boring, TWO  THUMBS DOWN!"
"By all rights Doom is a great game. It looks good, sounds good, and the gunplay feels good. So why am I not recommending it...?

Because you will spend more than twice as long backtracking over the empty map, than you will actually fighting anything in it.

The gameplay is fun and frenetic bullrushing, BUT if you want to level your character, you have to explore the maps with the fine comb for the collectables. No, not for achievements sake - I mean literally your character level (and power) is tied to finding upgrades hidden in vents or up cliffs. If you don't want to feel yourself getting weaker as your progress, then you're committed to doubling back and searching every cranny of the map. Or looking up a guide for the map.

BONUS: sometimes during a mission, you can't backtrack to one. Maybe a drop, or a door that locks behind you. Do you feel like playing the entire mission all over from the beginning for that single upgrade? I sure as hell do not.

A fantastic gameplay design otherwise, but I'm not going to play a game that can't make up its mind how it wants to be played."
boring
Game gets very repetitive after a few hours
"I owned this product and now i do not. I do not understand. I do not like this. 

For why did my program get taken away?"
"PLEASE DOOM DONT MAKE STUPID PUZZLES ALSO THIS GAME IS NOT EVER SCARY BRUH I THOUGHT IT'S SAME AS DYING LIGHT BUT NOO IT GAME LOOKS LIKE MADE FOR +2 yo

I guess all doom series are same as this :/ not a fan of doom"
too expensive but gameplay is kinda good
mid game
lack at gameplay its boring than eternal
"Decided to go back and complete all runes, get all upgrades etc. I decided to restart the final mission - big mistake as all missions I'd replayed at been lost so all runes, weapon upgrades, upgraded runes, the lot gone. Nothing to warn you other than says current mission progress will be lost (of course I wrongly thought this just meant THAT SPECIFIC mission not every rune, secret etc I'd gone back and completed.). I was just about to finally finish the game, now I've just uninstalled it as I've no intention of going back and completing all that again. 

On googling realised that I'm not the only one and there is nothing you can do to get your old game file back."
"DISCLAIMER: 
[i] DOOM [/i] is a good game. If you are interested in this game, I'd give you a 97% chance that you'll like it. Why? just look at any of the tens of thousands of positive reviews. That said, [i] DOOM [/i] does a few things that make the game impossible to enjoy for me, no matter how solid the game is at its core. If you play games like me, if your brain is Autism-addled like mine and ''optional'' challenges and secrets feel as though they are mandatory, then read this review.

First, let's establish what kind of game [i] DOOM [/i] is. As the store page describes: ''fast, fluid movement provide the foundation for intense, first-person combat.'' Indeed, this game is best enjoyed running around like a maniac, crushing demon skulls, shooting their heads off, and blowing them up. The game's intended experience - what it's crafted around - is to slay demon after demon while you're propelled forward by a killer soundtrack. 

Given this core of frantic action, a problem arises when the game introduces challenges and secrets with every level. Let's start with secrets. These consist of hidden areas that contain either collectibles (not relevant for in-game progress) or meta-upgrade points that allow you to improve various capabilities of your character for the rest of the game. (for example faster animations or more equipment capacity) At the end of each stage, you'll get an overview that indicates what you did and did not find. Without fail, seeing this screen was a stab; a painful reminder of all the stuff I missed. How much stronger I could be, but was not. For the levels that I did, I found about 20% of the useful stuff each time. This left me with two choices: Either I spend 30 minutes after clearing a level scouring the map for its hidden secrets (or, alternatively, use a video guide to find everything), or I attempt to suck it up and tread on, missing many upgrade points in the process. Given what I explained before about this game being a fast-paced adrenaline ride, I hope you can see that the first option is completely antithetical to the game's intended experience. It's just not fun. It's tedious and takes the pace completely out of it. For this reason, I attempted the second option and tried to treat this stuff as optional. This proved to be impossible for me. My brain simply can't handle leaving so much stuff behind while constantly being reminded of it at the end of each level. When I found out at the end of a level that the game even hides the upgrades for improving your core attributes (max health, max armor, max ammo) after missing it, I gave up.

Each level also comes with three combat challenges. These reward you with points for upgrading your weapons. Soon enough the game starts rewarding these to you just for killing demons in each level, so for the sake of your progression these are not so terrible. Unless, that is, you are like me and at the start of each level you decide to check what your challenges are and feel a compulsion to complete them as soon as possible for fear you might miss out if you complete the level before being done with them. What makes these challenges especially terrible is that in trying to achieve them, they change the way you play often in a way that is, again, opposed to the fun way of playing the game. Let me explain by giving a typical example. The first challenge you'll get is to kill two enemies with one shot using the shotgun. Now, If you are like me, you'll painstakingly try to whittle down the enemies' health to the point where they'd die if you so much as point at them. Next, you'll try tediously to group them together so that you can try to finish off two in one shot. After trying a while, you'll succeed. Congratulations! you completed a challenge, there will be thousands more to come. The price you pay for going after these challenges is your enjoyment. Doing them dictates that you play in a way that is not fun, and not doing them (if you're like me) will eat away at you in the back of your mind while you desperately try to push it away.

If you identify with my way of playing games, you should strongly consider against buying [i] DOOM [/i]"
Literally my reaction to that information (I have severe anger issues and homicidal tendencies)
"It has all of the elements of one of the best first person shooters of all time, but it also has some of the most annoying traversals between waypoints I've ever seen. I got lost, tried to use the map, which didn't help because it doesn't tell you where you're supposed to go. I booted it up again today to get the trading cards out of it, and spent twenty minutes just blindly following the waypoint marker, and then getting into fights in tight corridors with bad lighting so I wound up hanging back and picking enemies off one by one, which is exactly the opposite of the game's intended play style.

If it was a bunch of arenas all right next to each other with the occasional secret and platforming challenge, 10/10. Game as exists is more getting lost and squinting at objective markers than actually killing demons, and I'm not even satisfied with the demon fights when I get to them."
"Save the game. Then see ""File is corrupted"" in the game save slot. Great. Start the whole fuck'in game all over again? Crappily made game. They get no more of my money."
"It's boring, I'm bored, I want to progress with fluidity instead of kill all, door doesn't open, go find last enemy, repeat."
Boring ass gameplay
^^ cmon another greedy price hike....
I jus don't be liking it ykwim
"The most boring FPS I have ever experienced. You just kill demons. ""ThAt's JusT wHaT dOoM iS"" No it's not. The first 2 DOOM games as well as 64 had really interesting and inventive level design, puzzles, varies enemy types, and tight gameplay. DOOM 2016 has been nothing but killing the same demons over and over again in nearly exactly the same level layouts."
It's just an inferior Doom Eternal. I tried playing it on Nightmare and I couldn't. I rather prefer to waste my precious GBs on DE than this.
"This game is good, but outdated. Just buy Doom Eternal, it's better in every way"
"i do not recommend this game , because this game doesn't work! 
I bought this to play over the holidays,  (for the mouse and keyboard experience), and all i get is a BLACK SCREEN  when i launch it. 
i don't understand how a PC game works well on my PS4 but doesn't on my pc
Also i looked for a fix ( which no one is suppose to do in the first place) , NOTHING WORKS."
"Game breaking bug at the Close The Well mission that STILL isn't fixed after 7 years. After killing all the demons and destroying all 4 coolers, the way out won't open like it's supposed to and the music keeps playing. This prevents any further progression in the campaign. I tried the workaround where you glitch past the red wall but I couldn't replicate it. Way to ruin a fun playthrough, id.

There's a whole thread about this issue here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/379720/discussions/0/357287304433131370/?ctp=5"
I can't find the exit
"The multiplayer is a f#cking joke, never have enough people to start a single session."
boring game made for low iq drooling bethesda fans.
"Was ok at best. Not really sure about all the hype that was about it. 
Most weapon really have not impact. just shoot till flash, you can then hit ""F"" key and over kill cut scene,"
"no mod support
every day we stray further from DOOM"
mah pc is poopy
weapon wheel doesnt work
"Kinda meh,. really slow didnt want to get through the game cus of how i was give almost nothing and had weapons that did jack all compared to other fps shooters. Also its alot slower than i was initially told."
"Just no.  Absolutely not.  The epitome of dreadful game design

A boring and dreadfully repetitive slogfest where I was playing solely for the sake of completion by 3hrs in.  The monotony is only punctuated by bosses, bosses that are even less fun than the core game-loop.  

Do not even consider buying it - it is worth neither your time nor your money.  Who decided to shower this tripe with awards?"
"It's too slow-paced. I have too much ammo, too many resources to kill demons with, and the spaces are open enough that I can take my time.What do you mean change my difficulty to a higher setting? No."
战斗30秒，找路半小时，游戏节奏像是便秘了十年
"No sound in-game, and I've tried every 'fix' available. At least I only paid a few dollars for it."
"Ya know, I really don't care for this game.

I absolutely loved pre-doom 3 content and this seemed to be trying to make a modern return to form but the formula doesn't work.  Sure, its aesthetically well made.  But the gameplay is stiff and much slower than the original.  The AI is about as intelligent as the original game was 30 years ago but without the well crafted design of that era's weapon kit.  The map flow and interplay is generic and forgettable.  Perhaps worst of all is the way you're *supposed* to play is with constant pauses while you wait for your supposed glory kill to finish.

TLDR: Don't believe the hype."
Apparently this can run on everything except my PC
"This game really isnt worth all the atention, all i can say that its just a run and shoot type game, in the first levels there are only 2-4demon types and they arent even strong. The games story telling is really bad, i dont even know if it really has a story, all the characters say like 10 words per level and the rest is searching for the next level since the game doesnt clearly tell where to go next.

2/10 only buy it if you enjoy shooting without any story and cool stuff"
"I cannot address this review to main game, which is sold here. On my first playthrough, I intentionally installed a mod to increase damage and ammo of all weapons in game, disabling boring GloryKills and other elements of looter shooters. From myself I can only advise to buy the game with at least 50% discount and install Doom (2016) Weapons Mod v.1.2 by Rivarez on it. But it will lose opportunity to get any game achievements, as for its correct work modification activated developer mode. Keep in mind!

As for the game with the previously mentioned mod, Doom feels quite correct, mediocrely thought-out, but no less interesting. Lack of ubiquitous drops of ammo and health kits force player to remember where the necessary resources took the place and in what quantity. This is much closer in spirit to the original Doom II, in which, because of the large number of enemies in locations, it was necessary to actively fight and be wise in choosing weapons, tactics, know where and how much health and ammunition can be replenished. Visually, the game resembles its predecessor - Doom 3. Overall this is last game from id Software, for which I, as a fan of classic shooters, am not ashamed. Don't forget that all of above applies to Doom 2016 with installed Doom (2016) Weapons Mod v.1.2 by Rivarez, which you can download from link below:

https://www.moddb.com/mods/weapons-mod-for-doom-2016

If you're not sure you're ready for this game, you can easily download a stripped-down first level of game as a demo version, should help you decide on choice. In terms of performance and the game's friendliness to low end systems, the demo ran on my average laptop with a graphics card equivalent to a GTX 550ti in performance with mobile processor Core i5-6300U."
Misleading minimum requirements
Unplayable. >20 minute load times.
"actual garbage game, i would throw this in the trash if i had a physical copy"
mechanics so dated feels like 1993 doom
"Movement too slow. Enemies too basic. Combat flow constantly interrupted by the glory kill system. Mandatory combat-less exploration between level sections kills any momentum you might have gained, with further exploration being heavily encouraged in order to get collectibles for a tacked-on upgrade system. Both the music and graphics are better than the actual gameplay, and these fail to carry the game. Even a mod (Black Doom), while somewhat redeeming the slow movement, failed to jazz up the game's barebones formula sufficiently for my tastes. It may advertise itself as a boomer shooter, but it's really just a lame FPS."
"Good from a technical point of view but everything else is bad. The AI of the game is not exploited to its potential. Gameplay dumbed down to cater to kids at lower and medium difficulties and at higher difficulties it come close to fighting high level bots. Poised with scripts. They added secondary fire modes and upgrades which is not Doom. Might be enjoyed by people who love the MP, but overall not a good single player experience."
More repetetive than a clock
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It doesn't save your game, every time I play it, it just says that it's corrupted or lost, so don't buy it, share this with others."
extremely average
"Something about this game.  I only played it for 10 minutes and I absolutely hate it.  It is so boring and uninteresting.  I enjoyed the original Doom and Doom 2.  This game is just so underwhelming.  The enemies take longer to kill than they should.  And there's just so much orange, it's ugly."
go play doom eternal
"I didn't like the level design, the shooting mechanics felt off and I really don't care for repetitive glory kills. Maybe I'm just tired of shooters after 25-odd years of playing them but I finished Titanfall 2 around the same time and enjoyed it."
meh i did enjoy more wolfenstein than this one finished once and not playing this again
too much fucking platforming

hot garbage. video settings are screwy.
"Painfully slow movement.
No aim-down-sights."
Crashes quite a bit.
"Gaming 2 hours, in maze 1 hour."
Shame the game (mp) is full of idiot cheaters. Suppose that's what you get with no anti cheat. Shame as the mp can be a blast until a moron shows up.

i really don't like the balancing of damage in certain parts of the round where you can die instantly with a single blow and in certain time not even with 3 hits which makes it very irritating with the same demon.
"Definitely my type of fast action shoot em up game but I cannot get past the everything red! I've now played maybe 3 hours and am going to uninstall it. You cannot compare this games graphics to the new uncharted, Clyberpunk or even a lot of the older games such as Shadow of Mordor and Metal Gear Solid V. Very disappointed."
Bug oluyor arada. Silah değişimi yapmıyor ve vurmuyor da. Argent D'nur bölümü bug'a girdi. Herkesi öldürdüm ama portal açılmadı (Youtube'dan izledim açılıyor herkesi öldürünce). Bir de düşman çeşitliliği çok az ve yapay zeka tabiki yoktur.
"before I finished it.. I thought ""its an ok game"". but that ending scene really 'ruined' it.. I'll not play it again.. because its just not a fun game (IMHO).. sure the graphics are pretty good.. but a good game is more than just graphics and a bit of gameplay! and there are too many faults..

to start with, it does at least have a better story, with more detail than the original doom (which I played a LOT when it came out).. but the one thing I do despise in these games is being unable to go back through a door that I just came through! and I really dislike having to replay something time and time again because I 'made a mistake'.. e.g. jumped off something that I shouldnt have (or purely miscalculated a jump) or went right instead of left.. or got stuck in some area I cant get out of!! I loathe checkpoint games.. and some of the 'challenges' are just time wasters.. theres no 'challenge'.. its just replaying it time and time again until you get it right.. and the 'secrets'.. what a joke.. some you just walk into.. and others are so ludicrously difficult to find, you could spend literally 100s of hours looking for them (even with the secret finder 'skill')! I personally dont consider that fun.. there are many other issues, hence my 'recommendation'.."
No sex with demons 1/10
"Bad boring game. It's very bad and inappropriate. It has no story and repeats itself every ""mission"". Not fun at all. That doesn't mean I'm bad at the game, I'm actually very good. But it's boring and dumb."
"IT WAS GAME OF THE YEAR. EASY.

now i can't even recommend it. every time i start it up, it decides to rearrange my multi-screen setup. my secondary goes from 3440 to 836x624 because why not. also this is the monitor it starts on. it is NOT the default. if i simply switch to primary again, all settings for that monitor goes to how the game should look, but it leaves a wartorn battlefield everywhere else. oh and it changes the refresh rate as well.

AND NONE OF THIS IS BEING RESET AT EXIT BUT REAPPLIED AT STARTUP

it's fantastic. multiple games are like this. all doom. all bethesda.


tldr; game is great! behaves like a virus
also don't fuck over musicians"
Does not work with blutooth audio. Dreck.
"Not a bad game by any chance, but one with massive flaws I haven't heard a lot of people talk about, so wanted to just write down some thoughts. I would have given it a middle rating if that was possible on Steam.

So first of: the combat of the game is fantastic, as everyone and their mom have already said. It truly does feel like a true modern version of the classic Doom gameplay; running around dodging enemy fire, switching between an array of satisfying weapons on the fly and facing some very cool and well-designed demons. The soundtrack also slaps, mixing Djent and Industrial Metal to make it truly feel like a heavy metal trip through Hell.

HOWEVER; for whatever reason, this is also very retro in a way that doesn't feel like Doom, namely it seems to take a lot of ques from the original Half-Life for whatever reason. Not a bad inspiration necessarily, and the Black Mesa fan game have shown there is a lot of potential in modernizing that sort of gameplay. The problem is they decided to focus on the worst part of that game: awful first person platforming.

The amount of times I fell into a bottomless pit because the double jump didn't trigger, a ledge looked grabable but wasn't, I accidentally slipped off the edge because you run by default, etc. was way too high. This frustration is made even worse by the complete lack of a manual save function, meaning one messed up jump can have you scavenge all that health, ammo and armor all over again from the last checkpoint. I also fell through the ground several times, because Bethesda.

The story moves between ""cheesy intentional camp"" and ""actual boring fanfic writing"". When it is at its best, it knows it doesn't matter and is the stupidest concept ever made, and just exists in the background as a thin justification for fighting demons on Mars. This is a good thing. However it occasionally starts taking itself serious, having unskipable cutscenes and annoying radio dialogues that takes away from the over-the-top fun vibe and makes it feel like a generic sci-fi shooter without any charm or life.

Visually the game is beautiful, depicting Mars and Hell in vivid colors, gory intricate decorations and a lot of creative flair. It does have the same issue as the classic games however where everything within a level kinda looks the same at times, and in some cases its easy walking in circles looking for the way forward, sometimes even stumbling on secret areas thinking it is the real way to progress. Not a big deal, but I think its worth mentioning.

On the modernization side of things, they added a weapon, armor and ability upgrade system which is cool and adds some more permanent rewards for exploring. Most of these systems work pretty well and adds to the core gameplay by allowing your weapons to get even more fun to use, but they have some combat challenges that is needed to fully upgrade weapons that can be really annoying. To upgrade the Super Shotgun, you need to perform 30 double kills with the thing, something that essentially never happens in organic gameplay since it will usually kill the closest enemy instantly, meaning to get it you seem to have to slowly line up enemies and be super careful not to kill them too early. Its just odd, and makes it not worth it with upgrading everything.

All in all, it is a fun game, but a flawed game, and IMO it is nowhere near as good as other retro remakes, such as the new Wolfestein games, the new Prey, and as mentioned Black Mesa. If you're a huge Doom fan and somehow haven't played this yet, go for it. If you are on the edge, I say wait for a sale.

Also, spoiler: the game ends on a really dumb cliffhanger sequel hook, which feels really cheap."

gameplay was too slow and it sucks that you have to get melee kills constantly if you want to survive

"Cannot save other that check points. Almost as annoying that steam's review software, whereby it erases your comments every time you change  yes to no and no to yes."

It saves progress only when passing checkpoints..."

"Sigh. Here we go.

I'm an old-school gamer. My first console was an Atari 2600, and some of my fondest memories are of me and my friends spending hours at the arcade. Growing up, I consumed gaming magazines, blew into cartridges as a means of troubleshooting, and spent far more of my time indoors with a controller in my hand than outside on my bike. My idea of a great weekend was taking turns with my friends playing Wolfenstein 3D on ""I am Death incarnate!"" while wolfing down slices of pizza and cans of Coke and rocking out to Nirvana, Metallica, and Operation Ivy. Over the decades, little has changed. Sure, I'm paying for my own gaming these days, the Coke has been swapped out for beer, and I try to lay off the pizza, but I'd still rather spend my days off on my PC than going out to see a movie or shoot some pool. That should give you some idea of where I'm coming from.

That out of the way, let me say this: DOOM is a great fucking game. Hands down one of the greatest ever made. No, not this piece of hot crap, I mean actual DOOM, with which this game has commonalities only on the surface. Next to Wolf3D, DOOM was my go-to for blood-soaked completionist speedruns on the hardest difficulty. I have a lot of good memories of that game, with the nostalgia dialed up to eleven. I am exactly the kind of person who should love this game. But I don't. In fact, I hate this fucking game- it and its sequel- and I hate them for the same reason I own them: DOOM.

Were this game titled Sinslayer or Hellspace or Coyote Vagina or anything other than DOOM, I wouldn't feel so strongly about it. I wouldn't enjoy it very much- it's not really my cup of beer- but I wouldn't hate it. I'd have played it to its conclusion and passed it off as an okay- if rather repetitive- game, and I wouldn't have given it another thought. The thing that bothers me is that this game calls itself DOOM, and DOOM it most assuredly is not. Sure, it's a FPS with space demons and it's called DOOM, but that's where the similarities end. A lot of people have cited nostalgia as a reason they enjoyed this game, but I'm convinced that none of them ever played the original, because this game feels nothing like it. At all. It feels like someone who once played DOOM thirty years ago described it to someone else, and then that person snorted a line of coke and described it to a third person, and then that person slammed fourteen Monster energy drinks and decided to make a cartoon based on the game that was described to them, and then some asshat exec with a small penis and a pretentious car paid some guys to make a game based on the cartoon so that he could make a lot of money. If there's a more fitting description of this game than that I haven't found it.

This is DOOM without the heart, the soul, the atmosphere, the aesthetic, or anything else that made the original what it was. It is a copy of a copy of a copy, with all the magic drained out of it and replaced with generic heavy metal, cartoonish demons, and repetitive arena slogs, where you are forced into a single play-style that gets real old real fast.

Anyway. I know I'm in the minority here, and I'm okay with that. It's all peaches and gravy. Thanks for reading."
ronald regan is not the final boss
Obsolete title after Doom Eternal came out. Delist it.
"Doom is modern transplant of a classic which many would say is responsible for kicking off FPS games as a genre. While others may well have enjoyed this title, I found DOOM to be more obnoxious than fun and more of slough through a C+ shooter which I easy could have skipped. While your mileage may vary, this game was not for me."
The Argent energy tower level killed my will to play the game. uninstall
"Garbage.
Unplayable garbage.
Do I need to make an EMS bootdisk to make this fuckery run correctly?
Fuck ID, fuck Bethesda and fuck steam for releasing this unplayable mess!!"
"Nope. it feels like its trying too hard to be edgy and cool. i was expecting a little more honestly. maybe i prefer doom 3 and im a boomer i guess. idk. im happy with doom 1 and 2 i dont need this, this is for the newer generation. its not bad, its just not my cup of tea."

No GNU/Linux release.
"terrible saving system, if your system or game crashes it corrupts your save file without a way to repair it, still a great game just hard to recommend if its erasing hours upon hours of gameplay"

"Good game, plagued with a mixed personality

The game is checkpoint based, but strongly encourages you to explore in ways that are suicidal, which means restarting the same fights over and over again if you (like me) are terrible at jump puzzle and overly curious.
It feels like this game needs a Quick save rather than checkpoints.

Also, glory kills are fun for 2 minutes, then gets really annoying with all the flashing enemies"
"After playing Doom Eternal simply inferior. Much slower pace and redundant. Confusing area design. Crashes on alt-tab.
Buy on sale for 5 bucks max"
"pc has to be restarted bc game froze, cant do anything outsdie of doom while doom is running because doom doesnt let you tab out"
"thats game is so cool and make you so think you are powerful But After 11h Playtime and after you get the last gun that's kinda boring
cool game but just for 10 H"
Mick Gordon's work is the best part of this game. The Bethesda and id software management is well represented ingame by the various creatures of hell that you can slaughter. I downvote this because of how corporate treated Mick.
I fucking hate glory kills and unskippable cutscenes
reddit videogame also mid
Aggressively boring.
Less stolen material than doom eternal. Still regret giving money to Bethesda or ID given the fraud in doom eternal.
Lot of better games to play out there.
"I want to love this game. There's so much awesomeness about it.
I've put just shy of 500 hours into it.

But 7 years after its release it is STILL riddled with bugs. Not one or two. TONS of them.
Bugs that a finished game should not have.
AI bugs.
Clipping bugs.
Animation bugs.
Weapon bugs.
Movement bugs.

I've tried over and over and over to beat ultra-nightmare. Rough estimate of ~200 attempts.
Furthest I've gotten is 6th level.
I have died so many times to things outside my control that I've lost my desire to bother with ultra-nightmare.  
It's so bad that I don't even want to play DOOM Eternal.  
""Why would you one game against another???"" Because it was made by the same developers and if they didn't give a shit about the first one, they won't give a shit about the second one. Common sense.

Tonight's bug was the straw that broke the camel's back.  
It involved me jumping backward from a hellknight jump attack and the model of the hellknight ""glided"" through the air and landed about ~15-20 feet past where he should have, instantly killing me. IDK if I'm allowed to post links to clips, but I do have this one captured on video along with a few other bugs getting me killed.

Other problems I've encountered include:
* Me getting stuck in a grenade throwing animation which prevented any form of attacking
* Being pushed through the floor and dying.  
* Being pushed into stairs and not being able to move anymore. 
* Being pushed through a railing and falling to my death.
* Getting stuck in a reload animation preventing me from attacking anymore.
* Having enemies glide/teleport to places they shouldn't be and killing me (like tonight).
* The list goes on and on. I didn't take the time to write them all down.

The game, without bugs, is a solid 9. Maybe even a 9.5. It's a REALLY good game layout and intended design. However, when you take the bugs into account, the game is a 4. Maybe a 5. It really is pathetic that id software cares so little about the game that fixing these bugs isn't even on their radar. And they're not hard to fix. I say that as a computer programmer myself.
How hard is it to put a function to check if a reload animation or grenade throwing animation is complete? (Spoiler alert: Not hard at all.)
These issues could easily be patched. But id software just straight up doesn't give a damn anymore.
They've gone the route of Rockstar games and the only thing they're focused on is money. They went right onto DOOM Eternal instead of fixing the slew of problems that DOOM 2016 has.

It really does break my heart to put a ""no, I don't recommend this game"" because when the game is working it's an absolute blast to play. You get to rip through demons, tear them apart, play with all kinds of neat guns, and explore some crazy and interesting levels.
But for people like me who want to play through the hardest setting (Ultra-Nightmare) and accept the concept of ""you only get 1 life"", how many hours do you think should be wasted on deaths and failures that are 100% outside of our control? I don't think 1 hour is an acceptable answer, and yet I can assure you I've wasted hour after hour after hour of my life to bugs caused by piss poor programming and lazy debugging.

Again, I'm a programmer. I know how hard it can be to find bugs. But when you have websites like Reddit, GameFAQS, StackExchange, and many other forums with users citing plenty of problems (a lot of the time with video) and the company goes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ instead of fixing the problems, you have to call the company a bad company. And that's what I'm doing. I'm calling them out for horrible quality control, atrocious game testing, and just not giving a damn about fixing their game.

If they don't care, how can we be expected to care?

I haven't seen an update for this game in IDK how long. It's 2023 and the glitches/bugs are still plentiful.

I officially give up. 
I will not be beating this game on Ultra-Nightmare. Not because I'm not capable, but because the cost of my free time is too damn high. I have no desire to get 2-3 hours into a game and die to someone else's lazy coding practices or inability to fully test their own code.
Being ""rewarded"" with failure for things that I have no control over is not something any dev should want associated with their game...but now when people mention this topic, DOOM 2016 will be the game I immediately think of.

Boy what a legacy."
"The combat may be fun, but you spend 80% of the time platforming or backtracking to find stupid crap like key cards. Combat only lasts like 15-60 seconds. Just as you as you start to have fun, it ends and it's back to boring shit. This game is like a bad hand job."
I do not like the publisher.
"looking past the big name everyone is such a big fan of, it's hard to play this game for more than a few hours. honestly not worth 20 dollars.

all tho can't say it's not fun. just a waste of potential really.

this game feels like a early access or demo for something much greater... sadly this is a finished product. which is quite dis pleasing considering i payed 20 dollars for this game."
pooor
"I gave it a try. The soundtrack was nice. The game didn't feel even slightly doom-like.

I played Doom 1 and 2. It just doesn't feel like that. This is tediously slow. Shooting doesn't feel meaningful. I hit that thing, but it didn't even react. I guess just keep shooting? It didn't even make a noise.

The starter gun and shotgun feel absurdly weak. They added in the stupid RPG upgrade system that every other shooter has been using for decades. Why? Because everyone else is using it. That sucks. It was just stupid. slow paced, and lame. This is not doom.

Why does this game now have lore? Why am I seeing walls of text about what is going on? Why am I getting UI prompts to COMPLETELY halt the game and learn how to upgrade a weapon? I don't want that. It doesn't need that. You don't play doom to feel immersed in some weird alternate universe, where you need to talk to the blacksmith about killing 10 Cobalt’s in exchange for a better hilt for your blade. You play doom to shoot demons from hell. It just feels like they have no idea what doom was, or is, or should be. It feels like they were embarrassed that the original games didn't have the kind of deep lore that had originally been planned for the original series (Source: Masters of Doom). There was a very good reason why they didn't do that: it sucked. It was a horrible idea.

The only things this game should have focused on was: The ""feeling"" of shooting. The soundtrack. Cool monsters. Ultra fast movement.

This game had the soundtrack. Where is literally everything else?

We got a naked dude in some lab, comes across some suit, followed by an exposition dump. It's not interesting. It's not fun. It's not doom. Oh, he smashed the panel in the elevator? So we're acknowledging that none of this is interesting? So...why have any of it? It doesn't count as bucking the trend if you mock it, then follow the trend anyway. It's cowardly and pathetic.

This is not doom. This is trash."
"Played for 4 hours, closed game, now game won't open. Thanks Bethesda.

Game is fantastic when you get to pay it though!"
"pile of shit
slow game
DOES NOT HAVE GRAPHICHS SETTINGS IN MAIN MENU YOU HAVE TO WATCH 5 MINUTES OF UNSKIPPABLE CRINGY EDGYNESS IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE SETTINGS
half of the game is cutscenes
who is the edgy 11 years old who thought it was cool to add GloRY KIlLs?
shit on top of shit"
game is poorly made and shit don't buy
so boring and repetitive game its just go to room and shoot demons then go to next room and do the same
BUG LOT
"2/10 
Not sure why this game gets so many positive reviews. It's a pretty typical, mindless FPS with a bland, repetitive map and no unique weapons, enemies or gimmicks to speak of. The story is so utterly trite that it would have been better without any story elements at all. Got bored and quit halfway through."
"Trash wormy company that tries to fuck over their music artist.

"Boring , overated"
"I don't think there are good sound cues for enemies and they bleed into the environment and one another and makes it hard to keep track of who is who and what they're doing. But the breaking point for me is probably the deathpits. Any ledge where if you fall off you're dead. In the frenetic action of a shooter like this you can easily lose track of where you are and plummet to your death. Happened one too many times for me so I'mma  leave a negative review. Honestly, I'd prefer just invisible walls over having to deal with reloads."
Lying about Mick Gordon smh
"I wanted to listen to heavy soundtracks and shoot demons. Instead, I spent 70% of the time navigating some labyrinths, listening to the story I don't care about and collecting pickups. Maybe it gets better over time, but I gave it ~1.5 hours and it was the most boring gaming experience I had in years. I'd rather play DOOM (1993) than waste a single more minute in this one."
bruh i cant sex the pink demon
Overrated game honestly
"4/10
DOOM has many fun and good aspects and many I didn't favor. Most people know what this game is all about, but for those who don't, you run around shooting and slaying demons to save the planet. I liked the weapon variety, the story was not bad and has great graphics. The level design was good, the layouts of the levels are set up pretty well, and never felt lost or confused. I disliked the overall gameplay. It felt like any other game, nothing that stands out. I didn't care for the music, leveling system was disappointing, and just felt like a basic game. If you wait for a sale it could be worth trying, but I don't see myself replaying this game or either getting the next one."
"I've tried a lot of stuff to get this to work without a keyboard and mouse on the Steam Deck and nothing seems to work. I hear it's possible but I haven't found a way yet. Makes it a little hard to enjoy on the go. Also works on Ubuntu Linux with a keyboard and mouse but not with a controller.

Got it working myself. Had to turn off cloud synchronization and delete this folder: /home/deck/.steam/steam/userdata/<steamid>/379720/"
Repetitive and dull.
Can't sex the demons :(
"Listen, this is my own opinion so don't get mad at me because of it; I try to be respectful and still say it the way I see it.
You will have fun with this game for one hour... after that fun hour you will repeat the same action for the entirety of the game - there is not enough content to feel that your journey is worth it, you will quickly upgrade your weapons and never use them ever again, except when you don't have any ammo for the guns you've used for all missions before that one, being precise, the last mission is the only moment you will use all your guns, the rest of the game, such action is not required.
Speaking of guns, the single gun I've decently liked was the super shotgun.
In the early and mid game you feel that there is a lack of action, what you're doing when not fighting is to search for doom dolls, secrets, challenges to upgrade your silent protagonist, you will be done with those very quickly and you will feel empty, subsequently the repetition will install itself and you will just want to be done with it, then, you will have some action but before that happens you will not want it any longer.
The map can be buggy, if it keeps moving for no reason just press the keys W A S D, it will stop doing it.
It has also crashed on me to the point where I couldn't exit the application, not even with the task manager; except those little things, the game has worked fine, at least it doesn't have many bugs and glitches.
Story? The game has three characters, you get little story points from three to three missions and when that happens they don't mean anything, they're just there.
Nothing else could be said, this is all you do, you search for dolls / secrets, you shoot your gun, you move to the next zone, you shoot your gun, you search for dolls / secrets, you fight a boss, the strategy for all boss fights is to move from left to right while jumping, from right to left while jumping  and as you do, to shoot your gun, you will have a big surprise when you decide to play the game this way, they will die and you will pass your level!
I understand this is a return to the old franchise but I want more, this is a 2016 game, if you're going to recreate the classics, you will have to add a new sauce to keep your food fresh and tasty.
This is my first encounter with the Doom series, it hasn't left a good impression on me.

5 / 10."
"There is no feedback or visual input to let you know you are in danger. Makes the whole game stupid, they expect you to monitor your health and constantly track targets. I only have one set of eyes and the design of this game is lazy and stupid."
"I get that the game has nostalgia for players of the originals and would absolutely be up some peoples' roads, but it's not my cup of tea. The graphics are good, the game is well optimised, but the gameplay is mostly repetitive and the story is rather boring."
mid tbh
Grossly overrated. Nothing more than a string of area locked hoard attacks glued together to form confusing stage layouts. Executions drop health so get used to watching those over and over again. Upgrade system and collectables feel completely out of place. Weapons don't have any weight to them. I don’t know who Marty Stratton is and at this point I’m too afraid to ask.

"The game  is basically about running around and killing monster with no story ,nothing in between 
like a arcade game from the 80""s but with much better graphic's

I don't know, instead of feeling like a power rush, playing DOOM made me super paranoid :/
I really wanted to like it"
"played 14hrs, worse than eternal + still salty from corruption of my 14hrs played save file that i didnt get back"
"I wanted to like this since I love OG Doom, but all the levels just feel like a never-ending sequence of arenas rather than actual levels. It's kind of like Doom 3 where you'd go into a room, the same group of enemies spawn in, kill them, repeat ad nauseam, there's no flow to it."
keycard finding simulator
"I certainly enjoyed the game, it just felt boring. Boredom in a doom game is not good. The combat was alright, didn't feel amazing, guns were decent or just interesting, rarely fun to use. Music is fucking GONE at some points where I wanted it, should've pressed more into it considering this is literally a doom game. If you like the doom franchise, get this game. I don't regret my purchase, but I was left wanting more."
"An FPS straight from the nineties with modern graphics slapped on top of it. Dull environments, criminally weightless and boring guns, uninspired enemies and tedious level design. What's worse, the oh-so-lauded soundtrack actually plays pretty rarely in the game and is buried very low in the mix for some reason."
"Honestly I thought it was really boring and repetitive lol.

Having to constantly check the map was annoying as hell too

Music is based though"
"Do not understand why people love this game. Perhaps I just don't like the genre as a whole, but I would not recommend based on my experience."
"WELL the settings are absolutely horrible, meny is a sack of shit... crosshair all the way out in the right side... yawn!! get better at making games you greedy fucktards!!"
Boring game
"Can't remap all keybindings?? Game speed feels like it's made for hyperactive teenagers, man I got old."
I honestly didn't expect such a stupid bug to be in a very known game. Like why is it when I scroll to change my weapons in game the Discord chat that is in the other monitor scrolls too? I can't keep my focus and I am slowly getting sick of it! If there are any community guides or fixes please reply to this review.

A thoroughly downgraded version of Painkiller for people who have never played a videogame in their lives; It's not DOOM.

People who threatened Mick Gordon over the sequel of this formula should legit hang themselves in a friendly match of Halo: Combat Evolved

"dogshit game music good bad devs 

DUke nukem better 

loser neck beard game"
my piss would hit harder than starting weapon
ID Software is a stain.
"The Pros:

Amazing Soundtrack, it was genuinely some of the best music I've heard, well, ever.
Glory kills are pretty cool, if have limited animations.
The guns are pretty cool, but I feel they were a little uninspired at times.
The BFG is just fucking awesome.

The Cons:
Way too short. 8 hrs for an AAA game? (I played on the 2nd hardest difficulty)
The guns all shine in certain scenarios, but sometimes it is a lot better to just spam the same two over and over until something dies.
The final boss was incredibly disappointing. One phase, not hard, and felt more like a damage sponge than a boss.
Story was very straightforward. I don't know if I'm just used to Fromsoft games or what, but the whole thing was kinda meh.

Really hope it's polished up in Eternal."
"Cannot in good conscience leave anything other than a negative review until id Software and Bethesda have taken appropriate action to pay what composer Mick Gordon is owed for his work, and repair his reputation that they have damaged with spurious allegations.

Context for those uninformed : https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce"
Annoying no manual save game. No want to scout for secrets and stuff and lose all before going to next check point. Really stupid for a PC game.
"Great game, Great soundtrack.  Please do not devolve to the pedantic of exploitation, especially someone whose efforts is quite instrumental to your product.  This is not what we expect from corporations."
Kinda boring ngl
"I refused to buy Doom Eternal, i waited initially for the game to come out after loving the first game and loving the soundtrack over anything else in the game. Then the news with their composers came out and the soundtrack for eternal did not seem right, as more has come out i am very happy with my decision. ID software's choice to not only refuse to pay the original composer but attempt  to destroy his reputation with false stories. All in all its doom we know it well. But i will not support a company that has been caught in blatant lies and show no morals. values and decency to respect the people that have made their product sell-able."
If you're here you probably know what DOOM is. Should you play it? Probably. Would I recommend it? No I found it kind of boring. The Super Shotgun(tm) is nice and meaty though.
Christ this game fucking sucks. I honest to god had a much more enjoyable time playing doom 3 on PS3.
"NOTE: This is essentially a copy paste of my review of Doom Eternal

Doom is a great game, however the way id Software (**Under Marty Stratton**) allegedly abused Mick Gordon both mentally and financially, in the development of its sequel Doom Eternal leaves me appalled.
Due to this, I will leave my review as negative.

EDIT:
While Bethesda has responded with a public statement backing id Software and subsequently the actions of Marty Stratton, they have yet to properly release evidence to support their claim, unlike Mick Gordon.

Because of this, I will only change my review to a positive if either the following occurs:
(a) Marty Stratton is fired / Mick Gordon is offered reparation + public apology, with Marty Stratton's redit post being taken down.

(b) Bethesda and id Software properly prove their narrative with strong evidence that challenges Mick Gordon's claims, and thus support the notion that they are indeed being attacked by Mick Gordon. 

Additionally, here are the links to corroborate my view 
Mick Gordon's evidence:

bethesda is a super fucking garbage company. fuck marty stratton.
"I know that I'm a minority here, but I really don't like this game.
And I like old shooters, like Doom, Duke and especially Quake.
Yes, the game is polished and fluid, so what? 
The aesthetics is cartoonish, and lacks of the atmosphere and the old Doom biomechanical terror.
The glory kills force you to play always in the same way, bad addition. Furthermore, they become repetitive very soon.
The OST is beautiful, better aspect of the game. But it kicks in rarely, usually there are only ambient sounds.  
I have been so disappointed in playing this title, expecially by knowing the general enthusiasm. I do not recommend it."
I'm not supporting anything else from id Software as long as Marty Stratton is involved.
Yuck Bethesda
Justice for Mick Gordon!!!
Bad company
I was only here for the music and I guess it's time for me to end my friendship with ID Software
justice for mick
Wish I could like this game.
Mick Gordon deserves better
Justice for Mick Gordon
Mick Gordon deserves better
did mick gordon dirty
Bethesda screwed Mick Gordon just like they have screwed every game franchise under their umbrella. Can't wait to see how bad they fuck up Elder Scrolls next!
"Boycott id software, Mick Gordon deserves better"
Marty Stratton is a scumbag. Give Mick Gordon his pay.
"Bethesda has made its decision, choosing to double down on supporting the predatory, uncouth members of id software, Marty and Chad. Bethesda, by extrapolation, does not respect its contractors, choosing instead to champion toxic execs and Chads that claim ownership on works they contribute next to no effort towards. Bethesda is plummeting towards the title of their fourth elder scrolls game: Oblivion. At this rate, their moral compass is sinking straight to EA/Ubisoft. This company is not worth supporting."
An amazing game made by a god-awful company!
"id, Bethesda, and Zenimax can all go to hell."
May your troubles be many for what you did to Mick Gordon
"Constantly blocks, cannot play"
Justice for Mick Gordon. Fuck Marty Stratton
This is the only power we have as consumer after we already spoke with our wallet.
Mick Gordon
"Justice for Mick Gordon.

Marty Stratton, Please resign and leave ID Software."
"I used to have extremely fond memories of this game. Now, as soon as the game's incredible soundtrack starts to play, it immediately reminds me of Mick Gordon and what he went through at the hands of iD and especially Marty Stratton. Game is poisoned for me now, a bit like the first scene of Dumbo.

If you intend to go back and play this game, do not research the drama; it will give you a gross feeling about supporting iD Software."
"Id causing shit with Mike Gordon.
Fuck you Id"
"Marty Stratton should be fired:

https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce"
Too fast paced which tires me out quickly.
"Good game but poor behind the scenes mess, super sad to see happen."
"Fuck Marty, lying piece of shit. You should be the one without a professional career left, you disgusting corporate slave."
basic boomer shoot done better by numerous developers that actually pay their staff and give them reasonable terms. do not give them a cent.
Pay Mick Gordon for his music!
"its okay, for me personally its just too easy and kinda bland honestly. some of the design of the monsters and some of the levels look out of place and weird and argent enegy tower as a level sucks. it also features the usual boring key hunt resident evil-like but way more shit than resident evil's key hunts which makes the key hunt parts boring and forgettable and some levels feature a random massive difficulty spike. also @#$% you id software.

(WARNING THIS REVIEW IS MY OPINION, YOU CAN THINK THIS IS PEAK FICTION AND I WILL NOT GIVE A SHIT, THIS IS JUST MY OPINION ABOUT THE GAME)"
Id fucked over mick gordon
What a bunch of scumbags. Did you read Mick Gordon's full statement about the Doom Eternal soundtrack?
"Hey Marty! Hey id!

Pay and respect the people that helped you rebuild DOOMs fame.

Fuck you!"
pirate it
Take a look on Reddit to read how they treat their contractors and see if you still want to buy the game.
Give justice to the man who gave your videogame it's whole soul and made it undoubtedly better and memorable. Mick Gordon deserves better.
There were a lot of demons but I didn't see Marty Stratton so I must've missed him. 0/10  experience.
Pay mick gordon
Trash company trash game lol
Maybe Marty Stratton is the real demons we made along the way.
"Marty very bad
Mick very good"
"https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce
Don't give your money to greedy, abusive, selfish people"
L + made by id software
Give Mick Gordon the money and the apology that he's owed.
"MICK GORDON DESERVED BETTER
https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce"
"Game is great, everything else is not.
Mick Gordon deserves better, screw id."
Pay Mick Gordon for his work you cheap fucks
level design sucks
"Doom 1 and Doom 2 were better - more interesting graphics, better feedback when you are hit (your face + sound + screen flash)

I think in fact Dooms 1 and 2 graphics are better (despite being dated).

Plus it has working save and load anywhere, not stupid checkpoints."
"Gave me corrupt save file after 2 hours of playing, I know it isnt too bad but it just killed my enjoyment."
"demon killing the video game. if you wanted something interesting, you've come to the wrong game. it just killing with loud music playing in the background for hours. people who claim this game is a masterpiece are crayon eaters who have the attention span of a goldfish"
"If you enjoy spending 2 hours trying to stop the frame cap from jumping around from 30 to 60 to 75 to uncapped and whatever the fuck it feels like every 5 minutes, this is the game for you. 
Absolute trash, add a frame cap option instead of making people mess with your shitty v-sync settings for years, to no conclusion.
Thanks for wasting my time."
Glory kill glory kill glory kill glory kill glory kill glory kill. Oh snap missed that glory kill demon regained his health in an infinite loop. Rip what could have been a fun shooter and in turn is ruined with dead stops in action to GLORY KILL. Also a shame after a huge bloody battle you look back and see nothing because bodies despawn in seconds.
"Its super short and there aren't enough enemies to shoot, Im not satisfied"
"Music and graphic is even alright.
Solo game: 4/10.
Multiplayer: 2/10.
Overrated game."
It is unfortunate that Bethesda games can only be played in Latin Spanish on consoles and not on PC.
no sex
god this game is fucking boring...
"Ultrakill ruined me like massive horsecock. Doom isn't even in the same universe.





This ad has been brought to you be New Blood Interactive"
"Trash game, crashes all the time. somehow made it to mid game then the game told me my save file was corrupted. asked for refund and see how it goes"
fuck lifesteal
shooting is weak as fuck. headshots are not satisfying at all. Better go play some real shooters like blood or cultic
"Endless shooting and circling grows tedious with time, which is a shame as lots of work has clearly been put into this game"

"boring

first Wolfenstein, now this? I'm beggining to think Bethesda can't make good FPS"
It was alright but didn't make me excited to buy the next installment. Played on the hardest difficulty. The multiplayer doesn't appeal to me.
Annoying checkpoint save system
"I had a problem with the game crashing constantly. Apparently the solution was to disable v sync, which did solve it, but I'm leaving this as a negative review because apparently this is an issue affecting anyone using a G sync or Freesync monitor so that's a pretty major bug to still have 6 years after release now."
The game's constant and boring
HORRIBLE on lower end devices like laptops and the Nintendo Switch.
"I...guess this is just not for me, I couldn't enjoy it
Everything felt so repetitive and I couldn't force myself to finish the last two levels"
never loads stuck at 78%
"Buggy as fuck since this is a bethesda game, starts in the wrong resolution or on the wrong monitor every single time. It happens in every bethesda game. Game is fine, company producing it is not"
★★☆☆☆ It's not a shooting game. It's jump king + room escape.
"was just kind of boring, was pretty much doing the same thing on different maps over and over."
"I was really trying to enjoy this game but after playing Ultra Kill I was looking for another good movement shooter to play, Now I knew this would be slower paced than UK but the fact that it's just small combat sections with prolonged and encouraged exploration in a game that was advertised to be non-stop gory action just really bored me

The combat that there was felt decent though, The lack of hit indication didn't help the feel though and the story was alright.

Update nearly 2 years later: I gave the game another chance and got further this time, I still stand by what I said, the near forced exploration and super short combat sections really kill this game"
Only being able to save at checkpoints is no fun. One should be able to save any time especially when one trys something dangerous. I quit!!!
My save game corrupted more than halfway through the game on the highest difficulty. Fuck you.
"The game isn't very fun.  I was convinced to buy this instead of Eternal, i was in the mood for a quick easy fps and it didn't even deliver on that.  I didn't get Eternal because I didn't want something difficult but this wasn't it.  It's a awkward in between between too easy and a fun satisfying gorefest, it's just not fun.  Get Eternal it's better at both aspects than this one."
"on one level if u enter through the wrong door u literally get softlocked and have to restart the whole game. *puts on a mask made of human feces very reminiscent to that of [i] 'The Bullshit Man'  [/i]  à la James Rolfe's internet series [i] 'You Know What's Bullshit?!' [/i]

Bullshit Man voice: and THATS fuckin bullshit -_-

♫ banjo instrumental interlude ♫

MOOOOO 🐄

♫ comical brap sound effect plays ♫"
"Stop looking for a reason to not buying this game, Go get it now."
keeps crashing
No Nightmare/Ultra-Nightmare achievement nor any kind of reward. Sadge.
"The game is really good actually, but Doom Eternal exists and pretty much makes this game obselete in terms of gameplay and level design and lore and visuals"
"For people who just enjoy blood gore and shooting this game is for you, i am a heavy rpg and rts player so my only reason for thumbs downing the game is simply because its not my style."
"Game is absolutely broken. If you have an AMD GPU sorry, cant play a game from 2016 cause they wont fix it. Thanks Bethesda."
"Says i have 95 hours but ive never been able to play. On PC i cant disable gyro controls, and it doesnt accept input on the deck."
"Why?

Why do game designers still put jumping puzzle levels in first person shooter video games? Why do they think that when we buy a Doom title we have any interest in playing Super Mario Bros?"
this shit game every time i luanch game my save game has deleted
"I tryied to play the game but an error is happening blue screen and the computer is rebooted, I couldn't play it"
"Half of the charm of this game is in Multiplayer, which is not as lively now as it released years ago. If you have a lot of friends or people to play with, then take it as it is. But otherwise I suggest if you buy this then buy it on a sale so you can enjoy the other half, which is the story campaign, without losing too much value."
"F this atmosphere ,surroundings and enemies. ...but never want to play doom games even for free.
never rushed anything ass this game.

5.5 - 10
 
fuck mars and hell."
"Singleplayer mode gets boring in a matter of hours and multiplayer is the single most frustrating pile of garbage I have seen in years.

And for God's sake, if the game can't even focus the mouse so that it doesn't go off to another screen no matter which mode you're using, what can you expect from the game?

--- EDIT---

I want to continue this review by saying that if you want to play this game, PIRATE IT. Just pirate it. You can thank me later when you can play the campaign and have more or less fun in there when some bug doesn't get you killed (like occasionally clipping through floors to your death after a glory kill). But stay the F*CK away from multiplayer. Barely anyone playing this game anymore, always at least one cheater in every match because of the lack of any anti-cheat and quickswitching weapons takes away the purpose of any remaining sense and purpose.

---FINAL EDIT---

DONE! Last achievement ripped out! And I straight up refuse to play this game ever again. Keep your f*cking game, script kiddies. Even TF2 isn't as bad multiplayer in this game and that should say a LOT."
boring
"If boomer shooters were a thing then this would be the poster child. It's tedious, dull, repetitive and unashamedly so to such an extent that I don't even know if that's a bad thing. I mean I don't like those weirdly realistic hunting games so it feels a bit like criticising one of those for spending too much time on waiting for a duck to appear. Doom however is bland so if that's all part of the boomer shooter appeal then fine but this game has incredibly dull graphics (Quake 3 levels of brown, grey and dark green bland) with uninspiring enemy variety, way too many upgrade systems which is somehow cancelled out by none of them being interesting, a deliberately tongue in cheek crap story with the joke being that even the protagonist doesn't care and combat that reaches the lofty height of being okay.

You run, you shoot, you jump (or not since jumping mostly results in instant death) and you tediously use finishers to get more health or ammo. The whole finisher mechanic might have been fun if it weren't overused but you'll have to use it constantly because the games combat is designed around seeing each enemy as a particularly rascally packet of chips that can only be opened by pulling their tits off first. As a result it stops being fun after the first few goes and instead simply slows down the combat which is otherwise fine albeit hamstrung by enemies telegraphing their appearance five miles in advance with obnoxious screams, glowing red light and a ticker-tape parade announcing any new types.

I guess if you like generic run and gun shooters which give zero shits about story, character development, interesting visuals or any video game developments this side of the millennium then this is the game for you. Personally I'd rather go to a pilates with galloping diarrhoea then play this visual equivalent."
Justice for Mick Gordon
"main chapter name

thank you bethesda"
"The visuals are cool and animations are cool, but the gunplay sucks."
"It's a turn-based strategy for people who are uncomfortable with the blazing speed of Windows Solitaire. DoomGuy seems to be fat, lazy, pregnant, both legs broken and have a hangover.

Game is painfully slow and this is intentional to push you into the very specific way of play, like glory kills, chainsaw etc. to show you cutscenes."
a whole lotta nothin just to get a 15 seconds of a banger that is constantly being interrupted by glory kills
"[h1] 「1回プレイスルーしてもういいかな」タイプの残念ゲー。 [/h1]

This game just does not hold up. Its brought down by tiny little details that add up and make it overall worse. Shields don't matter. Pinky's AI is broken. The regular shotgun becomes useless after you get the super shotgun. The checkpoints are too few and far between. You can die in the midst of grabbing a ledge or doing a glory kill. Obviously all of these things are fixed in Doom eternal NOW but that just makes this title more sad.
can't skip start logos etc
"definitely a good game, be warned tho, game will crash depending on your driver, and can be quite difficult to fix"
doeset run on widows. or any machine or electonic. hi dont know they got away this? selling the concept of a doonis such a down grade of this oringal
"Typical Bethesda game I guess.

Pistol weapon firing can get stuck losing control of the shooting completely and cant do anything.

Another franchise ruined by Bugthesda garbage"
Id Software panders to manchildren: the video game
Glad i got this on a sale absolute pile of trash. Much preferred the old doom.
i kept getting an FATAL ERROR: wglCreateContextAttribsARB failed
"Honestly very mediocre. Combat has no weight to it, no sense of mass. The weapons are forgettable and uninspired. And forget about any sort of difficulty, because as soon as you start running low on health, you can just mash up one of the many flashing blue goons and jump right back up to half a bar. It doesn't feel like a Doom game of any sort, it feels like Unreal Tournament. 

At least I only spent a few bucks on this."
"I really wanted to play this game, but the sound effect, the ping everytime you pick up health makes me go fucking bonkers. I can't stand high pitch sounds like that... Anyway, waste of time."
"Man this game's just a downgrade from DOOM 3. Like the lighting is ass, the gameplay is boring, the story is trash like dude, choose a struggle please!

Just play DOOM 3 BFG Edition instead, worth ten times more of your time than this trash game."
"Doesn't launch and hasn't been patched for months it seems. 
I'll sadly have to refund it.

It's still a great game tho played it on console and had a blast with this game."
could not hear game audio
"dont buy, this game is genuinely fucking awful. the ammo system sucks absolute ass and there is no difficulty whatsoever.

dont even get me started on how slow and boring the actual gameplay is"
"I did not expect this to disappoint me so much - The weapons feel unsatisfying to use (except of course Glory Kills!) and the bosses are just not fun. Storywise, it's also way too short"
bad game..and stole my game..when i buy game from steam..

"ive play'ed for a long time and when i was having a boss fight with the evil girl that turns into a spider
i realised i had no ammo
so i had to use the gun you get at the start of the game 
do you think i can beat her with just a beginner gun 
no i dont have the time so bye bye game :I
im lazy to restart the mission 
after this i will buy 7 days to die"
A good looking walking simulator.  30% rip n tear and 70% traversal through an empty map.
no sex with demon
"Honestly, it is absolutely beyond me why this game receives such praise. The feel and impact of guns is very lackluster, most weapons are call of duty tier nerf guns. While the 'finish him' animations are sort of well executed, the visual damage of firearms on enemies is non-existent—aside from headshots. You might as well be shooting robots because there is no impact on the flesh.  On top of the fact that this is not a very good FPS, it forces upon you a substantial amount of parkour which in conjunction with the atrocious jumping mechanics and primitive physics is unbearable torture. Many of the maps are confusing multi-level labyrinths and you have to jump around to find whatever it is you're looking for. These interruptions to the core gameplay loop do not, in any way, add to the game but only serve to frustrate the player. Countless times I would finish a level, spend 10 minutes parkouring around just to suddenly fall into the abyss and realize that the checkpoint is at the start of the level. Lastly, ID tech engine is a steaming pile of rubbish and you are guaranteed to encounter many crashes throughout your playthrough. 

To sum up: very primitive and outdated game design, second-rate shooting experience, and terrible technical execution."
"Pretty fun game, but ruined by Bethesda level bugs and weird pathfinding/wall glitching by the demons."
Doesnt work anymore on my 1060. Takes 20 minutes to load and if I die once it freezes. FPS lags as well.
After not playing game for months game does not work. bugs. shit game
"It's a great game that for no reason at all suddenly runs like shit when it used to run amazing. I am using the same computer with basically the same components but I get sudden frame drops when it used to run at 60fps and higher, and I am not the only one experiencing this."
"kinda mid looked cooler when markiplier did it :(
gmod but blood"
Game keeps crashing on startup. I have a 3080 and this game does not launch. Garbage game
"Doom is a very well made game, but I don't like its design.  It was designed to use a ""push forward combat loop,"" and that's the problem.  It calls itself an FPS, but it really isn't.  What's worse is that it kind of thinks that it IS an FPS, so large portions of the game are based on that...but then penalize you for playing that way.

The best description for Doomguy is that he is a melee vampire.  This is absolutely true.  Despite what the lore tells you iin the first mission, the Doomsuit is absolute dogshit armor, and even the weakest enemies cut through it like butter.  The only way to stay alive is to constantly be eating health globes.  That forces a sort of frantic, always-killing type of gameplay.  Fine, great, I guess I can live with that.  The problem is that Doomguy generates health globes by doing glory kills, and glory kills are melee.  He generates ammunition by killing things with the chainsaw...in melee.  The devs REALLY wanted to make push forward combat a thing, so there really is only one way to play the game.  You either focus your entire style of play on melee, or you die.  Repeatedly.  Sure, you can use your guns, but it's only to either clear trash or to set up enemies for melee kills.  You spend every fight constantly trying to get enemies to glow yellow so you can melee them.  It honestly feels like the game PENALIZES you for accidentally actually killing things with your guns, even though almost every weapon is a gun, every upgrade is for guns, and the game is a farking first person shooter...supposedly.

If you like constantly charging and ripping things apart with your bare hands (literally), you may enjoy this game, but if you're looking for a first person shooter that you can play like a first person shooter, this may not be the game for you.  It wasn't for me."
"VERY strong aesthetic, fantastic score, brilliant production. Seriously, wow. But ASK YOURSELF:

Do you want to play through an FPS where you literally don’t stand still for 0.5 seconds? 

Yes? cool, I respect you

No: this game is not for you (but this review is)"
ill just say it; hasnt aged well
"The games not bad, I just cant get into it. It feels like the epitome of a mindless shooter. The shooting is really good and its not difficult to pick up, but theres no story, nothing to follow. The color scheme also is awful. Its like if an emo edge lord made a game...Throw satanic imagery in, make it dark, and have metal music in the background, Who cares about why youre doing what youre doing? I like Shooters, I like the composer, I even am fond of the engine...Its just, none of it was implemented with any thought in mind here. its really dumb down. Go here and shoot things...I wish there was a story, and a better color palate (one involving more than just dark red and urine yellow). I feel like Wolfenstein just did everything better with nearly the same ingredients.
Played about four hours, on the first available hard difficulty (not nightmare since that requires an unlock)."
"Maybe its because I'm playing the game wrong, but a lot of the mechanics in the game are tedious, 99% of objectives (so far, I'm only on ""hell on mars"") are look around for an item, defeat waves of enemies, walk to objective with said item, fight waves of enemies. I understand that fighting waves of enemies is kinda the point of doom, like thats the whole schtick, but the area locked wave survival gets old after a bit. The guns feel nice, and the movement is simple and works for the game style. Overall I'd give it a 4/10, fun mechanics and gun play, boring gameplay loop."
"I'm not sure how to review this game as it fits into one of those more niche categories.

1st: The Doom franchise has a long history, so no need to get into that. This version is better thought of in the context of the immersive Doom 3 (2003).
2nd: Doom 3 was [at the time] a modernized version of the classic with a tough campaign/story
3rd: 2016 Doom starts off sort of the same way as Doom 3 - you're an unnamed marine sent from Earth to stop the demonic invasion on Mars.
4th: In the real years that've passed, game visuals and mechanics have all been modernized.
5th: 2016 Doom seems to assume that some success has been achieved in Doom 3, as there's no seeming campaign and it's just keep killing demons.

Final verdict: This seems to me like a 'continue playing' option to Doom 3. I got bored immediately (I'm one of those 'campaign' people unless the game is really special), and stopped immediately as you can see by my play time."
no clue why I dislike it so much but I really like DOOM Eternal
I LOVE DOOM
Game sucks ass it fucking won't even let me fix the steam cloud error fuck DOOM 2016
"Solid gameplay, delightfully graphic murder and gore at every corner, a lot of references to the older titles and a true powertrip fueled by the realization YOU are the boogeyman the DEMONS scare their children with.

Buuut, the story is expectedly simplistic, and whilst you get more and more enemy types up to a certain point in the game, it nontheless manages to get stale and repetitive towards the later bits, with the difficulty only being increased by putting you into into ever longer fights with fewer checkpoints. Also, oddly enough, I found that the very first weapon (past the lol-pew-pistol) and the very first mod remained my go-to weapon of the choice throughout the entire game, until the railgun came about, at which point I was using two weapons. Maybe just a playstyle choice.

In the end, I don't really feel like the game is worth replaying, which, at 10h, is not the best hallmark. 

Probably get it at a sale, but don't expect anything mind-blowing out of it.
I'll go for a neutral rating here, which, given the otherwise positive score, means a disrecommend."

bad
"Game gets stuck between loading screens, have to hard kill the game and after that the computer works fine but if I turn it off or restart it the hard drive has to go to a recovery mode for some reason, only happens after playing this game."
"as far as RPGs go Doom has to rank somewhere near the top:

Pros: 
- slick controls, lots of weapons
- not much in terms of plot but the characters are as intricate as Dart, Lavitz and the rest of the Legend of Dragoon cast
- makes u feel like a complete badass
- no enemy sponges
- doesn't overstay its welcome but has plenty of replayability/NG+ features à la Chrono Trigger
- there's a total of 5 minutes of forced cutscenes, otherwise go ham, king

Cons: 
- very little variety in terms of dialogue choices
- no Pacifist run? 
- the enemies scream too loud it's aggravating
- single-handedly responsible for the ""Video games make u violent"" narrative
- enemies are bullet sponges
- lack of realism (how would people get to Mars anyway)

Overall I give this game the highest score imaginable"
I was having a good time until the game would get stuck 95% loading and then never finish and when I got the BFG it crashed the game and I couldn't even force quite it
soooooo bad wa rb al 3bad
Mid game
"So the main problem I have with this game is the secret areas.  It has cool hidden switches and secret areas to unlock just like the original Doom but in the original these rooms just had extra health and ammo and stuff.  Maybe you could even get a new weapon half a level sooner than you would pick it up normally.  That was your reward.  In this new game the secret areas all contain PERMANENT upgrades to your character.   This punishes the player if they miss even a single secret.  You feel like you HAVE to 100% all secret areas, especially if you are playing on harder difficulty levels.

That makes it so now you feel compelled to use a walkthrough so you dont miss anything and this really slows down the gameplay and makes it much more of a chore.  I like the permanent upgrades in this game and it makes sense for secret areas to have them to make finding the secrets rewarding, but they need a way to make 100%ing them unmissable either by letting you warp back to cleared levels (Not REDO the level with full respawns, I mean just go back to an empty zone) or they need some kind of in game map/secret tracker thing that can show you where they are and make sure you don't accidentally progress to the point where you cant go back and get them.  Like maybe after you beat the levels boss or something you can get the secrets marked on the map.  Whatever, just dont make these secrets missable!  It's really really annoying."
cant play for more than 20 minutes without a splitting migraine. does not happen with other games for me. still fun
Play Ultrakill
"After several hours:

Level design is confusing as hell (lol!)
Weapons feel very, very weak and clips are far too small.
Platforming in FPS is just a lesson in frustration - I'd play Mario if I liked platformers.

The music was excellent, however.  Maybe I'll just buy the soundtrack to the follow-up Doom Eternal instead of the game.

Glad I didn't pay full price, after the truly abysmal tower level I'm using dev mode just to see the game through.  nuDoom just isn't for me."
bad
"I've been caught in yet another conundrum of journalist ethics.  I didn’t care for Doom, I found it to be monotonous and boring, the music was fine, the levels looked very nice but apart from that they were fine.  So by all means it should get a thumbs down, a red mark because I didn’t like it.  End of story.

The problem is Doom is a very well made game.

In no universe can you say Doom is objectively a bad game.  You can say you didn’t personally like it, but you can’t say it’s intrinsically a bad game.  The shooting, though I found it to be repetitive, is satisfying in all the right ways and all the guns carry a nice punch to them.  The Ai is reactive enough to put up a fight but stupid enough to still make you feel like a badass.  All the animations are smooth.  The gameplay loop is simple but effective.  The music is very well composed and fits the aestetic well.  The levels are open ended but still carefully built to give fights a natural flow, making each fight unique regardless of times played.  The levels themselves are all very pretty and have a shocking amount of detail in every corner.  Even the story is surprisingly well written, acted, and executed despite it not needing much of one.

By all means this is the video game of video games, if that makes any sense.  It is meant to be fun first and cannot be replicated on any other form of media.  The feeling it tries to capture can only be done through the medium of video games, and it does a damn good job at it too.

So why didn't I like it?  How can I praise a game but at the same time give it a thumbs down?

I’ve played a lot of games in my time.  Probably too many to be healthy and though it’s done little for me in terms of practical application it has, at least, given me a broad understanding of the medium.  In that time I’ve played a lot of games I’ve liked and even more that I didn’t.

It’s usually pretty easy to tell the difference between a game made by a bureaucratic team trying to maximize profits vs a game made by a passionate team of developers who wanted to make a fun game.  Of course there are exceptions on both sides (Mafia: Definitive and Far Cry 3 come to mind) but for the most part it’s fairly consistent.

You can feel the love put into Doom.  How every aspect was created with the specific intention of making the game fun.  The interesting story and beautifully crafted maps are just icing on the cake.  It really is a great game.

So when it comes down to what I actually don't like about the game it can be kind of hard to put into words.

This is of course a “me” problem and I am in the vast minority here.  All my friends who’ve played Doom love it and sing its praise.  It just doesn’t scratch the same itch for me, it doesn’t click.  I don’t get that heart pounding dopamine strike from the fast paced action of Doom.  I get about the same amount of enjoyment out of a Call of Duty campaign.

Now I’m not saying Call of Duty is anywhere close to the level of polish and quality of Doom I’m just saying I have about the same amount of fun.

It’s kind of weird too because I’m not adverse to fast paced violent games.  I love Hotline Miami, Black Mesa, TF2, and Wolfenstein.  Though not the same design philosophy as Doom these games cater to a similar gameplay loop and style.  But for some reason Doom ends up lower on my list then the others.

Maybe I’m a nihilistic prick who hates video games, maybe I’m to stupid to get it.  Or maybe I’m just too pretentious and think I'm above it all.

I think the most telling thing I can put here is my favorite Doom is Doom 3, the game that is the least like Doom out of the franchise.  I like the tight corridors, dark atmosphere, and slower more methodical gameplay.  That’s just more my speed.

Doom is a fine game, maybe even a great game, that I didn’t like.  And that’s okay.  

Is it worth picking up anyway?  Honestly, yes, chances are you will enjoy this game even if I didn't, so I don’t know why I even took the time to write all this out.

7/10 - Yes, yes, I know a high score for a thumbs down but I can’t help it, it’s a well made game giving it a lower score based on my own biases wouldn’t be fair to the devs.  It's a useless review score by some nobody on the internet get over it."
"I like the DOOM game very much, but one problem that bothered me a lot was that I can't connect to the servers of this game because of the sanctions in my country (Iran) and it bothers me a lot. I hope all the people of the world can freely enjoy the video game."
Guns lack punch and you spend more time looking for ammo than actually shooting things. If you want mindless action there's way better alternatives than this garbage.
kkaka
"great game, looks amazing and gameplay is probably really good. unfortunately for me its broken and crashes every time i try to play it. and its not a pc issue as i can run doom eternal at higher settings with no issues. never even got to the first battle room."
"Extremely slow and boring, Eternal is SO much better.

Probably was designed for old Boomers with the Reflexes of Sloths."
"Feels like an enormous downgrade after playing doom eternal, slow clunky takedowns, demons look off and gunplay feels worse. Play doom eternal instead"
"Great game but IMO doesn't deserve better review score than doom eternal so a thumbs down!!!
But still a great buy just play it before playing eternal"
i keep crashing 10 secs into the game i have a good pc and my radeon app says that a driver has malfunction but i updated them all and still did nothing
Annoying stuttering on a RTX 3070!! asked for a refund 20 min after.
"I fell pretty disappointed, having finally played the game. I loved watching DOOM videos on the internet, like playthroughs, boss fights, etc. But in reality it felt soo boring and repetitive. The story is laughable, so treating it like a FPS game i'll say it's good. Not a fan of the level construction. I got it for €4.99 on the Summer sale, there are much better purchases than this.
5/10"
krews kreod mesf resac rels dela :P
"I tried to play this game multiple times, but just couldn't make my self continue playing it. It feels bland.
I had such high hopes from the game due to the praise it receives, but I guess this game is just not for me. I really wish I could  like it, as I wanted to complete it and experience what everyone loves about this game, but I just can't force myself to play it anymore."
"Ive read alot of reviews both on and outside of steam that claim this game is either so good it cures cancer or so boring you fall asleep playing it. From my experience, I disagree with both perspectives. To keep it short and sweet, the first 3/4s of this game is awesome. You slowly get more and more powerful and master killing a variety of demons, not only statistically improving but getting better at the game itself. There are occasional moments where the pacing falters, either due to you spending way to long trying to figure out how to proceed with a level or mismanaging supplies (due to the fact you dont know how many more enemies you have to kill), but the game is able to consistently provide a fun slash and tear experience despite its simplicity. If you are going to play the campaign fresh for the first time like I did, I recommend using powerups as soon as you find them and not worrying about weapon/armor points. I rarely found secret areas or did challenges and had more armor/weapon/energy points then I knew what to do with. 

So why the negative review?

Roughly after the ""ice"" level, (youll know what Im referring too once/if you have finished the campaign), this game goes downhill quickly. For context, the final fight of the ice level was a long bloody and intense experience which I consider the unofficial ending of the game. Its a great culmination where you fight all the demons youve fought so far using your vast arsenal, constantly dodging and ""parkour-ing"" around the level. However after this, youre forced to play through a repetitive boring slug fest of a level which not only feels too similar to previous levels, but lacks any sense of intensity that previous levels had. At this point you also get so much ""upgrade points"" and ammo that you basically mow down everything you see easily, with no strategy required. 
WHERE ITS GETS REALLY BAD
If it was just for the cons that ive already mentioned, I probably would still recommend the game, but I have to address the disaster that is the ending.
This entire game, you feel like your tearing through a horde of the undead, clawing to get your way to some sort of a big bad guy or final battle. I was excited to absolutely pulverize one of the scientists or decapitate Satan himself. Suddenly, your thrown in front of a bullet sponge with a annoying arena mechanic. I killed it on my first try ready to continue playing the game. What I didnt realize is that it was the final boss. I imagined I would at least get a satisfying cutscene to end the  game off after such an anticlimactic gameplay ending, but I was disappointed when I saw a boring setup for a sequel with no resolution. 

While the story isnt as bad as other games like Farcry 5 or the Witcher 3, and the game has great initial worldbuilding and gameplay; the ending is so anticlimactic and disappointing that I have no choice but to not recommend."
"I wish i could love this game, but i just can't.

Early game is a grind for upgrades. There are wide open maps. A CRAP ton of lore, reading, talking, and some cut scenes where you spend most of the time wondering around and walking instead of killing demons. The fights are really just waaay to short and disappointing for a game meant to be about ripping and tearing.

I just find this game overall boring.
Buy the soundtrack. It's better than the game."
"Been troubleshooting for hours 
to fix the game audio is cutting out and crackling 
Don't get this if you use a wireless headsets"
"★★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆

4 out of 10 talamitos."
awesome game but despite having a borderless window mode it doesn't work making this game pointless with multi monitor setups.
"Very good FPS, horrible platformer."
"gameplay is fine, im sure console normies love this: it spoon-feeds you everything. mick gordon has fingers he stole from the devil and holds literally this entire game up with them."
this game sucks SO SO SO SO MUCH. avoid this crap even if its for free.
very bad performace 0/10
"This is more so a review of the Nightmare difficulty.

First impression was terrible. Sluggish combat, well your player is slow, but the enemies are fast. In fact, they are so fast, glory kills to heal you will get you killed. I play Nightmare because in Doom 2 it's fun, the enemies are already there, so keeping track of them is actually not only possible but fun, the AI can track you, especially with Brutal Doom, but it's manageable. Here, they feel like they read player input to make their aim as good as possible.

Weapon choice early on is attrocious as well, the shotgun does little damage, at close range you'll dump a 1/6th of your ammo into one enemy, but it takes so long that the other enemies in the level have caught up to you.

I can manage all of that. That's fine. It's not great. It feels terrible but I know the game does get faster.

You cannot fail fast though. In Doom 2 if you failed, you reloaded and were back in it in less than 10 seconds. In Doom 2016 you'll take a full minute of animation to get back up."
"Doom 2 player here. Doom 2016 is short, fully linear, average FPS. Very often you get lost and don't know where to go = frustration. The gameplay is too simple = just run and gun and clear one room after another (only then you will be allowed to go to another room... wtf mechanic?). The game also forces you to do arcade jumping! - one mistake and you start from the bottom = frustration. Music is only so-so. Not recommended and not worth the full price."
"I can't not play this game,

Always crash at launch, i have try to many options to fix it, but still can't play it, and can't refund it"
"feels weird and clunky, its not THAT bad of a game, but its not doom"
hella repetetive
no
"Short story: Has a fan of DOOM 1 & 2, I didn’t enjoy it one bit. You may like it if you love frantic action, maybe like serious Sam.

The original level design or DOOM 1/2, the personality of each kind of monster, the management of weapon type and ammo. Sadly, there is none of this in this Doom.

Levels are ultra linear. You move from one pseudo room to another, you take a powerup, they lock the doors behind you. 1000 monsters’ teleports around you, everything is so fast that you cannot appreciate each monster style… You just kill them so quickly… doors are now unlocked. Take spare life and ammo, then repeat.

It just gets worst the further you are in the “campaign”. Plus the bosses are not interesting at all (but that’s a tradition in Doom).

PRO
- Graphics are fine (nothing special these days)
- Buttery smooth (but who cares to run 300 fps in solo?)
- Smooth gameplay (the way you move and kill monsters)
- Skill/weapons tree

CON
- Usually no backtracking possible: means often too late to unlock some secrets of the map without replaying it.
- The skill/weapons tree does not matter much: You’ll get most of it easily by the end of the game
- Run out of ammo? No problem, just chainsaw the simple monster, and voila 80% ammo restored for all your weapons!
- There are bugs! (Seriously? This is such a simple game and I had something like 20 bugs such as invisible walls, blocked in collisions, cannot switch weapons (!))
- Old school check points (want to stop NOW and resume later? No luck, you may lose some progress!)
- You have a double jump, but a lot of “platforms” have invisible collision so you cannot jump on them."
i'm more of a grounded slayer
Bit slow. Violence always ended as I just get into it. More kill less walk
bad
"The audio just slowly cuts out and stops working when loading into any game. Then after, the game is just frozen so it's literally unplayable. Reinstalled and everything. Hoping for a fix soon."
"Just skip this and go right to DOOM Eternal. This game is objectively bad, Eternal does what it wanted to do way better, and the older doom games fit the style and game play way better. That's the tip of the iceberg.

1. DOOM, the foundation.

 2016 DOOM is a basically a re-skin of the old doom games, and they don't hide it. You'll find hidden rooms in ""reference"" to DOOM, but have you noticed the incredibly stale, closed off environments that are just part of the game? It looks to me they took the design philosophy of DOOM a little to serious. Like classic DOOM you'll be doing some backtracking for secrets and items, sometimes even for progression, in this game it's the same thing, but bigger (so worse). The reason it worked in the old games, Doomguy was fast, the levels we're tightly designed, and coded well too, of course. 2016 has NONE of that. It makes the formula, repetitive, stale, and anger inducing. Do you know how many time I've gotten stuck on slopes and railings? The inclusion of double jump nearly halfway through the game? DOG. The parts that are new they don't capitalize off of, cuz ""it's like old doom xd""

2. There's a better game waiting to be played.

 Y'all heard of DOOM ETERNAL? It's literally one of my favorite games. It has some problems but none as glaring as 2016. This will be my least touched upon point, you can read my Eternal review for more insight on what I think, TL:DR- fucking play ETERNAL.


3. Schizo screams in his room about the devs being stupid (general problems) 

There's a lot of bugs in this game. I run into 2 or 3 every level. Simple glitches like getting stuck on rails or getting soft locked (has happened 4 times now) is fine, but when it happens literally every fucking level it really starts to piss you off. Jumps not being made, ledges not being grabbed, glory kills not going off, fucking immediately going to a loading screen when you fall and die, being stuck on moving objects, lack of mobility (ik runes but tell me how far that runes is again...oh wait), bland color palette (browns, reds and blacks mostly). Honestly, these things again, aren't really to bad, it's like a 2% problem, but they literally made the perfect game after this one, so these problems are mega crippling, it's hard to for me to understand some of the choices made, but others are reasonable.


4. But Big Daddy, what was even the point?

Doom is great, I love doom. I'm really disappointed that I don't like this game, I played Eternal first and I'm glad I did, to me this game was just a stepping stone to get where we are now, another foundation for a great line of games coming. It's 2022 now, there's rumors of another DOOM coming, and I can give my thanks to this game for being the first, I can say that much about it.


24 hours of gameplay later review: I would still agree with the core of my arguments as to why this game is ""objectively bad"". Eternal is just such a massive upgrade to everything 2016 does. By no means is this game BAD, it is what it is. It's 3D DOOM, that's all it needed to be and the game is great because it sticks to that formula."
"This game doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It keeps encouraging me to push forward from combat to combat, but then reprimanding me for not spending time to search for secrets. Then there's light platforming and lore entries? What kind of game am I playing here? Is it a shooter, a platformer, or a secret hunting game? I can't figure it out because the game includes elements of all of them to the detriment of everything.
I know the original doom games had secrets, but from what I've seen of people playing those games, most of those secrets were found along the main path of the game, and they contained enemies as well as pick ups. In short, secrets in the original games provided more of the core content of the game. Here, secrets frequently contain collectibles, lore entries, or references to the original Doom without including any enemies. They interrupt the core game play loop of shooting and collecting supplies.
The arenas for fighting the monsters are well laid out, but the secrets are either very hard to find or just laying right out in the open. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground. Apparently the devs knew how to make combat maps, but their skill for the quiet connecting bits was lacking. If the secrets had been nicely tucked away between the combat arenas to allow a quick pallet cleanser, that would have been fine, but as it is they're just a distraction.
There's a couple issues with the movement. The light platforming is really weak and detracts from the game. Doom Guy will mantle onto things if you just miss the ledge, but only some ledges have this enabled without any indicator as to which is which. This leaves you falling to your death or landing in a pack of enemies, often interrupting an otherwise enjoyable combat encounter. What's worse is when you can clearly reach a ledge, but you arbitrarily can't mantle onto it because it's not the one true preordained path to the next area set out by the devs. The enemy hit boxes are also weirdly large, so they're easy to get stuck on when you're trying to maneuver in a tight combat. I can't count how many times I tried to run around an enemy only to hit an invisible wall sticking off of the side of it.
Lets talk about the pacing. There will be a great set piece fight and I'm having fun, but then I'm off hunting for dolls or doing rune challenges to unlock upgrades, totally killing the pacing. I tried to just ignore all the extra stuff and focus on the combat, but I found after a few levels I lacked the upgrades to carry enough health and ammo to deal with the increasing hordes of enemies. I went back and replayed levels to find secrets, again totally killing the pacing of the game, but now I can progress again. What happened to Rip and Tear until it is done? I'm spending half my play time finding dolls, taking computer chips from dead guys' armor, and breaking pokeballs found in huge treasure chests. Just give a cool vista to look at between big fights or a small room to restock and I'll be good. Giving me a chore list of things to find between combats really kills the mood.
Then there's the level challenges, all of which are somewhat arbitrary tasks you do in levels to upgrade your weapons. Why do these exist? Why are you interrupting the flow of the combat, which is well crafted, by asking me to do these weird specific tasks? When I was doing them, I wasn't playing the game anymore, I was analyzing the map to figure out where the Devs wanted me to do the task, because they can frequently only be reasonably completed in one part of the level where you can find the specific elements you need to complete the level challenge. On top of that, the challenges aren't usually connected to the theme of the level at all. Why do these exist? All they do is fuel the weapon upgrade system which is its own can of worms.
Speaking of which, let's talk about the weapon upgrade system. You have to use the collectibles you pick up in the levels to unlock mods for your guns. Then you use points from the various challenges to upgrade those mods. Why is this a thing? I'm playing a shooter, not an RPG. Make the mods rewards for defeating certain enemies for the first time or progressing through the campaign. Either make the mod upgrades included by default with the mod, or make them unlock by using the mod. As it is they often unlock by completing arbitrary tasks that don't even necessarily require using the gun, you just have to complete some random task while the mod is equipped and the weapon is in hand. I'm here to run around a shoot stuff, not analyse every combat for a chance to cheese out some mod unlock progress which is what I found myself consistently doing.
Then there's the runes, oh the runes. You have to find them in the aforementioned flow breaking secret areas. When you do find them, you have to play a little mini-game to unlock them. Yep, they literally teleport you out of the level and drop you in a separate level with a specific task required to use the rune. What the heck devs? I realize this is meant to be a little tutorial on how the rune works, but they almost always only have minor passive effects. There's no need for a tutorial on getting a passive boost to things I'm already doing. If you must include passive buffs like this, again I'm here to shoot things not play on RPG, just give them to me without the mini-tutorial. It's unnecessary and flow breaking for the game.

All in all, this is a solid game. The combat and the combat arenas are really well put together. Unfortunately, the whole thing is brought down by the inclusion of these weird secret hunt side missions, randomly included RPG elements, and arbitrary tasks that aren't related to the levels or weapons their tied to. I'm sure plenty of people will love the game despite these issues, but they were so flow breaking to an otherwise excellent game that I can no longer recommend it. Yes, I did beat the game on a mid-line difficulty. Yes, I went back and found all the secrets and unlocked all of the upgrades. If you're here for pure combat or expect your games to flow smoothly from one activity to the next, I recommend you look somewhere else.

[b]M y.   G o d.[/b]  This game is so unbelievably horny for glory kills.

I'm pretty sure the working title for this game was [i]""Project Glory Kills, Glory Kills, We LOVE Glory Kills: Aren't glory kills wonderful??""[/i]

When the devs sat down to brainstorm this game, they wrote the phrase ""Glory Kills"" on the dry erase board and all other gameplay ideas were required to branch out from there.

Several months into development, one audacious developer had the brazen nerve to suggest they put something in the game that's [i]not[/i] related to glory kills. He disappeared under mysterious circumstances and was never seen again.

The company gave gifts to the devs at each holiday, but the gift was always the same; a tiny statue of DoomGuy performing a glory kill on an imp. And every Saturday, the team would take a much needed break and go around the room, describing in detail which bodily orifice they stored their statue in during the week.

They love glory kills so much, they made the chainsaw into a glory kill gun. Then they gave the glory kill gun its own set of glory kill animations. Then they gave the glory kill gun its own dedicated button you can slam at any time. You know, just in case it's been longer than 3 seconds since the last time you've had a glory kill and you're getting the shakes.

They love glory kills so much, half of the runes you get for completing rune trials are solely for buffing your glory kills. And to complete some of those rune trials, you must perform a specific number of glory kills in a limited amount of time.

But wait. Just because you unlocked the rune doesn't mean you're done unlocking it. You still have tasks to finish to unlock it some more. And how do you further unlock the glory kill buffs you unlocked by performing glory kills in a glory kill challenge? Well with more glory kills, of course! Like getting 50 mid-air glory kills, getting 76 upside down glory kills, glory killing their left leg 100 times, glory killing their phone 256 times, glory killing their wife while she's on the toilet 9001 times. Then you unlock more glory kill and your glory kill becomes the most glory kill glory kill in the glory kill!

What? [b]You say you like glory kills?[/b] Well sure you do. How could you not? You're invincible while you're performing a glory kill. And you get health for performing them. And you get armor for performing them. And you get ammo for performing them. And you get upgrades. And you get achievements. And you get Bethesda Store points. And Bethesda Store coupons. And personal ball massages. And Todd Howard kisses. And you get to inseminate Todd Howard's daughters. Glory kills are so great, they have to endlessly bribe you to use them! That's how you know they're great!

I'm surprised they don't give this game out for free, on the sole condition the user must perform a glory kill at least once for every minute played.

And I just now realized something. Remember how some of those doors are stuck and require DoomGuy to force it open, via a little first person animation? I've realized that animation is DoomGuy performing a glory kill on the door.

That's how much they love glory kills. You no longer open doors. [b]You glory kill them open![/b]

[h1]Wuts:[/h1]
What did they do to Pinky?? Look how they massacred my boy! He's invincible from the front? His only attack is a charge attack? Then you dodge and hit him from behind? Didn't that trope burn itself out around 2005? What is this shit??

Why did DoomGuy throw the monitor to the floor at the beginning? It was like the devs were agreeing unskippable story in games is boring, breaks flow, and gets in the way of all of the fun shooting. But then they put a long boring story right back in the game, anyways. So which is it, guys?

Why does everybody say the super shotgun is great? Yes, it plays a nice WAV file every time you mouse click, but what does it offer besides that? The spread and damage will always be underwhelming so long as this single player game feels like it has network lag and the enemies aren't taking damage. And the reload time is what seals its fate. I would much rather be using the rocket launcher, the railgun, the chaingun, the plasmagun, hell even the single barrel shotgun has a grenade launcher as the alt fire. What's the super shotgun's alt fire? Iron sights. [b]I r o n.   S i g h t s.[/b]

What's with the aesthetics of this game? Did nobody on the dev team have an objection to this? Everything is ugly, shiny, and moving. I can't tell if something is a demon or a coffee maker. I understand the idea is to make you feel like you're inside of a living, breathing world, something significantly bigger than yourself, like you're a single cell bacteria deep inside the writhing bowels of a komodo dragon. But it breaks the flow when I constantly have to stop and ponder if the haze of shiny brown pixels in the distance is something I need to shoot or not. [b]In short; don't make the enemies and the environment look the same.[/b]

Why is this game's install size so big? What could possibly be taking up that much space? It's not like there's a lot of variety to the levels. Every level in the game is a sciencey place, a sandy place, or a sciencey place with sand blowing into it. Is this an anti-piracy practice? If so, I guess it would work. Who would want to download 70gbs, only for it to not install properly, which would force them to find another 70gbs download? Which brings me to...

[h1]68.69 GB:[/h1]
Every time I see this game in my library, I breathe the weary sigh of the subjugated.

The only reason I have to play this is so I can finally beat it and consider myself done with it. Only then can I uninstall it from my NVMe once and for all, get my 70gbs of space back, and never have another reason to redownload it.

But now that's no longer enough.

The game is just SO boring. It's soul crushing. The combat is easily the best part and creates truly fun moments, and in those moments I can all too briefly only glimpse at what others see in this game. But there is too much space in between those moments. The game feels like a grind. It's a chore I must accomplish, not because I benefit from it, but only so I can consider the chore finished.

Now I don't even want to beat it. I wouldn't feel good, accomplished, or joyful. I would only breathe another weary sigh of the subjugated. It would be over, sure. But beating it wouldn't be a victory, it would be a release.

I understand Agent Smith now. He doesn't want to destroy the humans because he hates them. He wants to destroy them so he can finally not have a purpose and thus be freed from his own miserable existence. His being and goal mirrors their own; he is a slave and he wants to be free. With them out of the way, his suffering could finally end and he could at long last be mercifully deleted. The demons are my Morpheus.

But I differ from him in one way; I have a choice.

I choose to release myself. Uninstalled."

cool and all but its not 100% BFG division and the gameplay is too slow just like my uncle who fell down the stairs

"Won't start, Gives error report."
Too many long term players that only play this game and it ruins it for everyone. There is no anticheat so its a free for all as far as hacks. Who knows whats out there.
A positive review is not available in your region.
as a mother of 3 DONT let your kids play this game it is very violent and crude.
game with 1000+ bugs

"spend more time wondering where to go than you do shooting baddies, i got my 5 dollars worth,uninstall"
"Overwhelmingly bland gameplay, enemies barely react to hits, weapons feel like nerf guns.

Jumping and general movement doesn't feel fluid, but stiff and designed for consoles. Platforming is no fun at all.

Story is laughable even for doom

Music is 10/10 tho."
"DOOM Review 5/10/2022

To Hell and Back and Back Again

CONS -
It only took me less than 10 hours to beat single player mode. The last third was a wave after wave of the same thing. The guns they give you are fun, but half of them become worthless at the end of the game- meaning ammo is scarce for the weapons you do need. I played the game on ""Hurt me Plenty"" difficulty which I guess is the ""Normal"" setting. For sure the game was meant to be played on harder difficulties. Seems online mode is dead, and the matches i did get in (I just frankly suck) it felt like the gun balancing wasn't fair. I'd like to try the mode where you become a demon but I could never get into a lobby. (Maybe everyone is playing DOOM Eternal now). The games story is...basic? Does it need to be some masterpiece? No. But the whole premise is ""You shoot demons because they exist...and...thats it"". Of course there are background characters and lore within the game to collect. But none of that is front and center. Which means the player has less reason to care for ""Doom guy"" or the bad guys or even your few allies. Because they have very little depth. I want to know about the DOOM lore and worlds I'm travelling more. Especially when they put so much effort into the visuals and soundtrack of this game.

PROS-
(Spoilers)
YOU GET TO GO TO HELL AND BACK-  AND THEN BACK AGAIN!!! WHILE LISTENING TO METAL!!! And fight on Mars!!! How cool is that for a setting??? 
The saving grace of this game is its movement and runes (abilities). Charging across the map to rip open a demons head which in turn gave me health and armor encouraged me to rapidly charge right at their faces with the shotgun. The gore is fantastic and satisfying. I like how this game rewards you for exploring and there are very cool secret rooms which pay tribute to the original game's release back in the 90s. I can't say I loved the boss fights but they were pleasing to fight. On ""hurt me plenty"" it took a couple deaths but I finished the job. I would wanna replay the game on a harder difficulty to REALLY feel scared when they show up. 

SIDE NOTE: The Beserk powerup is fantastic, one punch-one kill on literally any minion is the best way to play DOOM.

Verdict-
6.5/10
DOOM is a sugar rush, a short one at that- but a delightful treat while you slay demons on the high. I found myself getting tired by the end of the single player. I wanted it to end. The sugar wore off and I was looking for another kick at the end to keep me going. I can't imagine how much time it took to design these levels and animate the monsters. But after the 10 hours of repeating soundtrack you start to see where they cut corners and just ""copy-pasted"" similar fights from other levels onto the last remaining arenas."
Progress blocking bug a couple of missions in. I died and when it reloaded it had a checkpoint that I had already progressed past and I am just unable to continue past it at all now.
B U G S
IT DOESNT LOAD  PROPERLY .
"Pretty game, but extremely repetitive. Too boring for me as it could not hold my interest."
"The gameplay is ok, but only for the reason that I had to use devmode and god mode to get pass a boss, the gamefile got corrupted, with no chance of recovery, so i had to start a new game. that made me just uninstall the game and rethink my earlier respect for ID."
"game runs like shit, i turned all the graphics down to nothing and have a good pc and i cant play at all, cyberpunk ran better than this"
i want my money and my time back
If you love trying to land jumps in a first-person shooter this is the game for you!
The lack of save game functionality outside of garbage console checkpoints really mars an otherwise fun experience.
boring as shit
I can't get over the mechanic of going into a full animation and killing an enemy.  As an older FPS player I find this terrible enough to not even bother playing through the game.  Game is just too boring!
corrupted my save file
"Edit: Marty Stratton, Bethesda, and Bethesda Legal are complicit in abusive, manipulative, and slanderous behavior against Mick Gordon, warranting a total boycott of ALL Bethesda titles from here on until this situation is rectified and Marty is out of a job.


Better than Doom Eternal in my opinion. Gauss Cannon Siege mode is the best videogame weapon, fight me."
not working
"Didn't finish the game, because the cutscenes are unskippable and dumb. Also, I was always low on ammo, no matter the difficulty mode."
"Too much violence such as blood and gore, I threw up playing this game. 0/10!"
0/10 not Quake 1.
"Quake 3 gameplay with juvenile violence and nothing interesting to add. I can remember playing Doom 3, and going around staring at walls in hell, to look at the art they'd done. The way the enemies moved was so creepy, and the increasingly visceral (literally) settings gave it all so much to get involved in. Even Doom (1993) had all sorts of lush art to look at, from the stretchy faces and tentacles, to the green marble and the Giger-esque end-of level doors. In contrast, I once backtracked an entire level of Doom (2016), finding every secret, because I didn't notice the end-of-level button. It's 20 hours of grey lumps."
"Horrible. After hours of troubleshooting trying to get the game to work using the lowest settings and capping the frame rate I got past the first mission once, and can't do anything again without freezing or crashing. Most of the time I can't even get into the main menu. I'm past the refund date or I would. I thought I'd enjoy this quite a bit given how much praise It's gotten, but I can't enjoy something I can't play.

(Finally gotten it to work after a lot more tinkering and it's amazing how badly optimized this is, several options need to be set perfectly like if the api should be OpenGL 4.5 or Vulkan and if you don't get it right then nothing works)(I know Bethesda only published it, and didn't code it, but it really has that Bethesda ""polish"")(Now that it's working perfectly fine and stable I gotta think about how good the game is and in short it's mostly good but it's not exactly revolutionary or anything. It's enjoyable and finding ""most"" of the secrets is good and feels rewarding.)"
"can not open the game
""the engine has crashed""

need help"
"Single player is fun but can get mentally taxing after a while.

Multiplayer is very meh and feels unnecessary.

Not fond of the spastic twitch shooter trend these last 2 DOOM titles are going down.

Prefer older titles using GZDoom/Zandronum source ports for better multiplayer modes and mods.

Badass soundtrack though!"
Not for someone that doesn't like long boring firefights.
sorry this game diarrhea
"cant figure way forward, few hours running to walls and deleting forever 0/5"
not fun
"Looks better than it feels.
Maby if you played all games before and have some nostalgy about it bur for a newby its just a plane run and jump simulator with no catching Storry or anything i hoed for,"
"This game was a boring ass slog. Tedious gameplay, slow as shit movement options

Took me a year to finish this damn game on and off because of how much of a snoozefest it was

Don't buy this."
"Price I paid: $5

I really wanted to like this game, but it's just not satisfying to me.

In the original DOOM, you could turn imps and zombies into dog food with one satisfying shotgun blast from 20 feet away, followed by that equally satisfying pump-action sound effect. It's gameplay that stands the test of time and never gets old!

Now you gotta get point-blank if you want to kill the weakest enemies with a single shotgun blast and you don't even want to do that! - what you're supposed to do is stun them (so be close, but not too close) then while they're staggered you ""glory kill"" (hit F to initiate a fancy fatality animation) the monsters. It's fun for like 2 minutes, then it just becomes redundant.

On top of that, there are RPG mechanics that I really don't like. Throughout the levels, you find little robots that upgrade your gear. I ended up with a shotgun that can shoot grenades... which is dumb! Why not give me a grenade/rocket launcher like in Quake instead? I suppose it would have been worse if I missed the upgrade entirely! Imagine a shooter where you could miss half your arsenal? Doesn't seem fun or smart, if you ask me.

Worse than having to perform fatalities every 5 seconds to get my health back are the cutscenes and the dialogue. I. Do. Not. Care! I just want to run around and blast zombies. Oh, and speaking of just running around, why does my guy have to rip every door open like he's the hulk? Save me 10 seconds and just have the doors open up and let me walk through them - it's not cool or fun, it's just repetitive!

Complaints aside, the graphics are great and the action is smooth - albeit kinda boring. I feel like they were trying too hard to be edgy and innovative. 

TLDR: Worth the $5 but it's just ""meh."" I suggest getting BRUTAL DOOM instead - which is way more fun and free!"
This has more in common with mario than Doom 1/2/64. This is NOT Doom. The Doom series is truly dead. This is closer to Mario than Doom since you play as Sir hopsalot instead of focusing on the shooting.
Eh.  Pretty mediocre.
BUGGY
"Great graphics and sound, but the game severely outstays its welcome and becomes a fucking bore halfway through. No one wants to fight the same lame bullet sponge enemies over and over again."
#GAMES OUT OF POLITICS!!!!!
i hate doom sooooo much
"I'm too impatient to search my way through the levels of the campaign. I feel like Dora the Explorer 90% of the time, alternated with 10% John Wick. 
Personal preference though, otherwise the game runs very well and the combat is great ^^"
f this game
"I played most Doom older games for fun. Until Doom 3, I found it not appealing to me. Now with this, the same thing happened!

I started the game and got afraid of dying, frustrated from dying, I went into rage, then I started hunting the fucking demons of hell. It never stops! My adrenaline is high, I can't sleep at night because I feel like I have to play and kill some fucking demons. I never had a grudge on such game monsters before. I am only quitting now because it started to affect my health.

If you like a game where you go and KILL SOME DEMONS, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS SHIT!!

Too bad, I can't recommend it. I wish I could go back and play Gears of War for the first time again instead of this."
i was in the dark it was so dark i cant see
"I love this game, it was a real blast. Everything was awesome, guns, gamplay, music, etc. Right until my save game corrupted and I lost my near complete save game. Absolute bullshit."
meh
It's a boring and shallow shooter.
just meh
R.I.P Multiplayer
"I've been playing this for 3 hrs, I've run into a game breaking bug, every time I screen shot everything goes black, my screen becomes pitch black. There were times were when I continue my game on the last checkpoint the game spawns me in an area that is no longer part of the area that I am suppose to be in, and the gates to get to the area im supposed to be on does not open because it thinks I am still in that area despite not being there. I hope this gets fixed soon (Which is unlikely).

Game Crashed and corrupted the save file."
"This game is overwhelmingly loved by many and I absolutely understand why.  It's intense, fast-paced, hardhitting, plays amazing, and is spectacular.

For me, it's so fast paced and chaotic thaqt I found myself not strategizing or playing smart and instead running and gunning without thought.  Many people enjoy that gameplay but for me I prefer to outsmart my enemies.

If you think you'd like reckless abandon and running and gunning, you will like this game."
"Do you know that one badas scene from the intro where 2016 doom guy shows off his attitude?
Yea the game is the exact opposite of that. I got this around christmas 2021 at ~5 bucks and it still feels like wasted money.

Everything is designed around you doing exactly what the designers thought of, gauntlet after gauntlet, level after level, and its at best as good as the quality of the ideas and their execution which drops very fast after the initial level. Interested in coming up with your own strategies or wanting to experiment? Better try a different game from a different developer. I suggest one thats is not in the grasp of Zenimax and a mob of bethesda companies. Reading the credits for this hints at a rather bizarre production history as a small army scattered over half the globe seems to have worked on this product with what reads like hundreds of producers and managers ..
Where all that work went is a mystery to me whereas the environmental art deserves praise in many instances.

I also have to wonder how one can look at a franchise like Doom and think it wise to ""enrich"" the once working concept with mediocre storytelling, especially when that story seems to take itself way too serious and isnt well written on any level.

Last but not least there is the anti cheat story one can read about in many other reviews - trash behaviour of people that seem to consider their audience helpless clueless fools. How that did not have more serious consequences is a mystery to me.

rip ID software,
please go away zenimax,
back to indie games."
"I cannot recommend this game at all, too late for a refund soo might as well finish but here's why I hate it, the controls are terrible like the doom guy walks around like he's holding in a shit he even jumps like that too, the music gets really annoying and the tune trails make no sense, sometimes you get a good weapon other times a shitty one, I got this on offer and I'm glad cause full price for game with a lot flaws yeah no, will be avoiding ID and doom which when you think about it ID is like short for idiots soo yeah idiots made this game"
"The game is great during the 5% of time it actually works. My computer is more than good enough to run it based on the specs listed, but this game still crashes every hour or so, and my save file has been lost more times than I can count in only 15 hours of gameplay. I'd love to be able to complete this game, but I'm stuck replaying the first few levels because of how buggy and easy to lose it is. Could have been great."
"if I wanted to (double) hop like a rabbit I would just play Jazz jackrabbit.
Too much hopping, too much wannabe cinematic nonsense and a really annoying enemy in the shape of the Hell Guard.

That fight was stupid as is the boss.

Also, Steam, why the hell does the game break when I enable dev mode and the steam client is working?
I don't care about stupid nonsense like achievements, I am here to unwind, and all this nonsense is just annoying me, the game screams the save is corrupted, but Steam offline works just fine.

This is shit!"
"This game started out strong. Very strong. Then by level 5 I was just speed running and didn't a fuck about all of the extra secrets and collectables which were a cheap way of ensuring that they got you playing for more hours. Endless hordes of the same 6 boring enemies, with only ONE weapon that is actually effective (super shotgun). In summary, the game has really good mechanics that are reminiscent of the classic DOOM games. But the game falls short in terms of longevity. It gets very boring and by the end of it you just want to get the bloody thing over with."
Never ever play this after DOOM Eternal or you will keep dying because of your own grenade or falling into holes during combat
Lack of movement makes this game not feel as enjoyable as it could be.
this is the game your annoying cousin tells you to play because its so epic and not corrupted by those ess jay double yous. you shoot some demons and some of the demons require more bullets to kill than the other demons. your cousin only listens to rock music and thinks the soundtrack is a masterwork by god himself. strip back all the hype around this game and its a repetitive shooter with some good visual design that you can safely skip and not feel bad about in the slightest.
constantly pulls you out of the action for some boring story.
"Litterally unplayable, unfinishable eveen."
it gets stuck at 99 percent and wont load
"Unstable game, constant random crashes, not playable.  Have encountered the issues on both Intel and AMD based systems with GTX 3060 or RX 6600 GPU's. Windows or Linux, same problems.  Had crashing issues on my old Dell XPS with a GTX 1050 over a year ago.  Got new systems and same issues. 

Strongly do not recommend this game due to lack of usable updates that can resolve the constant crashing issues."
"Hero is too fragile.
The mission objectives and waypoints are not indicated on the maps.
Will finish and uninstall forever."
"I can't go back to this after playing Eternal. Not a bad game, but a hard sell compared to its sequel."
More like Dumb
surprisingly boring

"Could had been a good game on past, but all my played time was spent trying to start the dam thing, no matter how much Launch options I set up (+ r_renderAPI -1, 0 or even 1), set both .exe for win 7 and admin, got VCs x64 and 32 updated, installed Vulkan on purpose, and stil no sucess, forum is full with ppl on same issues, even the dev ""solution"" is wrongly typed, this is pointless"
"It's a good game, but as an old-school Doom (1993) player, I don't think it's for me:

- Instead of always moving forwards, you are locked into small arenas where enemies constantly spawn, until some unknown threshold is reached.
- ""Glory kills"" are excessively gory."
"Someone's mediocre idea for an original FPS, shoehorned into doom, possibly the single least appropriate franchise vehicle for it imaginable. Who remembers Doom, kids? The game where you do loads of melee animations and have to be careful not to shoot too much or hurt any of the enemies too bad? That's the one.

Before: ripping through maps at lightning speed
Now: loads of samey sealed off kill rooms 
Before: lots of contextual audio clues for enemies, all of which are distinct behaviourally and can be easily provoked to shoot each other for more mayhem
Now: pretty much everything warps in immediately around you with zero announcement, pretty much anything that shoots does so at low volume, pretty fast speed and pretty accurately
Before: shooting enemies dead to emphasise multi-kills and prioritising groups, enemy HP, range, etc, using the appropriate weapon
Now: shooting enemies dead deprives you of i-frames and HP, and you're constantly locked in tiny rooms with no range shooting possible

The combination of constantly being sealed off in a tiny room with teleporting enemies, and being punished for overkilling/exceeding HP limits by losing your i-frame executions and HP, means the game is basically a series of start-stops, punctuated by even more annoying canned mini stops for executions. The pace of the game is basically that of the equally mediocre Doom 3, without any of the more interesting tools the expansion pack added. 

Genuinely, incredibly suspicious of the tastes of anyone who rates this as good."
Not Enough Gore/Violence 10/10
i just wanna kill demons and not search the map for 4 different kind of collectibles (3 of which influence gameplay)
It is annoying that the only way to disable this constant irritating prompt is to actually review the game. So I will: IT SUCKS!
the saved game protection sucks
i cant play the game
Trash
doom is not boom
"I had to reset two different levels in an advanced stage and I'm not even sure if they bugged out or the level design was just terrible. Anyway, if I wanted to be stuck by bullshit, I would replay the Ocarina of Time water temple. Fuck it."
"Doom sucks 
1 Weapons suck on here there similar to the ones on Destiny 2 but worse on Doom then they are on Destiny 2
2 The fighting style on here sucks it's not worth the time. I would rather play Destiny 2 over Doom any time.
3 Doom is a waste of money on this game as well.

Doom is not a game I play as my very first Fps game. I would suggest Destiny 2 or halo or other fps games as your First Fps game instead of Doom. Each mission one by one is slower then what other Fps games and Destiny 2 are.
Destiny 2 may seem slower just cause they are longer, They are Definitely not as slow a paste per mission as missions on Doom.

Weapons on here suck really bad and they don't shoot that well either They fire as slow as they can possible go on Doom. You also don't get ammo for them as easily, They also don't look as cool either and you don't get a big verity on witch ones you want to keep and use at a time. On Doom you get certain ones and stuck with them that sounds horrible If your a Destiny 2 fan Like halo has the same thing but the only Difference with it in Halo from Doom is you get to pick up new weapons on Halo and some times repeats, In Doom you don't even get to do that and put shaders on any of your weapons like customize them and make them look cooler same with halo.

After checking out and playing doom over time periods and now to find out it's a slow game and not very fun is not a very good game. I get that each Fps game has there own style and versions of each game that they like to do but some seem like they are worse then others and it happens some times. 

Doom is a paid similar version of destiny 2 with just missions, blood gore graphics, horror.
Now if you enjoy horror games then you might not find this game so terrible cause of Doom having horror related content.
I have played this game a bunch my self never really paid attention to certain parts of the game but now in days the more games I play and just went back to trying it out today and thinking about playing this I was like nope.
I also got into this game cause I was trying to want to handle horror did not bother me at all till I got use to it way back in the day but now in days that I been playing certain Fps games more I am more aware of content in games as far as horror and not horror in Fps games Depending on what the game is.

Doom is definitely not a Faster paste it's more of a slower fps game with combat the only part that is fast about this game is how quickly your player moves other wise it's like as slow as combat can go on here.
Doom is also not worth $20.00 for this game, Some were around $5-10 in that price range is more worth it for any of the newer Doom Games out there on Steam. 

I would suggest If your a destiny 2 fan avoid this game unless you like Horror related content in Video games and including fps games But I am personally would not play this game any more cause I don't like horror content in video games and Doom Sucks as a Fps game as well.
I also would suggest not spending money on Doom as well not even worth 1 cent so just save the money unless you are a horror fan.

Now if your not A Destiny 2 Fan you might enjoy this game cause your not use to the Content paste of Destiny 2 one dlc at a time and doing the grinding for loot. 
There is a lot more to do on Destiny 2 then Doom as far as I know from playing Doom from the time I played the game and Playing Destiny 2 Doom is not gonna be no were as much fun as Destiny 2 and other fps games that for sure in my opinion.

This game is just more the Blood and Gore fans who are looking for something similar to Destiny 2 but with more Blood Gore and horror related content added to it. So if you like that then this game is for you if not I would not suggest it once."
It's kinda boring.
does not work properly crashes every 10-15 mins into the game
"Awful checkpoint only save system that merely exists to pad game length; menu system that's designed to be used with controller; adopts worst part of original Doom, running around in circles on a map looking for keycards; freezes frequently. Terrible game all around."
"I just got stuck, not knowing where to go, trapped in a furnace type place. Not enough help given showing you where to go. Frustrated. Yes I'm not a very good player but that's not the point."
"Boring, completely uncaptivating story if there's any. Basically just attracts Gore and obnouxious music players.
Even for 5 dollars, very regretful purchase."
Activating console disables saves. I am a grown ass adult with no time for the intended method of play. This is rude. I care not about achievements. Just want to play through the campaign in a reasonably fast pace. Simple as that. I don't care about cheat haters. They do not work enough to judge me.
I piss and shit and cum my pant
"I played this game to the end once. 
So. I like the idea of a mindless shooter with a linear map and with skipable story and uncomplainable graphics.
To my flavor, there could be fewer weapons and straighter explanations what to kill with what. That's because this was my first doom, and only after I played the Eternal, which gives clear instructions in weak points and weapon weaknesses of monsters. (the Eternal had another bug, namely that shadow maps are many individual dots (which looks horrible)).

On second play-on, the bummer for me was the very bad map. I simply often don't know where the fork I have to go. And that gets pretty annoying because 1) every room looks roughly the same; I mean, the game is supposed to be that way because there is no story and hence the room where something happens is irrelevant. 2) Games like these are played for the purpose of being relieved of thinking for the time playing.

The issue with the map is that it is 3D and there are many storeys. You have to rotate the map and it does not show you doors nor does it indicate where you have to go. After several back and forth and serching in certain ""levels"" and then going to youtube and searching trough various videos where the point would be where they make progress from the point that I am at, I just entirely lost the fun.

I wish it had just be a game where you have like 3 to 4 guns and bash through enemies with a lot of blood and splatter. But that is not the case because of the confusing map and because of the complicated enemy mechanics (weapon resistency, weak points, etc)."
"basically a game for idiots. literally all u do is kill people. hello? 2003 wants their killing game back? nowadays games should have more of a reason for all the senseless killing. doom-man should break into tears every time a demon's life is extinguished by his bloodied hands.

instead of this game you should play ""Shenmue 3"". the follow up to the critically acclaimed ""Shenmue 2""."
hate it
I PLAYED BEFORE DOOM ETERNAL AND I VERY LIKED THIS GAME AND I FINISH THE CAMPIAGN 2 TIMES AND THAT'S MAKE THIS GAME MORE BORING LITRELI
"I waited many years to play this one, and my expectations were admittedly high. Sadly, they were not met, at all. The game is much slower than expected, the level design is a mess, and consists of finding your way to the next ""arena"" by using an unclear map and a destination pointer. When you find it, you're locked in until everything is dead. Then repeat, forever. While the music is amazing, it's often not there at all, and the sound design was a huge miss for me. The first 4 weapons all felt underwhelming, even after a few upgrades.

The ""glory kill"" system was always presented as non intrusive and ""flowing perfectly"" with the combat, but that also never really worked as expected, it creates so many unnecessary pauses, and sometimes break the flow of combat by making you unsure about where your character is actually positioned.

Also, the title screen still shows advertising to preorder stuff released 2 years ago. The overall menus were a bit of a mess too, took some time just to find where the settings were, and then even longer to find out how to set resolution to ultrawide. I'd expect games to detect and set that automatically nowadays instead of making you waste a long time in menus just to set the game resolution to match your monitor."
"This game is super boring compared to doom eternal. 
The level design is pretty terrible with it's massive ass 20 stories facilities where if you want to explore or even want to go to the objective you will get lost lots of times since the layouts are very shit and the radar doesn't properly show where you have to go. 
This is especially shit when you have just killed lots of demons, you are excited to run super quickly to another location and continue the massacre, but instead you just get this massive tempo slowdown which is pretty detrimental to the overall fun aspect.

Verdict: Buy doom eternal instead!"
there's a rocket launcher in the game but you can't rocket jump so overall 0/10 unplayable
Dont know how you feck up this game but they did.................
STUPID GAY DUMB SHITTY RIPOFF OF HALO THIS GAME IS FOR BABYHEADS WITH THEIR GAY LITTLE MONSTERHEADS MASTERBATING CHEF COULD BEATUP THIS HALO WANABES ASS ANYDAY >:DDDDD DOOMS FOR VIRIGIN IDIETHEADS HAHAHAHA
6/10.
its not as good as doom eternal
"Game crashes constantly without errors, doesn't matter what I change in the settings, it's just unplayable for me."
fix the save thing
"poop - no co-op, multiplayer is down 90+% of the time.  just don't even..."
"I wanted to return and play it, but the the game is broken due to updates? Until they fix the game I leave negative comment that other ppl be aware."
If you like scary games this one is for you. Unless you like being scared to death I would give it a miss.
"I'm trying to say something nice about this sequel of a classic.

but it's very slow compared to the original.
the graphics are very good, but there seems to be nothing truly horrifying here, just repetitive slaying of monster tryhards.

it's just not worthy of the title ""doom"" if it doesn't portray that feeling one bit.

goodbye gordon (minigame) is scarier than this. sorry id"
"Dont tag the shit as co-op if its not.

0/11"
I JUST HATE IT ive beat it twice on ps4 and played so much i dont know why i hatew it so much the seacrits are manditory you need a walkthourugh its worse than final fantasy and the game is so jank and unsatifying but i played it for 40 hours and so i guess it did somthing right
bit overated gets rlly repetative only played 45 mins of the game and started getting bored probably going to refund
"I bought the game.
Got 4 hours of gameplay out of it...
Tried to start it up today for an evening demon slaying session and the game refused to load (Not Responding in Task Manager). The DOOM Console talked about some dev_mode and ""unverified resources in the game files""

At least I got it on sale so I'm not out a lot of money..."
boring game
Really want doom eternal soundtrack on spotify.
Boring.
"the game is not bad in itself, it's just unfinished and boring. There are few enemies, and they are not very dangerous. The game begins to be played only towards the end."
"It was good when it came out, but the level design is abysmal mazes of backtracking"
Too many puzzle and story elements... I just wanna shoot some dudes and rip some apart :/
"A good game, tho runs shit with AMD... Vulkan makes it bearable, but still experience some crashes"
"Save game corrupt and apparently thats a thing in the doom forums (just google it) , its effecting everyone, its also effecting doom eternal.have to play back from the start but whose to say this wont happen again , so cant recommend for now and will be skipping doom eternal as well. Why would a save game have so many files ? and no restoring from steam cloud save game didnt work either. you can download someone else save game but it will be in dev mode and achievements will be locked. the campaign can be finished in 9 hours or less."
"Graphics are great, but it's meh at best if you ask me. And yes I come from Doom 95 days, lol. This is just not for me I guess."
"not bad i guess,  nothing fantastic; but running around looking for keys with the shitty map system and no waypoint markers is an exercise in frustration"
"The game crashed, the save file then corrupted and I can't access my save file anymore. Actual bullshit. There's a steam cloud for this exact reason. The game was fun, but this sucks."
"Don't play this if you have already played eternal, its a stuttery un-optimised piece of shit. The game play and story is good but the constant lag spikes are unbearable"
trash
"The game was good and different from the usual fps games i played for about 3 hours. After that i almost got sick of this repetition.

Its the same thing and it never ends. I played for 9 hours now. Not even close to finish it. 
If it was like 5 hours long i would've definitely putted a thumbs up. But it just got super boring. I can't stand it anymore."
audio doesnt work
I doesn't have an easy enough setting. I got half way through and then got stuck at one of the bosses.  I couldn't finish the game. That totally sucked.
"I finally got around to playing this game after buying some Collector's Edition with the Revenant Statue. Despite the Revenant Statue itself having been in poor quality (was quite literally broken when I got it), I enjoyed the game's campaign greatly. I am very saddened that I'll never be able to 100% the game however as I absolutely hate and avoid multiplayer in shooter games like this and thus will never get the achievements outside the single-player campaign. I honestly wish games like this would stop putting in multiplayer achievements but sadly that seems to be a pipe dream as clearly game companies don't care when it comes down to it.

Would I recommend this game? Honestly no, because it'll forever bother me that I can't 100% the game. However if you enjoy multiplayer, then have at it, I won't stop you."
Game just plain sucks!!!! Major snooze fest. dont waste your money. One of the worse remakes ever played
I couldnt start the game. crashed before i can even see the main menu
"It's like EVERYBODY claims that if u r looking for an EXCITING shooter game, then DOOM it is.
Well, thb, I quit the game after like 2 hrs. The game is just not what I expected it to be.
Firstly, I gotta run around the maps to find these goddamned ammo so that I can shoot a 20-shots-capped-reload-free-shotgun.
Secondly, the HUD and guiding system suck! I had to spend the most time finding the path to the next interactive point AND it was under the circumstance of all those soooo well-hidden key items collected.
Finally, I kept the precious 3 grenades from the beginning to the end coz tutorial never showed which button it was.
No offense but this shit is not for me."
no
Ништа специјално. И даље мислим да су бољи претходни делови.
There's a glitch making the mouse fly all over the place making this game unplayable.
"Started haven't got around to finishing it, the gameplays ok!"
Starts fun but holding D and left click gets boring after a little while
"Can't really go for something that doesn't allow turning off aim assist.  I can't shoot around shields, because they didn't want me to have the option?  I was going to write that Todd Howard was nowhere to be seen in this game, but there he is after all.  I've died more times to the security shield guys than to anybody else, because my brain can't accept the fact that I can't shoot where I want to.

You get better value out of Wolfenstein (the 2 good ones) and Dead Space."
im slaying heretics in doom
poop and shit until you cum
Often mind-bogglingly boring as you try to find the hidden door for an hour or two. I have given upon this game several times because of this.
Double the movement speed and maybe I'll like it
"I just dont like it, while i enjoyed the old Doom in the 90s; this just sucks. 
Boomer shooters and scifi just dont work in modern graphics and mechanics for me. 
Extremely overrated."
I can't play this game normally as the game is freezing on main page while loading(((
"the difficulty mode is the worst part, first time playthu normal is too easy on hard it's BS, thanks to the checkpoint that make you go though the same mob, they either hit too hard or take too much damage. 
what's wrong with a manual save? 
didn't think I would like this game thu, nothing really new and excited at this point.
it's NOT a must play, I mean you kite large dude around and GK imps, that's the game play
also input every direction move so the AI can't hit you."
"was immediately bored to death by this game. the opening cut scene was cool, and then it was all downhill from there. too many scripted events, glory kills make it too easy, and it's not nearly fast paced enough. there's way too much space between enemies. and a pistol with infinite ammo? yikes. i guess it might be an OK game, but it's a trash doom game."
👎
"DOOM is a ""reboot"" of the original id Software DooM from 1993, the game that made FPS the institution it is today, being the first multiplayer FPS game, and a few other industry firsts as well.  2016's DOOM is as much a follow on from DOOM 3 as it is a reboot of the franchise.    This edition of the game is a solid, story driven, gory, horror themed FPS with light platforming elements.

Many things have been done exceedingly well here.   The graphics are immaculate, the game is highly polished.  FPS action is tight, immersive and engaging.   The game features numerous progression areas including upgrading your weapons, armour, core stats, and special bonuses from ""Runes"", which are difficult skill challenges.   The game is full of hidden areas, secrets and unlocks to find.  For 2016 it can be argued this was the best of breed action FPS. 

I'd like to be able to recommend this, I really would.  But there's some problems that have impacted a few players to the point they gave up on the game (indeed, only about 1/3rd of people who own the game bothered to finish it).   It's something id/Bethesda know about but haven't bothered to fix.   For myself, and for many other players (just read the discussions and internet forums about the problem!) the game freezes up momentarily.  Not once or twice, mind you... every 8 seconds.   The game pauses for about 0.5 to 1 second.  This might not seem like a lot, but it's enough to make you pull your hair out.  It's like water torture.  You'll die to enemies, you'll miss making a jump, all because that 8 second timer comes around and freezes you right when you're in the middle of the action.  Over, and over, and over again. 

I've tried everything to fix it.  Switching between OpenGL and Vulkan, disabling Razer Chroma, every single graphics tweak there is, different graphics drivers, re-installing the game completely, wiping profiles and shader caches... there's simply no user-side fix to the problem.   id's Tech engines are considered the best in the industry, so it's bewildering and disappointing that they shipped the game with such serious glitches, and worse that they never bothered to fix them. 
 
Maybe you won't suffer the same problems, maybe the game will be perfect for you.  It wasn't for me, it wasn't for others, and because of that, I just can't tell people to buy this game."
doomguy isnt thicc and its halo
It's boring for me. Not my type of game.
"Cool, but unplayable, too many crashes, audio lags, fps drops, and blackscreens

i really wanted to play this, but, you know, Bethesda happens"
"Just meh, don't even know if its worth $5"
"Unplayable trash. The audio mixing is so bad that it makes the game unplayable--if you disagree, it's because you play the game for the soundtrack, try turning it off, whoever did the technical audio on this game (and DOOM Eternal, which has the same issues) should be fired and never work in the industry again.

P.S.
Upon further consideration, I think the proper punishment for whoever did the sound mixing is to be forced to work on EA mobile games for eternity."
"Disclaimer: This review is written after my first ever playthrough of Doom 2016, and obviously I was playing on Ultra-Violence, because I played Doom 1 & 2, Ultimate Doom and Plutonia Experiment on Ultra-Violence.
[hr][/hr]
[h1]What I liked[/h1]
[b][u]Increased mobility[/u][/b]. I am a Quake Live veteran and I absolutely love when a shooter game is [i]fast[/i] and requires you to pay attention to surroundings, and Doom 2016 delivers here. The shootouts reminded me of Quake Live multiplayer fights, and I really liked that enemies are not just rushing mindlessly at you, but actually try to surround you and approach you from unexpected directions. 
[b][u]Agile monsters[/u][/b]. Comparing to enemies in the original two Dooms, Doom 2016 monsters are really agile. They will jump, run, take cover and sometimes it was really tough to break their line of fire while dealing with multiple threats at the same time.
[b][u]Better weapons[/u][/b]. Doom 1 & 2 weapons were kind of silly as some were clearly better than others. You almost never used the Pistol, regular Shotgun and Chainsaw (maybe for lulz), because Super Shotgun and Rocket Launcher can deal with 98% of the threats. Chaingun and Plasmagun were occasionally useful, but mostly only when you didn't have enough rockets/shells, and for Plasmagun specifically, you wanted to keep the cells for shooting BFG. Here I found myself using a fully upgraded Pistol quite often, and addons like Stun Bombs and Cluster Strike can turn a mediocre weapon into a really great one. Some addons are more useful than others, but it's cool that you can adapt these to your playstyle.

[h1]What I did NOT like[/h1]
[b][u]Glory Kills (GK)[/u][/b] I am a very straightforward person, so I will start with the biggest offender. A lot of people will be surprised by this, but I find this mechanic to be an absolutely unnecessary gimmick. This game sends [i]waves[/i] of enemies at you which are really smart and try to surround you, and the last thing you want to do is get close and personal with them, and you especially do not want to be locked in an unskippable animation. The fact that some enemies [i]can not[/i] be killed other than via GKs (more on this later) was the first major red flag for me. I would feel completely fine about GKs if they weren't pushed down your throat at every possible occasion. Weapon upgrade points are often locked behind a ""kill a specific enemy via specific GK X times"" rtial which ends up being really frustrating as it's quite difficult to control which GK you are performing, especially in the middle of a fight. I also don't really understand what replenishing health, armour and ammo has to do with mutilating enemies with your bare fists and why regular kills can't accomplish that too, and I especially don't get how a Chainsaw turns even the weakest Possessed into walking ammo crates.
[b][u]Lack of continuity[/u][/b] Level design in Doom 1 & 2 wasn't the best, but if anything, it usually had a sense of fluidity in it. You started a level with enemies all over the map, and wherever you went, someone was waiting for you, and often in large numbers. In Doom 2016 you can walk around the map aimlessly until you reach a trigger point, a minor encounter ensues, you promptly finish that and then everything is calm again. The same happens when you enter a room with a Gore Nest.. *[i]sigh*.[/i] Every time I approached one, I knew I had to endure yet another ""suddenly all the exits are blocked until you deal with the monsters [i]here[/i]"" encounter. The game kinda tries to convey that it's because of a sudden demonic infestation in the area.. I beg your pardon, but did you pay any attention to what's happening around the facility, or these piles of gore, mutilated bodies and occult symbols smeared with blood all over the complex are part of your everyday R&D activity? These ""lockdowns"" start to get old really fast and this breaks the immersion. Speaking of lockdowns, I was playing this game in 2021, which is somewhat amusing.
[b][u]Music[/u][/b] Yes, music. It absolutely rocks when you do get to hear it, but you only hear it during fights. When you are not fighting, there are only ambient noises and monster sounds to entertain you, so it kinda overlaps with the previous point. Both Doom 1 & 2 had music that was playing continuously and never let you go. There were some really eerie tracks like [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cixW6rogZ48&t=5088s]Shawn's Got the Shotgun[/url] or [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cixW6rogZ48&t=5920s]The Demon's Dead[/url] which kept you on the edge at all times. I miss that kind of continuous accompaniment.
[b][u]Bosses[/u][/b] ""Boss Health Bar"" setting was the second major red flag that something might be seriously wrong with this game. Why there are bosses in a shooter game? Why all of the ""boss fights"" happen in stupid flat arenas with no cover where you have to dodge, jump and run around from telegraphed attacks like it's a bloody Dark Souls clone? And finally, why, just why of all mechanics you chose those bloody Glory Kills to be the [i]ONLY[/i] way to kill the boss once and for all?
[b][u]Badass Hero is Badass[/u][/b] First of all, the name [i]Doom Slayer[/i] sounds like a creative product of an 8-year old human male. Second, when I first heard that ""[i]RIP AND TEAR[/i]"", I chuckled, because it sounded really silly (look up Doom comics if you don't know what I am talking about), but then they doubled down and went full on with that silly premise and literally made the protagonist into a full-blown r/iamverybadass representation, which you can see from the way he interacts with the story and all the GKs. I am [i]very[/i] confused.
[b][u]BAD Auto-save[/u][/b] I don't mind having no save option and I can endure the game automatically saving at weird moments (saving right in front of the Cyberdemon really hit the nerve for me), but why can't I load the game from a previous checkpoint? I don't want to restart a level when I suddenly understand that I missed a secret or finished a big fight with 20 HP before. Why limit this option?
[b][u]Unskippable animations[/u][/b] New enemies appearing for the first time. New guns being picked up for the first time. Bosses. Cutscenes. Taking Praetor Suit upgrade tokens. Keys. Why do I need to sit through all of this every time, especially when I reset the game from checkpoint?

[h1]Final conclusion[/h1]
I quit the game after I completed the Cyberdemon ""boss fight"" (again, on Ultra-Violence, and again, this was my first ever attempt at playing the game) and decided that I don't want to put myself through this very frustrating experience any further. I like shooters which force you to think and use environment in creative ways, but these locked-down arenas, forced mechanics and [i]badassness[/i] turned my gameplay from ""this new Doom game seems fun!"" down to ""oh.. it's [i]that thing[/i] again.. when will this finally end.."". In terms of difficulty, I wouldn't say that the game feels really difficult on Ultra-Violence. It feels frustrating and maybe even a bit easy, because you don't experience constant action -- it's very sporadic and pocketed, and I am really saddened by the fact that level designers chose to force the player to fight into locked arenas instead of making the demonic infestation really palpable by properly populating the levels with demons.

5/10"
FUCKING SECRET PASSAGE IS RUINING THE FUN SO MUCH AND TOO MUCH! DOOM SUPPOSE TO BE SHOOTING AND KILLING AND FUCKING KILL ALL OF THEM NOT SPEND AN HOURS LOOKING FOR SECRET SHIT TO UPGRADE UR WEAPON. I REFUND THIS SHIT!
"I cannot recommend Doom. I've tried and I've given the game the benefit of the doubt, but at the end of the day, it's not good. 

Firstly, I'll start with the positives: The game had so much potential. A frantic FPS from ID, that's unlike most of the FPS games that have come out in the last century. 

So, what's wrong with the game? The biggest and most inherent issue and why I don't recommend the game is that it's unbalanced. Enemy difficulty goes between 2 extremes (too easy and too hard) and there is never a middle ground. 

Some enemies feel like they are designed to be a waste of time. Summoners. for example, are both difficult to deal with and to shoot at, and don't add much variety to the game. 

I don't think Doom is balanced. Death, after death, I try to understand what is going wrong. I go away and come back and continuously fail. Even after I kill a swarm of enemies, it is not followed with a sense of accomplishment.

2/5."
The fast movement throws me off.
Didn't see Margret Thatcher.
I found one of the secret classic level areas. I was having so much fun with it that I decided to go and play that game instead
l couldn't get into it
"This is bad, much worse than original Dooms or Doom 3. Not at any point did I feel like what was happening was realistic or engaging. Shame on you, ID!"
Go play Doom Eternal instead
"I'll write a lengthy one later, but essentially this is all the worst bits of Halo wearing Quake 4 skin on its face, that was painted in DooM 3 colours.

Fucking parkour and QTE, checkpoints in a classic twitch fps game? Are you kidding me? RPG-ish weapon ""upgrades"" in an iconic shooter?

The reason for positive reviews is probably memes or newb players, who can't tell a masterpiece FPS from a mediocre title, or people who grew up on Sanec, TF2 and Halo (God forbid).

Souless, grindy Painkiller clone, with ""Of course I'm using a gamepad to play FPS, why do you ask? Do I have a Nintendo Switch? Of course I do!"" soy undertones.

Every area has tons of secrets, which I am not interested in, but get this.... you armour can have an upgrade that makes your compass ""glow"" if there is a secret nearby, defeating the whole purpose.

Monotone, headache-inducing fucking soundtrack, that sounds mostly like a guy banging his musical instruments and his head against a wall in a violent fit. 

Weapons look like giant boxes with triggers on them -- they're absolutely the same. Be it ""assault rifle"" or ""rocket launcher"", your guy is running around with a FedEx box that fires coloured balls of things...

Enemies are a generic set of high-tech shit and bits of demon flesh. Whether you play this, or Quake 4, or whatever other modern shooter with ""monsters"" -- you can't tell the difference. They all just rush you, some scale walls, some strafe, but that's about it. There are also monsters that shift to other ends of the level and open portals, so you get the infinite enemies bullshit that is seen on nightmare difficulty in older games. Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to have been executed Imp-style -- their hands ripped off and then beaten to death with their own severed appendages.

Now gameplay is just that -- shooting areas of dumb monsters, which gets tedious after the first level. Jesus Christ, even in DOOM II they've wandered away from you at times, whilst here they just rush at you head on.

Story is shoved in your face through endless monologues by NPCs, it feels like you're playing a movie, not a game. Swathes of text walls, meaningless. This thing would be better off without a plot, than with what they have here.

The level design is utter cow manure: endless generic sci-fi corridors, and ""hell"" is like someone threw a mixture of glowsticks and lasagna in your face.

Digusting to even claim this has anything to do with DooM. Classic Bethesda.

Just play Dusk."
"Too many hidden/secret areas.
I want to shoot demons not search for toys."
I want to shoot demons but I spend 80% of the time walking around trying to get to the marker.
"I like how they tried to make something faithful to the original, but found it got pretty monotonous after a bit.  I'm not a fan of the ""glory kill"" mechanism as it really deflates any sort of tactics, because you can just squeeze some health out of any enemy, plus the hero is invincible during the animation, making things easier.  Thematically, I don't get why the marine would want to leave enemies half alive just so he could finish them off by hand.    

The automap is a pain during the bigger levels because it doesn't show all of the walls and gates.  So you might think you can walk freely from point A to B when you're looking at the map - nope! In reality, there's a gate blocking your path.   It's really frustrating.   Some levels try to do the old Doom style layouts, where you have to collect the keys and then head back to the critical path, but mostly it's just a linear progression.  There's a compass that point you in the right direction... except, sometimes it points you to a path that's blocked, which isn't helpful.   

I do like the jumping controls, but there's way too much jumping in general.  The original Doom didn't have jumping at all! 

I'm still playing it, but can't wait for it to be over.  It feels way too long for what it is."
.
"While there is indeed an incredible soundtrack to this game, it is unforunately a scavenger hunt with occasional bits of very fun shooting. I really do not enjoy running around the same areas squeezing into tight corners I have no other reason to go into just to pick up toys so that my stats can keep pace with the game. I found myself spending almost all of my time doing this.

Also it later asks you to start doing combo kills and trying to play the game a certain way, and I'm already wasting time looking for dead guys (in levels full of dead guys) and toys. If there was a way to skip collectibles entirely, I'd have actually enjoyed this game."
"I'm a fan of the original Doom (1993) and Doom 3, but I don't like this one.

During the shooting sections the game is a hell lot of fun, but in between those you have to navigate through way too large, maze-like levels.
On top of that this game is half a collectathon?! Usually this wouldn't be a problem, as one could simply ignore it, but here the collectibles are used to upgrade your gear!

So in the end, three hours of Doom were 20% shooting and 80% navigating through the maze-like levels while trying to find the upgrades and bonus objectives. With all the added bonus objectives, collectibles, challenges and excessive ammo/health drops it also feels much more arcadey and less immersive than the previous titles."
Mid
"I can not recommend this game. tried playing through it a few times but it's so bland.
Nice graphics can't cover the dull gameplay for me. 

get locked in room => fight monsters => repeat.

Looks nice and runs great but really it's just not Doom.
guns sound meh which makes the impact of your shots feel the same.
soundtrack is ok but nothing special really.

Brutal doom is more fun imho."

redundant when you could just play the objectively superior original doom and doom 2
Not for me.

"Good game, there aren't enough enemies to fight in most areas and when you really feel like the combat has reached its climax there aren't anymore enemies left to kill, making you feel left hanging.

Tho the main reason for the negative review is that the game will reset all controller binds when it loads, not just when the game starts up but after you die, and inbetween levels, forcing you to either use mouse and keyboard or making a custom config file to save your settings so they don't get overwritten, then use the console to reset the controls every single time you leave a loading screen."
"this game gets unbelievably boring and stale after the first few hours. Same cycle of ""enter room > enemies spawn > kill enemies > platforming"" repeat for 10 hours. 

The hype was real and I think ID did a great job in reinvigorating the franchise, but after the dust has settled, Doom (2016) ended up being a really well running and gorgeous game that's unfortunately bogged down by a really lackluster and frankly boring campaign."
doom eternal is superior in every way
"👎 Slow movement speed
👎 There is a story that's also lame
👎 No manual saves

👍 Graphics
👍 Sound

Play the Quake 1 remaster, Amod Evil, etc. if you want a good and actually fact-paced game.

At 40 years old I'm clearly still way too young to play this snail-paced game. Maybe I'll pick it up again when I'm 80 and had a stroke. Maybe then the lack of speed will be good."
hi
I used to like to play this.  Now it wont even start.  Shame the games moved from something you actually owned to on line vaporware
After all this hype i thought it would be much better. 4/10
"This game is ridiculously overrated. When I first started playing this game I loved it. No tutorial, gory and stylish aesthetics, fast-pased actions with some epic finishing moves and such. It took me several levels to notice how poor the navigation and platforming in this game is, and its a big part of the game. You feel like you're skating on ice. The amount of times I slid off the map and died when I was just trying to move slightly to the side or backwards was ridiculous, whereas there is a mouse aiming sensitivity setting there is no movement sensitivity setting so this was extremely frustrating to me. 

The suit upgrades are mostly pretty lame so I was hardly ever excited to get them, the gun mods are often poorly explained (how am I supposed to understand that ""turns the gun into a mobile turret"" means -adds a second barrel to it doubling its firing rate-? wtf is that tooltip...). Beyond that theres nothing here. You have only 3 stats to boost and 2 of them (armor and health) do the same thing, why even make a distinction?

Lastly, and this is the biggest issue for me, the gun play feels awful. None of the guns FEEL like they have any punch to them, which in a shooter is like fully censored nudity in porn - what is even the point of the product then? The feel of gun animations and bullet impact animations is what make or break a shooter for me, and here it is completely broken... Even though the guns look nice, when you fire them they feel like using a water squirter on balloon animals. The monsters just pop and tare with no resistance while the guns don't really feel like they're doing any damage until the visual cues let you know that the monster is dead or staggered. This leads to a complete lack in satisfaction during the main part of the gameplay, and because it is extremely repetative, by the endgame it is nothing but a pain to get through it...

I did want to stop and give credit where credit is due - the graphics look awesome. The themes of hell appealed greatly to the horror fan in me and the overall aesthetics are great. The game also has tons of nostalgia-based pleasure for the fans of the classic doom games, I couldn't help but appreciate this.

In conclusion the game's gameplay is such a muted, repetative slog with little satisfaction involved in upgrading and developing your character (if you can call him that). The platforming is archaic and very frustrating. However the game is very cool to look at; the themes are badass af. Ultimately though, all of this makes this game much more fun to look at than to play. As much as I want to enjoy it as a fan of the classic dooms, I really could not and I am so confused by the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this game... how am I the only person bothered by these jarring flaws?"
"Great game, fun and enjoyable...

BUT

if you ever crash, your save files become corrupted and the game becomes unplayable, thank you for nothing!"
"The action is great. Saddly i have a really bad sense of direction... so most of the time, i run in empty corridors building frustration. I regret the purchase."

"I do not recommend. Boring battle (RUNRUNRUNRUNJUMPRUNRUNRUN) and frustrating maps.

Every map:
Search for a room with a button, 
go through a corridor, 
find the room,
kill everything inside,
press the button,
demons spawn,
run around killing everything,
Use chainsaw to cut a enemy in hald to fill ammunition,
continue killing demons running around the room,
look at the minimap for possible secrets after killing everything,
spend 15–30 minutes looking for a small hatch or tunnel somewhere,
(or realize that you can only get the secret later or you should have done so in a previous room)
get the secret, 
go though a corridor towards next button to press,
find the room, run around shooting at the demons.
Repeat
Repeat
Repeat

Replay the map to find missed secrets
Or 
think ""oh f*** this"" and continue with a new mission."
"I haven't played this game much but I can say this much
Pros:
Good OST
Game is pretty violent, which is good in this case.
Cons:
This game is compeletely repititive, you go into a room and kill a bunch of samy enemies, sometimes you need to «activate» a room and fight several waves of same enemies, which are spawing from the air (or maybe from our protagonist's arse).
Protag is compeletely puny and cannot carry more than 20 shotgun shells or 50 «assault rifle» bulliets.
But you can fix it with upgrades (no, just no).
He also can't reload because the game has NO RELOADING MECANIC and WEAPONS DOESN'T HAVE THE IRON SIGHTS!
This game is basically Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare without any allies, who will open doors for you.
This game has pretty little in common with the actual Doom franchise or with any of good oldshcool FPS.
I had played Wolfenstein the New Order on PS3 and had more fun shooting at enemies with a controller than playng this on an actual mouse.
My subjective score — 6 Woflensteins TNO on PS3 out of 10."
"game crashes every 2 minutes, unplayable"
"it's too gory when you have to saw aliens in half , and there is blood all over the place"
Modern Doom is a joke. Do not fall for the trend. You are better than them.
"Very poorly designed, manages to get repetitive instantly after the first ""encounter""."
i love doom but on pc it is so bad it lags and it gave me a virus my save flies get delted evey day i do not recommend you get doom on a pc and i am going to try get my money back and buy it on my ps4
"Very repetitive gunplay where you 1) shoot and 2) finish off with melee glorykills on repeat. Lack of minimap means you need to visually scan your surroundings for enemies (whose colours bleed into their surroundings). The amount of ledges and platforms in the arenas makes it more annoying to locate and dispatch enemies.

Confusing platforming and exploration. No minimap means you have to constantly open map screen to get your bearings. Also there isn't an option to fix the map in one direction which keeps rotating to your direction, personal preference and all,  makes making sense of the layout more annoying."
"Все баги и лаги игры становятся очень заметны когда апгрейдишь комп. А их к сожалению невероятно много. Баги и лаги со стрельбой это вообще жестяк. Раньше списывал на старенькую видеокарту, Но терь понятно - понабирали по объявлению программеров..."
Slow after playing Eternal
bad
"Story-wise Doom 3 was more interesting. On the plus side, it's still Doom, and hasn't lost its core."
"another fps spoilt by impossible jumping, what on earth is wrong with these brain dead game developers that they cannot understand that people come for a bit of fun and a journey.
waste of money.
added to that is why is so called easy mode so wretchedly difficult the games industry is a massive rip off of epic proportions saved by a handful of decent releases."
The game is boring period
I don't want to rip and tear anymore; i just want to be happy.
"I think I've finally accepted that Doom games aren't for me. I don't care about Doom Guy, the setting, or the music. The enemy execute system is such a boring and repetitive core mechanic of the game. You can't even turn the difficulty up without beating the game first. It's really held back by these two elements for me, and I don't even know if I can stomach attempting to play Eternal. Maybe in a couple years when I forget this experience."
.
mediocre
"I played the demo and bought the game, but I forgot why I didn't immediately rush out to buy it. 

While I've definitely seen worse in the AAA sphere, it still feels like they're putting the gameplay second to graphics. 

I bought it for the way the story was told, but the demo was much more story dense than the full game. 

I feel like I'm not getting my time's worth from this game, especially since I was left feeling wholly emotionally unstimulated by this game."
Despite only having 1.8 hours on this game it is boring af. It’s really just a dusty waste land on Mars and a big space ship on the surface. It’s nothing really good. Not worth the 20 bucks.
Not a game of my liking.
"Not much sick music. I wanted sick music and demon killing, but guns feel weak and the upgrades are confusing."
Mission start -> (Go into a big room and kill monsters for 10 minutes) X 3 -> Mission end
"MFs took my fucking textures



can't have shit in hell"
"This game physically hurt.
I have sensitive hearing and after playing until the fourth level or so I had a terrible headache, no other game has managed to do that this bad. Not to mention spending more time running around in circles and looping back to grab upgrades than actually fighting demons."
I had the game but i deleted it for space and now i don't have it
"This is NOTHING LIKE  the simplistic and thought provoking series - this is way-too "" technical "" - you just want to shoot things ? - well dont look for this game to be a"" fun  "" experience..  oh the graphics are great! ( dont get me wrong ) - but platforms dont work,  and its too hard to   work out how to save your position - you have to play with almost A.I. precision even on the easiest level. In the ORIGINAL doom...you found secret rooms an items - but you had the opportunity to find new more powerful weapons. but this? this is just stupid.

I think ID soft have lost the plot and forgotten the basic laws of "" fun "".. its too difficult to "" learn "" all these rules and things.. - whatever happened to simple shoot em ups with great maps?  They went WAY-TOO TECHNICAL with this edition. People just want to have some shoot em up fine like the ORIGINAL was - not this over-bearing rubbish. - I do NOT recommend this game for people that just want some doom in the "" classical "" terms - this is too difficult to actually "" enjoy ""."
why do i have to agree to a term of service bethesda?
"This game is a generic lame a$$ dumb shooter. It's not worth anything, really. How it's ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" is just beyond reason. Are you like just pretending that it's cool because it's doom, that's it?"
"I'll refund it. Not fun. Shoot the enemies, when they glow, press f and that's all. Also, it doesn't feel like you're shooting at something. Bullets just touch to demons until they glow. Yesterday I was playing Middle earth shadow of mordor. Even in that game, when you slain orcs, you feel like you're killing something. But in this game, feels like you're shooting paintball pellets.

Walking around sci-fi maze labs isn't fun too. I can't really get how this game became very popular."
"This game is a snooze-fest. Shoot monster until they glow, press button for QTE, repeat until the room is clear. I have no idea how this game achieved notoriety, it's so overwhelmingly boring."
"run gun run gun jump look at confusing map run gun jump lots of noise...throw brain in the bin...run gun jump....wow...if i play this a few more hours i'll get the ""you are now clinically retarded"" achievement ..yeah not for everyone"
Once again a tipical american greedy crap bullshir. it get's harder by the minute. Monkey never learns.Your time is allmoust Up us Morons!!!
nao funciona da erro
"Annoying platform elements and useless double tap jumps boots WTF!! why not a jetpack it would be more practical. Enjoyed the game up until I felt like Mario jumping across a pipeline after that the game became a tedious slog and if you don't have the correct weapons selected before going into an area you will get your a*se handed to you, preferred the mid 2000s Doom reincarnated as BFG, felt like ti was more story driven"
overrated
"This is the first game I've refunded in a while. I felt that the weapons had very little audio/visual feedback and felt weak against the spongy enemies. There is very little sense of danger, something which is very important in these games. Little sense or feeling of anything at all really. Damage enemy, press 'F', rinse and repeat. It's just not for me."
Took me 8 hours to finish the game...
"A lot of violence and gore. Do not support it and against of them.
In general games and especially like this one are bad for mental health and conscientious."
"When I launched the game I was greeted with dozens of EULA's and Code of Coduct (of course) which Bethesda require's you to accept before you can proceed with the game.
This is despite having no warning on the store page about that.
If you actually read the Code of Conduct you'll discover it contains the ususal cancer about ""protected categories"", ""hate speech"", ""disruptive behavior"" and even (I kid you not!) ""spreading of false information or conspiracy theories about ZeniMax and its game studios, game(s), or employees"".
I'm sorry but there's only so much cancer I can take at a time.
Anyway, this all looks like the rules for the Zenimax's forum or something. Except I'm not on a forum, I just want to play damn signle-player game. I'm not planning to talk to anyone and no-one should be forced to accept these terms for just wanting to play the game.

Asked for a refund."
"The game is fun for a first person shooter story game. Although, the story was predictable, and the game is RIDDLED with game ending glitches. What do i mean by ""game ending glitches?"" I mean because you threw a grenade, and tried to fire your weapon too fast it glitches, and doesn't allow you to shoot, throw grenades, or switch weapons. (while big demons are destroying you i might add) The only fix i could find when it happened, AND IT HAPPENED OFTEN, was opening steam overlay, and exiting it until it allowed me to use my weapons again. 
The suit upgrades would put upgrades into the next tier rather than the one you quicked so instead of being explosive damage resistant, i was instead a better map scanner. 
for a game 5 years after it came out, the fact that these simple, everyday glitches haven't been fixed tells me to tell yall NOT TO GIVE THESE PEOPLE MORE MONEY!! I was playing to finish the game, nothing else. 
Other than all that, i'd give the game a 3/10
without the glitches? 6.5/10. I'd go back, and watch youtube videos of the important parts if you were playing for Doom Eternal backstory.

I do like Doom Slayers backstory though, pretty cool on that front. Skip this game though, they aren't going to fix the glitches, and they make it almost unplayable. I would've quit after the 2nd time, but i'm stubborn."
this game is way overhyped it absolutely sucks lmao
"dogshit game supposed to be action but makes you backtrack/look for keys/listen to bullshit story that isn't interesting

game put my gun away and locked me in a room during some narration sequence and at that point I had enough."
"This game is fine but it leans wayyy to heavily into treasure hunting. You spend about 5 minutes killing and then a half-hour scouring the map trying to find a damn upgrade. Treasure hunting is more rewarded then combat, a majority of the upgrades are from finding shit. Weapon Mods, Suit Upgrades, Health/Ammmo Upgrades, ""Secrets"", essential guns (!), Runes, Doom Guy figurines, useless Map Lore. All of it is found by scouring every nook and cranny of the map. You decide to either look for the crap, which kills the game momentum, or you press on and hope that you didn't need that Health Upgrade."
"Probably is very fun, but stutters continuously on minimum settings with an i5-8400 and a GTX 1070. I'll probably try again if I can ever get a new video card."
Why does the game come with a stupid button right next to your weapon select... that when you press it completely corrupts your save?
Multi is deader than Epstein.
i dont like doom guy he is ray william johnson
Too much melee
"I felt weird for refunding this game but it's not that enjoyable for me to be honest. It's good but it's not for me, so try it for yourself and make your own decision."
"You know I would've gotten farther, but it seems like they just wanna kill me with their mine carts! What another bugthesda masterpiece of garbage 0/10"
"Despite no third party EULA warning on the store page, the game greets you with an unskippable EULA when you start the program. Scummy. That means they are counting on you blindly or begrudgingly accepting, having just installed a 60GB game and invested time and resources into it already."
"If you are a NOT a hardcore old-school DOOM, this a well made modern FPS that will probably give you an average of 8-10 hours of fun, just get in on sale and enjoy.

If you ARE a hardcore old-school DOOM or FPS player, I do not recommend this game, you will be disappointed."
"Overall game is good but secrets can go fuck themselves because when you go back and it says ""checkpoint reached"" and you exit and save it saves it and you can look back and it says you've done it but as soon as you press continue game when you're done everything resets and this makes it literally impossible to get the secrets unless you've already completed the campaign. Wasted 2 days of gametime on this shit fuck this game. If Steam wasn't bullshit I'd ask for a refund."
bad game
too many cutscenes  not enough demon killing 0 out 2
Was fun until awful checkpoint placement in Lazarus lab wanted me to replay WHOLE section... no Ill rather not play game with bad checkpoints....
"idk, not really all that fun. Games have this thing called ""mastery"" or something, you achieve it over time and it makes the game feel good to play. Alongside that, this game has a lot of issues to pair it with. The entire game is just shooting aliens and watching unskippable cutscenes (ofc), but there are points in every damn level where you finish clearing a room and have to backtrack through this labyrinth of a map, trying to figure out which doors you can and cannot open with what keycards you currently have, none of which is easily labeled on the level map you can pull up.
On top of that, there is just way too little ammo in this game. You can find the ammo pickups (specific to each weapon) or you can get RNG drops from enemies when you use a finisher, which you should basically be doing on every single alien to get enough ammo even on the easiest difficulty. I can't imagine how often you'd be using the nerf gun of a pistol if you were playing on a difficulty where the enemies were even greater bullet-sponges...

The momentum is nice, the shooting is ok, the gameplay is a little less action-oriented than something like Half Life, to my surprise, which also isn't really my cup of tea.

Edit: I have been informed from multiple sources that the shortcomings I touched upon here are in fact bullshit, and were fixed in the sequel, so I now feel 100% justified in my assessment.

Edit 2: They were not ""fixed"" in the sequel, merely replaced. All of my issues with the combat and map design are still valid but in a different frustrating way."
مملة و فيها تكرار
overrated piece of shit. 5 years has passed and they never addressed save file corruption/deletion. ubisoft tier devs
"For some reason I just found it really boring, especially when compared to similar shooters (Painkiller Black, Shadow Warrior). Just like the Wolfenstein remakes I can see the great deal of effort put into the game and everything works fine, but compared to the classic games it just feels hollow and lacking in charm."
I have turned off razor setting but my keyboard lights go crazy when i play and i cannot turn it off. it hurts my eyes so bad and flashes and could probably give someone epilepsy. i hate it. ruined the game for me.
Poor Controller imputes not very inclusive of you my guys.
It's a great game at first. Then it starts to get boring pretty fast. I prefer fast game play over this. You are better off with Project Brutality over this.
"theres more times i've noclipped through the map by glory killing a demon than there are stars in the sky

just play doom eternal instead"
there is a glitch where if you throw a grenade and shoot your gun you wont be able to swap or use any abilities and this happens at least 40% of the time I play this game.
"I understand that this is a game well loved by everybody but it just didn't click with me. It was truly a slog to play through the 12 hours that I did where I would play an hour or two once every month or so until I finally realized I am never going to enjoy the game.

Movement feels floaty. Guns aren't really satisfying. Enemy types are REALLY boring despite being so varied. The first 2 or so hours rocked until I realized the entire game was going to just be Enter room -> clear room -> kill boss (or miniboss) on repeat forever"
this game is so slow for a doom game
"Developers, Please! I can not get this game to run!"
"The shooting is fun, the endless scavenger hunt is not. I don't want to miss out on an important game feature or not be able to upgrade my guns just because I miss a turn."
too easy
too much blood and shooting
"I guess this game was just not for me. I've played some of doom 95 back in a day and I enjoyed doom 3 when it came out, yes I'm old, but this one, not so much. It's just too repetitive and dull for me. Maybe if multiplayer wasn't dead... Now I do get why most new players would like this version. If you're into rampaging through hordes of hellspawn your're in for  a treat. For me, I was looking for a horror shooter with constant tension and looking anxiously at every dark corner. If you're looking for more of a doom 3 feel you won't like it, but if you're looking for an all out war on hell, this one is for you!"
"The constant combat, enemies, gore and epic music makes this a very satisfying experience along with its detailed hellish landscape with it. In terms of the singleplayer campaign, it is very repetitive, but satisfying. You basically murder your way through the arena, completing whatever objectives you have, exit to next arena repeat. In other words, the campaign is EXTREMELY repetitive and the level design is too complex. I don't even know how many times I've gotten lost or try to figure how to get back to a certain spot. The multiplayer is basically Quake. End of story. Overall, the game is one of the most satisfying games I've played in terms of combat, but even with that satisfaction, the feeling gets worn off by constant repetition in the campaign. I don't hate the game, but don't love it either."
Too hard shit.
Tryhard camp.  Lame and stupid and thinks it can get away with it by noticing how lame and stupid it is.  Gameplay that beats you over the head with its formula.  Tedious and unfun.
Huge FPS drops....tried everything but still get them with a 1060 maxq even on low settings
insufficent space
"Honestly, I don't know why everyone raves about this game. Not to say that the developers didn't do a good job, but it's just very bland. Sure the graphics look nice, but that doesn't make up for how repetitive the game is. I mean I guess some people can deal with mindless shooting of things but I can't really. There isn't anything to keep the game fresh after 10 hours of playing. Severely disappointed with how highly this game is spoken about."
"I know I'm in the minority here, but this game does not live up to the hype. All the levels look the same with random gore splattered on everything, and the music gets really old really quick because listening to blaring heavy metal can only be entertaining for so long. 

The worst part is the gameplay. It is very active and movement-based, but its the same loop time and time again. The way you play (run in circles and hold down shoot when your crosshairs pass over a demon while screeching heavy metal blares in your ears) never changes for the entire game. The only thing that really changes is the weapon you choose to use but even that has no effect on how you play. 

One of the most annoying things is that they have multiple waves of enemies in a lot of these rooms, and if you're having trouble with something on the last wave you have to keep re-fighting through all the waves leading up to it after you die, which makes difficult sections simply frustrating and tedious."
EPIC TERROR
"I like DOOM games, but this one didn't do it for me. I heard good things about it and decided to give it a try, and while I enjoyed it at first, that quickly wore off. This game suffers from poor and confusing level design, EXTREMELY repetitive combat, and horrible weapon balance (Which also contributes to the repetition since There are some clearly overpowered weapons that make most combat encounters a joke.) Eventually I just got bored and quit. It's not a bad game, but you can definitely tell that DOOM Eternal is more polished."
Final boss bug still not fixed. (after 3 final boss kills i could finally somehow do glory kill...)
Yeah it's cool but also boring.
"Unnecessary and weak... Guns does tesla powered pew sound instead of hard BANG and gunplay feels like im shooting from plastic nerf guns instead of... Well just look at them. Enemies feels like basic ai ""go for the player"" with bullet sponge numbers. Died 2 times in 1h playtime because of bugs and got stuck in a wall after ""finisher"" once."
"Pretty sure tedious arena fighting was more a Serious Sam thing than a Doom one, and there and at the time it made sense, I guess people like this kind of 'gameplay' where you either have ape-like reflexes and are already good at the game, or train yourself like some sort of idiot computer algorithm to quickly recognize moving shapes ? Sad. I even hear some believe there is 'tactical thinking' involved, like they genuinely believe an 8-year-old with better reflexes wouldn't beat them at this dumb waste of time. Impressive levels of delusion and conceit."
"It looks to be a decent game, better than Doom 3 at least. The issue I have with it is that it makes me violently ill from motion sickness. I've managed to play it for about an hour total over two sessions and both sessions ended the same way: me calling Herb on the big white telephone. No game since We Love Katamari has made me so ill. If you're not troubled by motion sickness you may find something to enjoy here. Maybe, I don't know. I never got far enough in to see. If you are a fellow sufferer, you've been warned."
"One of the worst games I have ever played, I have absolutely nothing good to say about it.

I don't know how anyone can find it enjoyable in any way, some people do, and you might be one of them, but this is my review so you're getting my opinion, which is that the game is not even worth thinking about getting, even if it was free"
"A Doom wiithout modding, with sickening orange hue all over, and with shotgun that sounds like a sneeze. Yuck."
0/10 too much blood
"While the game itself is pretty good and fun, i'm leaving a negative review because of the glitch regarding your progression through missions.

I tried going back to a mission I once completed to re-clear and get any missing collectables, however I have realized that the mission progression is pretty much stuck no matter what you do. I've looked for a workaround for this problem but it appears there's no solution to this."
"it was a great game until a bug prevented me from finishing the game. An invisible wall prevented me from glory killing the final boss after defeating it. This bug is the worst I can remember encountering in any game I've ever played. It spoiled the experience ultimately and will make me think twice about buying Doom Eternal. I played the entire game and did not get the satisfaction I earned for beating it. WHY THE HELL DID THEY NOT FIX THIS BUG? IT'S BEEN FOUR FUCKING YEARS AND BETHESDA IS A HUGE COMPANY!
Also, the fps dropped from 50-70 to 15 in the last mission, making it way more frustrating than it would have been otherwise. Ultimately, the game is a lot of fun but Bethesda should have patched this giant, game-breaking bug."
"I really enjoyed this game's multiplayer on Xbox and was very excited to play it on PC. Bought it, loaded up, adjusted settings, and no matches. Dead game even on a Saturday evening sadly but even when we would barely have enough people to start the game at least 1 or 2 people would be auto booted to reset the search for players and intermission countdown.. I was the one booted a few of those times but would see others go and comeback all the same. Is the game dead cause the multiplayer is broken?? Please fix this.."
Far cry from what Doom 3 offered.  Game focuses on alternate objectives and quick shooting vs the immersive fear/hell narrative once forefront in Doom games.
"This game just isn't fun.  

Yes I know: millions sold, rave reviews, a successful sequel - I'm obviously in a minority here.  I think the biggest problem for me is that making the Glory Kill mechanic central to progression strips all the fun out of it, weaker enemies merely become ""health pinatas"", as I once heard it aptly described.   And for a game that apparently resulted from a desire to make an updated Doom game that 'feels like Doom' - well, it just doesn't feel like Doom.  Why not just make a Doom game with the basic mechanics of the original, but with updated graphics and controls, and some cool new weapons?  In a way, I would even have preferred if they had released the abandoned 'Call of Doomy' version this replaced, if only out of curiosity to see how it came out.

I know there are people looking at my playtime and thinking 'that idiot just hasn't played it enough, he probably hasn't even got any of the good weapons or started to play the  fun parts', and they may well be right.  The truth is though that those three hours felt like thirty to me.  I just don't like it."
"Huge disappointment.  I love FPS games, and the original Doom series was epic, but this is just a repetitive mess made worse by the checkpoint saves."
"almost to the end and game freezes halfway though level and i have to hard reset it to close the game, i have hp omen 15 1660ti and play warzone regularly so i doubt problem is on my end, this game is 5 years old and made millions of dollars fix your fn bugs?!? also all the satan blowhards saying this is the greatest game are dorks its good but its by far not the greatest game ever released"
"Dark and edgy, in a boring way."
"Wow blood, never seen that before."
"If you're looking for a fast paced shooter where you can just chain kills on enemies in the most satisfying as ways possible (as I was), this might not be the game for you. Emphasis on might as I know that this game is very well received and do see some aspects that would make it more enjoyable for other people. For me however, I really just didn't enjoy it. It felt slow. I would just walk around, occasionally shoot some enemies, press e on the occasion I needed to interact with something, wander more trying to figure out where I needed to go, and the level ends. This is not the fun gameplay I was expecting from Doom. Now who knows. Speaking that my playtime was literally just 40 minutes, it might get better later on in the game. However, the slow intro that I experienced defiantly did not keep me interested in continuing. The game looks nice, it plays nice, but gameplay wise, it isn't my cup of tea."
"It's just kind of ok, I guess.

The shootin' has a good amount of speed and aggression required, but not as much as DOOM or other boomer shooters. 

Repetition in combat is kind of fine, but I can't say I felt any kind of real connection to it.

Waaaay too many platforming sections. Personally I found the level exploration kind of annoying, as I fell off the level many times and was sent back to the start.

The main plot is generic and boring, but it bashes you over the head and forces you to listen to NPC dialogue, even though Mr Doom Guy doesn't care.

So many secrets to find, upgrades for your armour, or your weapons. Honestly, none of the upgrades caught my eye, and I don't care about the secret collectables.

I really wanted to like it, but I felt like it struggled to engage me. Any enjoyment I was extracting was counteracted by the bludgeoning from the terrible plot, and being annoyed with the autosave."
"It looks like doom but it's significantly slower paced than the original doom games. Feels like i'm playing call of duty campaign with a really nice realistic doom graphics. Seriously this game sucks ass, it's one of the most hand holding gaming experiences i've ever played, THIS IS FUCKING DOOM WTF. Go play the original Doom's in VR, Bitch."
"This game is damn mess. I've already spent 3 fucking hours trying to get this game to run on my PC by messing around with my GPU settings and all sorts of other stuff. It just won't work.

Edit: I managed to resolve all the damn graphical and framerate issues and it's a pretty good game. Just a shame I had to waste so much time to finally be able to play."
not fun just shoot alien
Combat was boring so I never got around to beating it
"i really can't in good faith recommend a game that has now caused two separate graphics cards to shit themselves every 15 minutes.
-my previous computer had an RX480 3GB card in it. that straight up wouldn't run doom at anything more than potato settings. this is a computer that didn't have problems with other AAA games, but doom at anything other than ""low""? prepare for VRAM errors and crashes. i didn't give it much patience because i was due for an upgrade anyway.
-my current computer has an 8GB RX 5500 HD that runs most games at high or ultra, had zero crashes running Control by remedy games at high, and can run elite dangerous for hours without even blinking. every 5-15 minutes, without fail, i get a ""driver timeout"" and it crashes. on medium. with many graphical features turned off.

just another day at bethesda, i guess. cool to see no one else has as many problems, but i don't have time to go troubleshooting issues like this for hours. there are other games i can be playing."
the creatures are scary
"Awkward level design, falling through maps, missing sounds, randomly timed enemy spawns leaving some areas empty for actual minutes before something that is supposed to spawn finally does, cursor not being locked to the game on fullscreen, weapons becoming obsolete quick even with upgrades, worthless default controls and an absolutely useless 3D map and menu.

Really wanted a game like this but this borders on an unplayable mess.
Genuinely dumbfounded at how this game has >95% positive reviews and revived the franchise."
this game is so insanely boring and overrated and i want to kill myself now because of this game so if i do its your fault losers die
I was expecting a great game. I adjusted the brightness before the campaign started. Once the campaign started the display was so dark and reddish I couldn't even see the enemies. I reinstalled the game but could not reset the brightness. This is a disappointment.
"Tedious trying to find your way around a very samey environment with almost no clues as to where you are, and the same monsters attacking constantly. Even on the very easiest setting it is far too difficult to get through each level. I'm not even halfway through and given up now as it is not possible on easy to beat all the enemy they put against you."
Totally lacks the feeling.
"Doom 2016 is a fun game at times but its very flawed. If you've already played eternal then you most likely are not going to enjoy this. The combat gets extremely repetitive after a few mission and by mission 10 engaging in combat becomes tediuse. Combat is completely broken with things like siege mode, Double fire super shotgun and a rune that frequently gives you BFG ammo from fodder demons. Every fight can be won the same way just spam super shotgun and siege mode maybe the occasional rocket. All of this makes the combat incredible boring, Repetitive and easy. So the main part of a doom game the combat really sucks. The environments arnt much better either. Every mission has the same colour pallet. Just grey, red and piss green. Its boring. The games graphics are very good. For a 5 year old game it still looks great. The game doesnt really have a story unless you dig deep into codexs which for a doom game I think is great way to handle story. But the game still several times locks you in a room with an npc and spends minutes talking about the story with no way to skip them. There are also multiple sections of horrible platforming. Unlike eternals platforming that teaches you how to traverse environments to assist in combat 2016s platforming is entirely pointless and badly designed. It has no purpose and frequently the slayer will just refuse to grab on to ledges for no reason causing you to fall to your death. So in general this is not a good game in my opinion but if you have not played eternal (A much better game) I can see you enjoying this game alot more than I did."
"This game was praised as return to the old days of FPS, i.e. fast, bloody and violence, not story driven. 
Every game reviewer made a huge deal out of the starting sequence when the doom guy, instead listen to the exposition, smashes the monitor. 
Yeah, bravo whooho, down with the dumb standing around and listen to the idiots. 
But the very next cut scene immobilizes me while the doctor lady turns the power on for the drill. 
What is this crap?
If this game was really what is was advertised as, i would have the option to bash the glass in, rip the arms of the women and stick them up her butt!
Glory kills get boring and repetitive after 20 minutes, first person platforming is the same dumb idea it was 20 years ago and these challenges getting passive upgrades are so out of place it kills the immersion. 
Five years after release and the sound problems are still in the game. Hint: Don't use bluetooth headphones.

This game is once more the reason why i don't buy games for more then €10. Because most of them are bad. 
And yes, i'm over 40, i played the original Dooms until the old 90s CRT monitors burned my retinas and this is NOT a faithful successor, no matter what overpaid and bribed ""Game Journalists"" tell you. 
And i'm german, so yeah grammar is not my strong suit. Sue me, how many languages do YOU speak?"
Really hard to aim with and makes me motion sick no matter how low I set the motion blur at
"I want to like it. When the original came out it changed my life forever - I still have the original floppies from when I bought the full game after finishing the shareware.

This game does have all the right ingredients, and a lot of polish, but I keep quitting from boredom. The music is ok, better than just generic heavy metal I guess, with strong influences of Trent Reznor which was a nice callback to Quake, but *yawn*. It looks nice, but I think we're long past the point of being wowwed by visuals in games (or movies). What it is all about is the gameplay, and again, it is great, but...I just can't put my finger on what the X factor is that is missing, but while all the details are there: guns that go boom, small enough ammo supply to want/need to change guns a lot, special melee kill that gives you health (reminds me of Space Marine), chainsaw kills to give you ammo.

I'm going to keep playing it, because I feel like there is something wrong with me, not the game. The friend that bought it for me is having a giddy amount of fun, and describes the combat as a ballet of death, so your mileage may vary, but I'm not at all feeling like I'm going to finish it."
"I was so bored with this game. Enter a room and kill the monsters to open the door to the next room, kill monsters in the next room to open another door that leads to another room to kill monsters in..... that's what this game felt like. I found the combat boring and doing it over and over just didn't make it get any better. Graphics were nice, weapons were meh, controls were good and coop may have made this better, but probably not. If this is doom now then I'm done with this crap. Oh and the weapon upgrade system is trash. What a way to make the game less fun and make me want to play even less..... just another reason to not buy anymore in this series."
dumb. time wasted jumping and finding your way through a maze.  Nothing like DOOM which was a outstanding shooter.  Plenty of saves for those of us who don't have endless hours to spend on a game.
"HELP!!! I love this game and its amazing, but it is constantly freezing during loading into, out of, or between missions. Its unplayable. Im not a computer expert, ive updated all drivers, moved it to mechanical hard drive, moved it back to SSD...gonna try to uninstall and reinstall. Googled the problem and there is no ONE fix but it is a common problem. Sorry if there is somewhere else i should have posted this, only been playing on pc for a couple months. I just want to shoot stuff to a BA soundtrack!!!"
"The visuals for this game are great. Blasting hell monsters with the sick melee animations and soundtrack that makes me feel like a bad-ass. At this point, you may believe I have clicked the wrong review hands on accident, but I have not. For the first 2 or so hours I was absolutely loving this game, but as it went on I realized how dry and repetitive this game really is. It is all basically the same concept with some non creative upgrades. The level design is good, but makes really no difference in games like these. If you enjoy doing the same thing over and over in slightly different ways, this is the one for you. Spend your money on a more creative franchise and lessen the hype of this."
very eh
can anyone fix the error with the recent versions of AMD graphic driver?
4 years later and the loading and lag wont even allow me to start the game. Second computer I have tried it on and my current specs are WAY more than needed.
Game crashes on start up very dissapointed.
"Solid shooter, with awesome graphics and good performance.

So... Why the thumbs down?
Well, as you see I only have a few hours into it.

I've made the mistake buying the game upon the hype. Was interested what it is about, but it honestly feels like that Doom movie with The Rock and Karl Urban.
Something which I watched once.
Yet in regards of the game... It's a linear shooter.
Which shouldn't be a problem as I really like linear shooters, but this one simply didn't do it for me.

It's a bit too plain for my taste.

I had it installed for a few months and 3.7 hrs was all I could get out of it.


Then suddenly the game received BIIIIIIIIG multiplayer updates, that got even forced onto people who couldn't care less about some dumb multiplayer mode.
Yet as I already struggled with singleplayer being not really entertaining for me, I uninstalled it and haven't touched it since then.


So for what the game costed, it's surely worth a thumbs down as it failed in entertaining me.
Which is the sole purpose of a video game.

But that's just my own taste it didn't fit with."
this game dose not have much to offer to be honest. its a little slow and it gets boring pretty easily. honestly its a 6.5/10. not worth it unless its on sale.
Boring.
It was pretty boring. I expected a little bit more from A game called Doom. The only Real fun parts of the game were the bosses and there were barely any of them. Not to mention the ending was about as good as the ending from the original Borderlands Which was pretty dull.
"The combat was great, but the lack of any other systems made it get repetitive before I beat it. Don't regret the time I played it for, but I won't finish it"
"Having clocked tens of thousands of hours on the original DooM games, I've tried this one many times since its acquisition but it just cannot keep me playing.

The shooting isn't very interesting and relatively easy. Using the simple gun is all you need most of the time in ""Normal"" difficulty.  I keep hoarding ammo always expecting a big fight, but nothing ever comes.

The most difficult part of the few ""challenges"" so far was to wait for the next loading screen.
It's simple : the ""platforming"" is the biggest killer so far.

There is also a multiplayer mode but that again was a disappointment. Instead of the raw brutality of DooM, ""victims"" (and maybe other players at some point, it's a bit fuzzy) get tracking and other ""cheat"" perks.
I guess it's nice if you aren't very good at this and want to have some kills but it feels cheap.

There are way better games for high-speed gunning raw violence."
"Not deaf/HoH accessible in the slightest - subtitles are only for cutscenes, and do not provide in-game support for enemy noises, etc. Very unfortunate since this looks like a fun game otherwise."
terrible game
Unskippable cut scenes. One-way maps (can't backtrack to look for secrets etc). Overcomplicated weapons system. Visual mess. Dehumanization
"People often criticised me for this opinion, but I think people are more willing to hear it now that hype isn't such a factor. This game while a good FPS, and probably the best FPS we've had in awhile, is not a good Doom game. Certainly it's better than Doom 3, and makes a much better attempt even at capturing what Doom (1993) felt like, but nonetheless it falls short and there are a few things I really take issue with.

Nu-Doom is rather slow, sure it's fast, but the game never once is moving at the pace of it's 1993 predecessor. In the original Doom you would find yourself flying down hallways at blinding speed cutting down everything in your path. Nu-Doom both has the character physically moving slower as well as slowed down the overall pace of gameplay. They have done this by introducing glory kills, which especially on higher difficulties, become absolutely mandatory to maintain ammo and restore health, as pickups are not enough, these animations break the pace of gameplay even if sped up, making us stop our rampage to watch a two second cutscene. They also rather than having maze like maps requiring keys where you tear through enemies all the way through. Nu-Doom has you go between empty to nearly-empty hallways, to enter an arena, in order to fight waves of enemies, to enter another hallway, and repeat the process. This loop is nothing like the original Doom and ruins part of what gave the original it's energy. Finally the weapons in Nu-Doom do considerably less damage than their 1993 counterparts in which many could tear down enemies in a single shot or less than a few seconds. In Nu-Doom we find fights with enemies lasting a bit longer, taking more hits, and ending with glory kills.

A side complaint is Nu-Doom is not storyless, though it is story minimal. Really though it has a story and isn't different from many other shooters. This is extremely annoying, the original Doom's story amounted to nothing more than some text at the end of an episode. This may also contribute to the slower overall pace of the game.

Finally the limitations on and subsequent lack of community made content puts the final nail in Doom 2016's coffin, Doom 1993's ability to be modded and it's modding community alone are what had given it's staying power on top of an already solid core game. To this day one could spend thousands of hours alone just playing through community made content for classic ID software shooters.

The game is by no means terrible, but it isn't anything like the original Doom. If you want a game that captures that classic FPS energy I recommend playing something like Devil Daggers or DUSK."
"It failed to draw me in. I just didn't care. It did not give me adrenaline, sense of achievement, any intrest in the story. The weapons felt akward, arenas - small, battles - repetitive and not satisfactory.

Yeah, nice graphics..."
"I decided to give this game a shot after hearing lots of people sing its praises.  After almost an hour of play, I decided to quit, as there was nothing really keeping me playing.  The gameplay was lackluster (Games like Destiny 2 and Overwatch have much better moment-to-moment gameplay), the story was virtually nonexistent (Though maybe I didn't give it enough time), and even their main new thing - using melee finishers to get health back - didn't feel polished in my opinion."
"I would have recommended this game, but the last boss cannot be killed by a lot of players, including myself.  You wipe out his hp, then he just sits there.  Looks like this has been a bug since the game was realesed."
"(1 playthrough completed on Nightmare difficulty)

All style ZERO substance.

The first few hours of this game were great. Amazing visuals, great music, cool atmosphere, and a likeable character to play. After a few hours you realise that this is it. There is nothing more to the game. After level 3 you have pretty much everything you're gonna use, and have seen pretty much everything. All that changes is a slightly fatter enemy type joins the endless hordes you have to fight. Level upon level of  this:
Walk a few paces -> Fight horde -> Checkpoint -> Repeat.
This is NOT how OG Doom used to be and seeing as I sincerely hope Eternal is NOT following in this games footsteps for gameplay. I was so SO bored of walking into a room, the room being sealed due to ""Demonic Presence"", killing everything in the room to open the door and repeat. The levels are all so similar. The ""arenas"" you fight in are all so similar. It was just so boring from midway onwards. 

When I buy a game I like to be able to sit and put hours into it and really get into the game. This games repetitive nature does NOT allow this. If you are going to play this game do no more than 2 levels a day. That way the monotony might not seem as stark. Even the music repeats itself throughout the game. They couldn't even take the time to put different music to different maps.

4/10 and thats being generous."
"Thanks Bethesda for ruining Doom. Just your name on it alone is a curse.
Not even the flash of fatalities (a gimmick which is just repetitious) could convince me to keep this game. I only spent ten dollars and I'm getting a refund. If I want Doom, I'll play 1, 2, 64 or 3. Also, you triggered fan boys whose only experience with adrenaline is the feeling they get when they play this game can go fuck yourselves back into that stinky hole your mom calls her birthing canal. Thanks."
"Pleasant at the beginning, I quickly realised how repetitive the gameplay was. Very painful to finish. I've never played a Doom before, so the magic of nostalgia couldn't work on me."
Just purchesed the game and can't even start as engine crashed. Can not even sent a report as the system not allow to upload the information. Very disapointed I have also bought Doom Eternal - hope that will work!
shit
"Overall grade: 4/5 in general, 1/5 with the present audio mixing.

Bought this game for 9,99€ on a sale based on a bunch of recommendations from friends. After approximately 40 minutes of decent gameplay, I had to put this down for good.

On the positive side, this is a competent shooter with a completely fine general feel of gameplay. The starting weapons are well selected in that they incentivize close-range gameplay that naturally teaches the player to use the glory kills. The music is good, and the game looks pretty enough (even if all the environments kinda look samey).

At the same time, the secret searching facet seems to be greatly at odds with the basic premise of high-octane gun-running gameplay. If you are the type of player that feels a need to find all secrets (especially when presented with a goal to do so), it'll probably get old rather fast.

But the most major problem, and the reason I had to put the game down, is the general sound design. In brief, the basic zombies (""Possessed"", or whatever they are called) are so unreasonably loud compared to all other sound sources, I had to either lose all other sound (including audio logs) or feel physical pain from the loud screeches. In brief, the sound mixing is simply unacceptable. If you are fine with missing the audio logs (and most of the other audio), then you'll do fine: just bump the music on high and the other sound effects rather low. If you are not fine with that, then I really can not recommend this game."
"Arena shooter, very action packed and fun for the first couple of hours a bit of a chore after that.

The originals and doom 3 were a lot better."
"I beat an entire bossfight, just to not get a checkpoint then have another one."
i don't own this game
cant even fix the mouse :)
"Get it on a sale if you must, nothing grabbed me, nothing hooked me, boring."
this is the most overrated game I've played in my entire life
"Boring and repetitive. Enter a level, shoot all demons got to next area to do the same."
404 doom soul not found.
"This game is a bug! It took me 90 hours to figure out that everytime you click ""Restart Mission"" it will wipe out about 80% of all achievements you've got on previous missions! Hell no I am going to go through all this crap again!"
"I’ve been playing FPS games since Wolfenstein 3D hence apparently this new iteration should’ve amazed me. But it doesn’t. It bore me to death. Man, these ultra super state-of-the-art graphics are so f****** soulless. Go play some (GZDOOM) mods instead such as Brutal Doom or somethin’."
"There is a lot of good to be said about this game, but the achievements and collectibles are what ultimate kill this game for me.
They are very front and center and in direct opposition to the game flow and just general enjoyment of the game.

Let the secrets be secret and the achievements be actual achievements, not a boring laundry list I have to grind through to level up my character."
good game
Its crashes alot
"NOPE. DO NOT BUY.
All the difficulty levels are set far too high, the game does not improve and becomes very boring purely due to difficulty.
After 3 hours challenges become impossible at all levels.
Save your money, get Wolfenstein."
"it was ok but if you want to shoot enemies just play quake, way more satisfying killing real players than ai. the guns feel similar to quake and i imagine the satisfaction comes from the same repetitive gory execution animations on bots and the gore explosions but this gets old pretty fast

not worth though, just play quake and airshot with the rocket launcher for a way more entertaining experience.
only buy this if you can't compete in games like quake or other fps games and dont understand that satisfaction"
"This game is full of cheap deaths from enemies that spawn directly on top of you, irritating jumping puzzles, and enemies that are practically invincible unless you have the right weapon mod to defeat them.  Compared to the original Doom, there is no ""shoot at it until it dies"" in this game.  There are very particular weapons and strategies that you need to use to defeat specific enemies, which on paper sounds good, but in practice just turns the entire game into a sisyphean task of fighting and dying repeatedly.  At least in that respect, I suppose it's a pretty accurate representation of hell."
exited the game and it made all of my shortcuts clump in one spot. fuck you too bethesta
"If you wish to slay demons. Doom 95 and Doom II gives more demons to kill. If you wish to practice platforming this is for you. I'm so sad that game turns from FPS to platforming. When you play campaign most of your time goes jumping and searching secrets and that is really sad.

Even if you skip the searching for secrets you still spent most of your time jumping around, not killing demons.

I love multiplayer in this game but its dead."
"i mean i woudl recommend this, as it is one of the most fun games ive played, but cannot as the game crashes at a specific point, and ive been able to find no solution."
"Wtf are you crazy with that reviews? I play it in 2021 and still totally buggy. I didn´t expect much from it (just good old-school 3D shooter), but it's a boring and stereotype slasher with no point, no story, no atmosphere. Glory kills have good animations, but after 100 times (it means after 120 enemies) It looks like middle cost fighting simulator. I like Wolfenstein so I would be willing to give It another chance...but It will crash after few minutes of playing. Sorry Beth, not for me."
shithole game
"The game is alright, but not amazing like you would expect. I think the environments are too bland and theres too much orange color grading which makes it hard to navigate the maps (everything looks the same). The gameplay is repetitive as fuck. Not as good music as doom 1. Some mobs are annoying and never die unless you empty your entire inventory of ammo..

It's far from what the original game was in terms of feeling. I'm sure that's intended, why make the same game repeatedly? But they shouldn't have moved away from winning concepts.

It's kinda how like half-life 1 was alot cooler than half life 2. They tried to evolve the game into something it wasn't. Sure many people did like that. This is just my personal opinion."
Pretty good but the doom guy's were quite hard to find and it's a lot of repetition for me.
"Doom isn't a terrible game, it's a decent FPS with nothing revolutionary or but implementing what it has decently. Where the game bugs me, is in the achievement department. If you want to get 100% get ready to grind, plan correctly because some achievements need time (multiplayer achievements where it seems the community has some weird hack at the moment of writing (uzi rocket launcher etc). And one major bug for The Circle is the Complete plan plan plan. Don't get any rune outside the mission arcs or you have to like me delete your safe files and play it all clean again.

not a good game
"70gigs cuz id are dog rear at managing the content
dont give us massive texturefiles intended for the next trillenium
stop giving us dog stern raw audio files
just STOP.. you're supposed to be ID dog nagit.
Of course I'd recommend it, it's doom. dermateets."
Strafe Left: the Game.
grim compared to eternal
I hate level select games.
overhyped big wow visuals for big stupids
games fun and cool but the saving system SUCKS i hate it i was nearly done then my save file got corrupted fuck u id!!!
"This PC port is garbage.
1) My sound is just gone. At least when I'm using bluetooth headphones. The game isn't outputting sound, and while it's open, nothing else on my computer has sound either.
2) Even in borderless windowed mode, this game refuses to let me go to be desktop.
3) Why on earth are settings tucked away in starting a new save file
I was really looking forward to trying this game, but I guess I'm not allowed to. Thanks.

EDIT: After fiddling with a ""Handsfree Telephony"" option in the depths of my computer, and restarting, I now have sound. So that's good. It's still shoddy that this is a problem in the first place, and it's still annoying that the application window refuses to play nice, and that settings are tucked under starting a new file.

EDIT 2: I'm mid game and it plays beautifully. Really enjoying my time. However while I DO recommend this game, I'm not changing my recommendation vote. If you want to fiddle with computer settings to get it to work properly, be my guest. I know this is just 0.00001% of reviews in a sea of reviews. But hey, might as well serve whatever warning I can."
The art and music is amazing but the gameplay feels bland. Your shots don't have any weight or chunkyness to them and so it just feels like you're shooting paper balls at enemies. Tried to play it back when I recieved it in a Humble Bundle and still can't play it in 2021 lol
"This game was way too repetitive . People say doom eternal is even more repetitive . If anyone has paid over $6.00 for this game , i feel sorry for you. It's very underwhelming. By the 3rd chapter out of the total 13 chapters you've basically seen everything in the game. Note that the game only has 3 bosses so yea that was a huge let down. Same animations over and over. This was my first and last doom game ever. Its very mediocre."
T'wasnt very fun. Run and kill big monster does get boring after not too long this game is actually carried by the soundtrack which i'll admit slaps hard. Meh game. 5/10
"0/10

i was with my mum at st vinnes, and then this doom guy (a.k.a ig fat green hulk cock man) was standing right nezt to her. then she gave him a blowgun and we went to gfo rAPE THE DEMOSN!!!!!! i wqas getting hurttting because i got hurt....

but then dante and jesse filipino twins came and...... rescued,............ then we killed all of them!!! and won filipino!!!!"
The game does not launch and all of the information they gave to fix the launching does not work and you can try to fix it yourself in files and downloading things off the internet or you can wait for a patch from bethesda with i would not count on anymore
the challenge for boost ammo is to hard
"Don't buy this game, buy the second instead.

wheetween giving a thumbs up or thumbs down I would like to give a neutral review but as I can't...

As of actuall shooters movement is slow, feels like you are a brick shooting. After clearing a map in some minutes it's a desert and the only thing left is to explore for items, but the maps are boring, all like jump here ""you jump you'r smurt"".

The enemies are dumb, it feels like it should be orde-game like but nop, first is all heavy metal-adredaline rush but after one or two minutes, when they are dead there is silence... and exploration... for toys... it contrasts too much with the action vive of the game. 

Somewhat it doesn't have the essence of the original DOOM, it feels more like another bethesda wolfenstein. The weapons are unoriginal the B.F.G. is a B.F.Shit there is no need or place to use it, the only thing relatively good is the chainsaw but instead off being a melee is a powerup item that needs gas, is all shoot, shoot and again... The demons are boring there is no feeling of fighting evil is the same as fighting babies, even the crippled old lady from the story is more badass than the demons.

The only difficulty is finding ammo... but actually there is so much ammo there is no difficulty and you get like infinite ammo from mid game...

Overall gameplay gets repetitive fast and the game is sort of short but it doesn't feel short because is gets so repetitive you gonna wanna drop it as soon as able. The problem been the game don't have propper escalation in action, as from the beggining tries to be full hardcore-non-stop but it fails because the demon/zombies are easy-dumb, there is no variety in gameplay, plus the flaw in design that cuts the action to search for colectibles/upgrades and power ups. cutting the gameplay inhigh and low peaks

Honestly my problem with the game is it borrows its identity from a classic title but it's not at the level it needs to be the susesor or remaster of such a legend (I know most doom sequells didn't make it) and it didn't bring anything new from the current generation besides graphics.  If it would have a different name/title/IP no one would recommend it or play it as it's a unoriginal generic shooter game with heavy metal but just super repetitive, this game would reach no where if it didn't stole the fan base of the legendary doom same as many other bethesda games like wolfenstein or prey.

TL;DR is a generic shooter game with heavy metal, it feels too repetitive. it should be called DOOM'b"
"Made me puke. If you're sensitive to motion like me, don't bother.

I mean seriously, is all that shit flying through the air really necessary? None of it hits me. I don't take damage from it. It's just benign debris flying around in the environment. So upon first exiting a building and going outside, I had to quit.

See, it makes my vision disorient, I fall into vertigo and nausea, and then I cant play. So why do I have to see it? Fuck your warnings for people like me, because I played the original without issue. What your environmental coders have done is so non-essential to enjoying the game. You wasted your money paying someone to code that trash, and I wasted my money buying it. Here's a good guidance statement: the environment need not be so full of flying debris that in reality it would warrant eye protection."
"Game is really fun to shoot, rip apart demons, and lots of actions like that. So why do I dont like it? The maps is confusing as hell. Literally have to check my map every 2 seconds every time i go through a door."
"Can't play multiplayer because you need levels to be competitive, and the only way to get levels is to play public games, which puts you against people who are almost always maxed level who will murder you in a fraction of the time it takes you to kill them. That's if there's enough players to actually play with. They need to unlock all the level upgrades so that new players can compete."
sound doesnt work at all
"The maps are fucking confusing.
I really want to continue playing the game but its just annoying to have to go a long way just for a couple of kills."
no
repetitive and bland environments
"Music is the most important thing in a game,and here metalcore genre is not suitable for every moment but it should have been included only in the most excited scenes; this musical choice ruins playability quite a lot thus covering every moment of the game with ridicule; instead,it should have left room for a dark and ambiental soundtrack as in Doom 3.
Weapon sounds are unsuitable and undersized in both volume and timbric parameters.
Movements are too slow,you have the constant feeling of being ""trapped"".
Lobby turns private after 5 minutes,roughly the time needed to load the game and there's no possibility for other players to enter in-game.
Multiplayer is faster and survival mode is funny enough but no one currently plays it.
The two weapon limit is the coup de grace.


A potential masterpiece ruined by too many questionable choices and limitations.

mid as hell
"[h1]Easily one of the most mis-representative games ever.[/h1] The damage control the Catholic church is going to have to establish to combat this sinful mess is daunting.

First of all, demons. Not just any demons. Piñata demons! That's right, the God fearing Christian gamer is encouraged to rip open these demons with a chainsaw to extract ammo from them. Utterly outrageous nonsense. This isn't how you combat Lucifer's minions. You do it the proper Godly way. By exorcising them and then, if the possessed individual is underage, indoctrinating them into your organization before fondling their underwear. Encouraging people to rip and tear demons might give the awful impression that people can handle their own problems without the church monitoring everything they do! How naughty!

Secondly, the portrayal of corporations in this story is silly. The UAC has no control over anything, are directly ignored by the protagonist and are often used as the butt of a joke. Ridiculous! You can't encourage people to ignore the order of big businesses! Several businesses here in America are God fearing and amazing recruitment for our cause! Shame! Shame!

Third, the music. Awful, just absolutely awful. In addition to it being just ear grating techno nonsense, there are pentagrams in the sound files of the game's score! Shame! Shame! Mick Gordon is a confirmed satanist and deserves to be eaten alive by pigmy ants! No wonder his cursed nation of Australia is full of animals made in God's glorious image who want to eat you!

One shutters to imagine what purpose this title has outside of converting our vulnerable, beautiful, intelligent young generation who are chased by old and repressed priests into a bunch of Satanists! Or worse yet... PROTESTANTS! Avoid this game like the heresy that it is!"
"Horrible game. And this comes from a fan of DOOM games. This new one is the worst of all, even worse than DOOM 1. Yes, is has much improved graphics, but it's just a huge mess with way too much detail. Everything dirty, chaotic geometry, too much complexity. All places in this game give that sickening feeling that you have when you walk in a room and it's unbelievably messy and dirty and filthy, thousands of objects thrown all over the place."
Demons cant jump
game sucks i go to bed
"Its time for my doom review.
And its sitting in my steam library, gazing up at me with big soulful eyes like a puppy, and this review feels like I'm kicking that puppy right where it hurts

Right  the positives first.... its doom, the graphics are A+ on my rig, cant fault those, the sound...  it could be better but its right up there and lets you know you're in hell, weapons.....  big.. clanky... go boom a lot, plus can be modded, controls.. fluid and excellent(once you've set decent keybindings of course), enemies....  they're monsters.... and do doomy monstery things,especially if you let them,  AI is pretty good too.

So why do I rate this game so badly....  simple.... the insipid level design, there's no variety ... a bit of climbing/jumping to get through a section, followed by a pile of ammo and a gate to an open area that you know full well will close after you go through. followed by a wave of imps... then hell knight, a rev or 2....  something with a red laser cutter... and baron of hell.
And thats it......  wheres the fear?  wheres the armor/key pickup in the middle of a room that may/may not unleash hell... wheres the empty room  you search for the key/switch for door and get rewarded by being face to face with a monster? wheres the close corridors full of fast moving imps.?
In short , they missed out the very thing that made the original Doom so much fun.

Will I finish the game? more than likely.. on easiest settings and about to google 'god mode switch' 
And if I'd paid full price for it, I'd be very disappointed


Post script.
Completed the game, Review still stands.
Everyone involved with the production of the game gets an A+ apart from the map designers who should be taken out and shot."
No response to gaming mouse!
"The game play is fast, satisfying and fun, but the campaign was just way too short and I feel like it was not worth 25 dollars. The multiplayer is also kind of boring and I could not see myself being interested in it for longer than like 20 minutes. Overall decent game and fun story but way too short."
Pretty much a maze where you do violent things to demons and sometimes to finish a certain objective in my opinion.

This series is cringe and non-canon.
Boring game.
"I'm really not sure why this is considered a good shooter, there are numerous issues with it, in my experience. It honestly felt like a shooter which had been created by people who only ever heard about shooters but never played them.

Firstly, I felt the controls were really clunky. I tried both mouse/keyboard and controller and just hard a really hard time looking and aiming. I tried different sensitivities, acceleration high and low, and just could not get myself set up with something I was comfortable with. I had to turn the difficulty down -- not because I found the game hard, but because I found myself taking so long to get my aim right.

Secondly, for a linear shooter, I sure did spend a lot of time getting lost and wondering what it was I was supposed to be going to and doing. There were plenty of times where you get locked into a room and then the thing I was supposed to do next was meticulously go through all the consoles until I found the one that had a contextual prompt to unlock the next door. Why? What a waste of time. Furthermore, the contextual prompts themselves often only show when you stand on top of them and look straight at them. If you're gonna put redundant button pressing activities in your shooter at least make them big and glowy (or, better yet, just get rid of them or make your processes automatic).

FInally, for a shooter, there certainly is a massive over-reliance on meleeing / 'takedown' moves and conservation of ammo. Ammo is a scarce commodity and you spend a lot of time just using the basic starting pistol because you've either run out of ammo or want to save it for the harder enemies.

All in all, it just feels like they took a fun franchise and took all the fun parts out."
"Paid $60 when this came out. Might as well be called ""Glory Kill"" since all you do is melee execute almost every single demon in the game for some reason."
Hell No!!!
"I wanted to love this game but I just don't.
The first few hours were fun, with good action, nice daemon AI (the Imps have great mobility) and cool graphics.  But this game just gets boring…  The same monsters, a monotonous level design, gore-kills ad nauseum, very poor platform sequences, etc.
I loved the original Doom and played for hours on.  Hell, I still play it from time to time and don't get bored.  Doom 2016 just doesn't work for me.It's one of the very few games I purchased and didn't even care to finish…

Update: I did end up finishing the game.  I guess it’s a game I needed to play a few hours at a time because I quickly get sick of how repetitive it is, but it is not so bad."
"This game is awesome. Epic gameplay and even more epic soundtrack. 

Sadly I got booted out of single player mode when steam decided to disconnect. This game is protected by denuvo anti-tamper, and you aren't able to play SINGLE PLAYER MODE while offline. I'd consider a refund, but I'm already beyond the refund period. Make sure you check into DRM on games before you purchase them.

If you have bad internet, you won't be able to play this game."
This game runs like shit now ..where as before it would run decent/...fuck you bethesda and steam
"Really fun game, which I'd give 8/10 for if it wasn't for a corrupted save file twice. So I'm done with the game, after getting half way through the first time and onto the third level the second time. It's a bit of a deal breaker for me."

"I know a lot of people really love this game, but after giving it a second try (i dropped it after a couple of hours on the first try) I just can't keep playing it.

My main issues with the game is that it's an arena shooter, and i really don't like those, it's just one closed arena after another with waves of enemies, that gets boring pretty fast, also it has the worst addition ever to any FPS, the fucking glory kills, because QTE are fun right?

The gunplay is fun, the movement is ok but I have the double jump and ledge climbing sucks, that alone with those glory kills ruins the flow of the shooting, also there are way too much platforming between ""arenas"", with no real enemies which just serves as a dumb intermission between fights.

The whole game has this very ""videogame"" feel to it, it has challenges, upgrades, secrets, another type of upgrades, ""trials"" which are just bonus stages with a lame reward, and some collectibles, at least to me all those things in a Doom game feels so weird and wrong.

The original 2 Doom games are classic retro FPS, with labyrinthic level design, secrets to be found (but in no way ""mandatory""), with clever enemy, ammo and weapon placement, not just some arenas with a bunch of enemies spawning one after another, to me at least are much better games, and this game really is something completely different.

In the end, I know a lot of time has passed since this game came out, but I know that to some of the fans of the original 2 Doom games this piece can serve as a warning before buying, it would have helped me at least"
trash
Doom eternal is galaxyes better than this
"Move to a room, get locked in, clear it, room unlocks, move onto the next room. 
This is literally the whole game."
Not enough killing demons. Too much fluffed gameplay.
could be better
"Amazing mechanics and movement. Boring Story, repetitive and frankly a chore to play through"
"Game is quite good, but random lockups and save file corruptions."
Game's rather boring :| And PvP just sucks
Mindlessly fun game but that annoying beep every time the player double jumps is enough for me to straight up stop playing entirely.
"As much as I like to Rip & Tear, this game has me in tears,
The game takes well over minutes to load, Huge load times, Corrupted save game files and what not.
You're better off getting a cracked version of this game. 

Steam Version - 6/10 | Cracked Version - 9/10"
"no online co-op, wtf. bad."
"Reviews mention how there is no story and how that doesn't matter in this game: it's one of those memes that keep popping up. Why then do you get stuck in elevators listening to godafwul exposition over and over again? I don't really understand the hype for the action either if I'm being honest. Not all that fun, this game!"
"Doom 2020 is one of my favorite games, so I bought this to fill my hunger for more doom and what an absolute shit fest this one is. Almost fell asleep on hard mode until they decide to ramp it up to fucking 11 at the very end on a level where you literally get stuck on everything."
"Do NOT buy this game. It started off an excellent looking game, which now I am unable to finish. First and foremost, I am not a great player and had this game set on the easiest setting. All was playing well until I reached the end of level baddie at the Necropolis (level 11 of 13). Let me explain ...

1) You CANNOT save this game manually. You have to rely on Checkpoints.
2) When you die, you go back to the start of that checkpoint.
3) I tried about ten times to beat the end of Necropolis, but always died.
4) So, I enabled the DEV CHEAT to get past that section.  This I did, and after reaching a new level exited the game.
5) Now, trying to reload that game, it says it is corrupted.

So, not only could I NOT save the game as I required, but its own save game facility has corrupted my ONLY save game when I went to load it.

A complete waste of time and money, as it was difficult for me to even reach the stage I had. I do not have the stamina to go through that again.

https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/33953/~/why-does-doom-keep-launching-in-developer-mode%3F"
"It's boring. Most of the time i'm running around looking for the door or the stupid parkour section i missed. fights are stupid, because you have to punch blinking enemies to get hp and chainsaw enemies for ammo. wtf?
Also dumb quicktime events and unskippable ingame sequences to tell boring story. The whole game feels too slow.
Game looks pretty good though and runs well."
Trash. Doesn't even start.
I can't play it without severe motion sickness.
"I'm not a man who enjoys playing first person shooters. They generally come down to the same generic formula of run and gun around the map, point, and click. So much so that they can be called point and clickers as interchangeably as FPS's. I consider these games to not really allow for much critical thinking beyond that or adaptability to different playstyles which I think a game should do, the one's I really enjoy the most are immersive sims and horror one's that actually force you to use your thought process and not pure instinct. 
Never the less I enjoy these kind of games as low class as they are. So I saw the game on sale and said ""Alright let's see how the successor to the original most influential fps plays.""
Big mistake, my most regrettable purchase yet, I might just start pirating games before buying them to see if they're worth spending money on after this.
Listen very carefully because I'm going to get to the point and explain exactly why I can't recommend this game:
It literally glitched out my save files.
This has never happened to me before, the worst thing close to this that had ever happened to me was looping myself in death because I autosaved while dying on the one save file I had while playing SS2. That was my fault, this wasn't. 
Bethesda games are glitchy in general sure, but this took the cake, I can handle dropping out of the map, I can't when I open up the game and see that I had been sent back in time all the way to where you meet the first Imp.
You had one job.
One job.
And you still screwed the pooch.
That's not just it though.
Doom isn't a conventional FPS because of glory kills, the game makes you spam the shit out of whatever key you binded them to to get health and supplies. Last I checked no other fps makes you focus on this.
The gameplay apart from that is your basic fps, run in an arena map for 5 minutes until everything dies, move to the next level. 
This isn't a plus or minus, it just means that the gameplay is literally meaningless here because you can get the same experience anywhere else. 
The story, oh God the story. Remember that Doom comic that was cartoonish in it's portrayal of Doom guy and how he was just some maniac obsessed with killing everything?  Imagine reading that and taking it seriously as something the fanbase enjoyed and wasn't just some ironic injoke. In the original Doom you were the last survivor of a horrible event, contrary to what the future games tell you, they're not locked in there with you, you're locked in there with them, Doom Guy, Gordon Freeman, Adrian Shepherd were all made badasses because they were normal people like you or me who pushed their limits to survive. Nowadays every single protagonist has to be a Jesus stand in who gets worshipped as the second coming from the start. Yeah Half Life 2 did it first but still they didn't hammer it in as hard as this, until Alyx.
Alyx lore wise just ruined everything but that's a whole other story.
Point being it's laughable that this became the actual story for Doom. 
Mick Gordon's soundtrack is great but all video game soundtracks are great, there's no shortage of musician majors who can't get jobs or make it as performers so they just compose video game music, even indie games have great orchestral scores now, if you think this is going to raise the games level in anyway it doesn't.
Going back the save file disappearance I have seen other games screw up with hitboxing and guns but never anything like this. The game fundamentally managed to fail at a formula that has already been set and one that sets the bar at the lowest in gaming. 
Given all these negatives with no real positives I'm going to just have to say the game isn't worth the buy. 
Go buy Deus Ex, or System Shock, or even the original Doom even if it costs as much as this game does on sale. It's not worth the buy."
Extremely boring game. Finished campaign. Spent most of the time spamming the Glory Kill to watch the same 2 animations on each enemy. Waypoint system isnt great either.
"every aspect of this game is Incredibly underwhelming, this would be a passable game at most IF it was priced at 4 Pounds/Dollars"
"Not violent enough.
This is not a gag."
"Not my cup of tea.  Dark, disorientating and didn't enjoy the game play at all."
Terrible slow thru steam
"It's got a lot of the classic Doom flavor. (Although not as much of the sheer inanity that they managed to sneak into Doom Eternal.) However, I didn't find myself really enjoying the gameplay or the story all that much. (Possibly because there is a story now, and it hinges around the moral ambiguity of solving an energy crisis with Hell-demons.) I guess the Glory Kills are a neat touch.

Between this and Doom Eternal, Eternal offers a more robust experience built around much of the same material. (And aside from knowing a little bit about the UAC and Doctor Hayden, you don't miss much.) If you're going to play both, play this first; the story is continuous. Doom Eternal just has more gymnastics and wall climbing. If you're not going to play both, play Doom Eternal. 

Since each one is about 60 gigs, maybe only install both at once if you have a pretty big hard drive."
"This is Doom for the modern gamer, that doesn't actually like old school shooters. It's painfully new-school, uninspired; You can tell that it was designed to use naive gamers as a conduit for hype.

Any claims that this is an ""authentic"" or ""evolved"" Doom game is a smokescreen. If you actually want authentic, buy a New Blood game instead."
"I find this game boring. Levels look the same, enemies are mweh.. jsut press f to fuck them up... nope."
Game is fast past and has an old school feel to it. But the game is just killing the same hordes of demons over and over again in different rooms. I had some problems where demons would teleport and get stuck inside walls which forced me to reload a check point and the single player crashed once with a disconnection error.
"You could remove a lot of its parts and it would still work fine. I don't really see the pure ""RIP AND TEAR"" experience others had with it."
You cannot eat food
"not my bag, gore is lame and cliche, great story telling if you like mind-numbing brain hurting lame and cliche yeah"
i have a nightmare from this game scary oh no
"Hoped it's more like Doom2 (more shooting, less searching), but it's like Doom3, but less scary."
"I really enjoyed this game but I am going to not recommend it because there is a bug related to a certain achievement that still has not been fixed since its release in 2016. this bug was acknowledged by the developers a few weeks after release and they said they were going to fix but have not done so. 

Absolutely worth buying if you don't care about achievements."
"personally, I like bashing demon skulls into walls as much as the next guy but after not too long of playing it got really repetitive.

Sure I could have done the challenges or look for the collectibles but that just makes it even more boring, I've already play the game through on switch so maybe that's why I found it boring to play through it again but to me at least i got desensitized way too quickly and it has long fights multiple times with little cut-scenes or breaks between. 4/10"
"No manual save/load, only checkpoints. Died once? Go play most of the level from the start.
Want to try another approach and died again? Go play most of the level from the start.
Faced boss and died? Go play from the level start."
"The game was ok until level 89 then it locked out/froze and would not go to any other level in fact the whole program stopped responding, tried to uninstall and reinstall in steam to no avail, somewhat frustrating with nowhere to go to fix what ever the problem is"
"Game is fun and everything but is poorly optimized, it keeps crashing. I have brand new custom made PC, so the only reason left for crashing is poorly developed game. I wish i could take my money back.."
"Combat is propped up by a repetitive glory kill mechanic that takes me out of the action and ruins immersion. The controls are clunkier than the original Halo, things like ledge grabs seem to only connect half the time. Only an hour in and I'm spending minutes walking to 30 second combat encounters against uninspired enemies that die to bullet spam (playing on medium difficulty btw)."

"To difficult on the easiest level. If I wanted difficult I will play the harder levels. I play for fun not to be annoyed. Game does not allow invincibility or unlimited ammo. Getting past the ""Argent Facility (destroyed)"" is not fun... so the game is gone and am not planing on getting any future versions of Doom again. Not for me."
"I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend this game based on something as random as video settings. It sounds silly but I just cannot LOOK at the game comfortably. Borderless window mode doesn't actually work - the game still takes overlay priority over other windows I have open that are supposed to show up over the game.  Windowed mode takes the resolution you specified but shrinks the sides and the bottom. I don't want to play full screened if I'm supposed to have 2 other options.

In-game HUD and subtitle text are somewhat blurry even with sharpness all the way up. It drove me nuts. Actual enemies and objects looked okay.

The soundtrack was hype though."
"4/10

got soft-locked in mission 10 and the game isn't fun enough to replay the entire mission again so fuck off"
"I find this version of Doom to be disappointing and quite boring. I much prefer Doom 3 over this version. This has nothing in the way of story compared to it. All you do is jump from one arena to the next to the next ad nauseum. 

Olivia Pierce is barely a Villain and Samuel Hayden guiding you along is annoying at best. 

That's not to mention all the technical problems I have just getting it to play. Frequently the audio will just cut between loading screens, I have to switch the Resolution from 1440p to 1080 in Windows before I launch the game otherwise it'll freeze and then I get random freezes for no reason causing me to have to reboot my entire system.

Never had an issue playing an older game on modern hardware as I have with this. Got it because I eventually wanted to play Doom Eternal and this is its predecessor.

The RPG elements when it comes to upgrades feels tacked on and really don't belong in a Doom game. Collectible figurines add nothing besides bragging points for completionists.

Already uninstalled and I'll be skipping Eternal."
holy shit i remember playing this game and it was fun but if you have played into the game atleast 30 hours you see alot of the problems the first one is that there is no sort of invulernability after getting a glory kill so that can make the game much more frustrating due to the enemies firing fireballs or rockets at you to only hit you right after you finish a glory kill and sure im not someone who plays fps games alot but i know that good ones have way less issues then this i hope that if you are buying this you know just how dogshit the mechanics for this game are thank you for reading my review
This is one of the most fooouuooocking pointless games i've every played in my life. Its hypnotic in the worst possible way. You do the same crap over levels of repetitiveness for 7-16 hours. Its just like what Mack said from WAB: A mindless shooter. Repetitive = Chore = Bad.
"- Very good game!
- Has in-game Ads."
"Used to be a great game, then some update made controller impossible to use, with motion sense as if it was some kind of VR thing, making aiming a chore."
"Bad level design, boring action. It's more about searching where to go than actually shooting enemies."
Spend  most of time walking around
"This was my first Doom game after hearing about it, so I had very high expectations, which means I was naturally disappointed. I would have refunded the game, but I got it dirt cheap on the winter sale, so I don’t care.

+The music is pretty nice I guess. I'm partial to orchestral music in games, but I can appreciate this too. 
+The glory kills are kinda satisfying.
+The game looks very beautiful, even on lower settings. 
+The demon destruction physics are super good.

~The guns are pretty unique, but only after you upgrade them. Until then, they feel very similar.
~The runes make for good extra perks, but the rooms you have to complete aren’t even remotely challenging. It would be much better if you just got them straight away.

The gunplay is terrible. I'm gonna break it down into a few parts:
-I hate that I can't reload. For me, it breaks the flow of the game, I need some way to ""recenter"" myself, break the fight into multiple parts instead of one big one and actually enjoy it, instead of rushing through it.
-For some reason, there’s no ADS. Only a single weapon has a zoomed sight. I miss like 60% of my shots because my gun is always on my hip.
-The encounters are very fast and very short. There are also huge intervals in between them, especially paired with the ""secrets"". There aren't any “just wandering"" enemies spread out on the map.
-The fight begins incredibly epic, one guy versus the horde. But always ends with one little shit, stuck in the geometry of the level.
-The guns all feel very weak, it always takes so much more to kill something than I think (I played on medium difficulty). Also if I’m the Doom hunter shouldn’t I have overpowered weapons? 
-There is no reward after the fight, not even spawned armor for example, if you kill everything. At that point, the fights feel like an annoying obstacle more than fun.
-The game boils down to just shoot an enemy with your peashooter out in the open until you can glory kill them and then move on to the next enemy. That’s the entire gameplay loop, it doesn’t change at all.  

My other criticisms:
-The “secrets” aren’t secret, you can see them on your map when you get close. They’re really more “points of interest”.
-The “POI” are really the main reason why I got bored so quickly. To get better weapons, you need to collect them, which makes a game that’s already heavily segmented feel even more so. They often require a lot of going outside the mainline of fights, where there is nothing at all. 
-The map is garbage, especially on levels that have multiple floors.
-The environment is uninspired and doesn’t change, it’s all just a generic industrial base. 
-The parkour, or more specifically mantling is very random. Sometimes you can’t make trivial jumps and other times you make a jump when the platform is a meter above you.


TL:DR: The game looks nice, but starts getting boring after just a few minutes when you get the basic gameplay loop. There’s no ADS or reloading. The fights are short and have a lot of time between them. IMO I would say that this game is insanely overrated for how much hype it gets.

TL:DR the TL:DR: This game is basically the boring 18+ version of Ratchet and Clank."
I want DOOM to be a shooter; I just don't get on with the melee / glory kill focus.
"It's atmospheric and the theme is amazing but it feels repetitive and tiresome to me, I wouldn't recommend it based on that."
Locked at 60 FPS...
its fun until like 6 hours and then it gets kinda bland
"Other people obviously like this game and this is a classic game that anyone calling themself a ""gamer"" should at least attempt to experience but personally i found it bland and boring. Game play is ok and the story is fine but the art style is next to non existant and everything kinda blended together so nothing really stood out too much. Sorry"
honestly I had high hopes for this game but it constantly freezes in the loading screens Its super annoying because the actual game is fun but I constantly have to restart my pc
"Like someone said: Either you fall in love with this game or you stop playing it immediately. It's very much down to personal taste.
So many people claim it's the best shooter evar but no-one mentions that it's so very, very, very obviously a console, not a PC game. I'm not exaggerating when I say everything about this game feels console to me. ""What's the difference between a PC and a console game"" you ask? It's the difference between Deus Ex 1 and Deus Ex 2.
So if you love simple, action-packed pseudo-oldschool shooters and don't mind console game UI, console game world design, console game weapon design and feel and console game arcade-y gameplay on your PC, you'll probably love it. Reminds me of the recent Wolfenstein 1 & 2, which everyone claimed were the best FPS evar too and when I played them on PC I though: ""These games are good, but if you claim they're the best evar you obviously never played a shooter that was made for PC instead of consoles or multi-platform (which is another word for console-first)"".
If you're an oldschool PC gamer like me and don't like giant-ass crosshairs on monster size weapons and gamepad-focussed UIs and menues, learn from my mistake and don't buy this game and then wait a month before you actually play it so you can't get a refund if it turns out that you're just not the target audience for this simple console arcade shooter."
"I'm sure this game is great, and I would actually kill a person to play it but sadly, whatever copy of DOOM I got is completely broken. I can't get past like the first two minutes of gameplay without it freezing or crashing. Iv'e reinstalled multiple times, Iv'e done basically all I can at this point. I'm sure I would love it if I got to play it but I can't recommend something that is undoubtedly broken. :("
"So far when I try to restart every single saved game it comes up as a corrupted file. I don't have time for this crap. I'll still play it, but it's a few bucks I'll never get back. Recommend it to other players? No way."
Doom eternal ripoff
multiplayer dead
"I've spent 14 hours in this game but have never gotten that far into the game due to my saves corrupting eventually every time I try to play. Honestly, this game is really good. However, it keeps crashing on me and subsequently corrupting my saves.  I've tried my hardest to try and fix these issues, because I have had a good time in the parts of the game I've experienced. Nothing's worked however, and honestly I've given up and chalked it up to a hardware problem. I've had a bittersweet experience with this game, but it doesn't mean that you'll have the same one as me. I can't personally in good faith give it a recommendation, but you'll probably have a good time with it. Pick it up, but be wary of any issues you may face."
"Game worked for a total of two days with about 2ish hours spent playing Campaign. Now it doesn't even launch, showing only a fullscreen black screen and displaying as ""Not Responding"" in task manager. Waste of money."
"I played Doom growing up, and I saw how highly rated this game was, so I bought it a while ago. I don't get what all the hype and excitement is about, it feels like a pretty formulaic shooter where you navigate labyrinth levels, do some first person jumping puzzles, then have big set piece battles with a variety of weapons and enemies. Certainly a polished game, but also kind of boring (the same formula for almost 30 years). Maybe I was just expecting something more or different, but I kept waiting for the fun to happen and for the game to get it's hooks in me."
Game is really good but for some reason my save files keeps getting corrupted and game crashes.
"PROS:

Runs incredibly well, was able to maintain a consistent ~160FPS on max settings at 1080p.
Looks pretty good.

CONS:

Rather short campaign.
Boring core gameplay loop.
The music gets annoying after a while.

But the real reason I leave a negative review is the excessive amount of bugs I encountered in the last two levels of the game, which completely soured my otherwise ""not for me but a decent game"" sentiment. Almost every surface or staircase was causing a huge snag (or sometimes causing a physics glitch that made my character catapult as if I used a jump pad) and even locking me in place at times. Additionally, finishers were causing me to fall through the map or also get stuck in place.

For those reasons I cannot recommend this title, as these bugs became easy to reproduce and hard to avoid at what would be well past the point of a simple Steam refund in terms of hours played."
T
Lame and boring. Wasn't a big fan of the original Doom back in '93 but it was a must back then.
"i hope eternal is better than this sh*t, so boring one of my easiest refunds"
"what do you get when you take repetitive gameplay, uninteresting story, and one dimensional characters mixed with gay ass dubstep music in the background? this GARBAGE!  seriously, what happened to blasting some Slayer like a real man???? not only are the guns unrealistic (shotguns don't have infinite ammo and you need to reload guns to shoot them), it lags my computer too! ridiculous!"
"I love everything about the DOOM franchise, but the game just doesn't launch.
I don't know how to fix it, it's unplayable."
"So, I'm revising this review from when I first tried DOOM (when I noted that I found it unplayably hard due to its ""getting into the middle of things"" game design). I've come back to it, and managed to get through the first few missions - 3 hours of gameplay - and.... well, it's still not exactly great.

I'm still not a fan of glory kills - there's much better implementations of the risk/reward system in other games - and I'm not really a fan of the level design principles either (""lets lock people into a series of small arenas or pseudo-arenas"" and ""lets have a lot of *very rectangular* corridors which you can only find your way around because they put green lights on where you should go"").  The combat is disinteresting enough to me that I tried the first Rune challenge once, shrugged and couldn't be bothered to try it again - it doesn't help that Runes were yet *another* upgrade point system on top of the, what, three that already had been introduced? 1 upgrade point system, sure. 4 seems like carelessness.
And the fact that you're locked into a checkpoint system with no free saves and yet the game wants to try to get you to explore to find secrets - which could involve attempting jumps that would kill you and... send you back to a checkpoint nowhere near where you'd gotten to - is baffling.

The music's great, but I'm going back to Quake."
"game is not compatable with my system. spent 6.3 hrs trying to fix d problem. 
it launches but crashes b4 d game loads up."
Miss sniper-style gameplay. You can only play in brutal close in style.
"updated this review after a few years, game kinda sucks actually, want to get into it but just cant, play doom eternal"
Can not get game to run. All I see is black screen with 99% at top right. Music plays in background
"my computer crashed [spoiler] when I got back to the hell 3rd time [/spoiler] and now my file is corrupted. I don't want to spent another 15 hours to get back to the point I was.

can not even import savefiles and use mission select"
I could hardly play the game because I kept headbanging to the music 0/10
"I somehow failed to enjoy this game at all, I was just bored from beginning to end. I might be broken."
"i will now list everything wrong with the game that i have found so far:
1: bethesda touched it
2: inconsistant/borderline non-existant hitboxes makes game frustrating at best and unplayable at worst
3: the map design looks amazing but is almost impossible to navigate without a qualifaction in navigation
4: the UI is garbage and pisses me off just a persinal thing i hate how you have to navigate it
5: glory kills give fuck all hp back there is bassicaly no point to using it since your more likly to burn through more hp getting to the enemy and stunning said enemy than your going to get back from the glory kill
6: the maps are a pain in the ass to move around and there is no soft vault at all so the slightest ledge will stop you in you tracks
good things:
1: a good sound track (dont bother getting the game just buy the soundtrack that is actually good)"
No saving possible. Checkpoints only. Game has a panicky feel without any of the DOOM DNA. This is not DOOM. Waste of money. Delete. Bye.
"It's very Quake style. Not really ""Doom-ish"" . If you like never-ending mass shootings for several hours - buy it."
"Absolute disappointment!
Cant understand the hype. Boring, linear, dull, clunky and repetitive...
Feels more like someone needed money and that, as fast as possible.
It had a potential but was just trashed. 
The map design looks cheap and the enemies animation and effects are just weird.
This sucks"
"Neutral review.

This is a great game ruined by bad UI. the waypoint system in this game is unintuitive at best and the maps it gives you to work with are not that much better. game pace is ruined when i have to scour empty rooms looking for a single key because the waypoint is telling me the actual door i need to go through is 4 rooms away from me through 8 walls for a good 10-15 minutes at a time. if nothing else, at least put the key icon on the minimap instead of the 30 random collectables i don't care about which all clutter the screen. Raw gameplay, this game is good though [shield enemies are obnoxious, but basically everything else i found to be okay]. Overall, the game's fine, but the map layouts and UI to match are just so god damn obnoxious."
"Finally decided to give it a try, and it's as bland and boring as I expected."
"This game made me feel as amazing as the original did.

But... then I played Doom Eternal, and I can't touch this one now."
"Kind of tedious.  When you get stuck there's no level select, few cheat codes.  Annoying checkpoint system that reeks of  being a console port."
i want a refund now. u took my money in a second u can put it back in a second. your game wont work. and that means a refund
"Broken buggy game with terrible movement, dumb ai, and boring encounters.
If you must play one of the new doom games get eternal as its somehow less buggy and broken than this piece of shit while still being terribly broken."
Big Dick and Balls
"Seriously overhyped, the game is fine I guess but incredibly repetitive and gets boring pretty quick. Despite all the ""intensity"" it really boils down to forcing a very specific playstyle that requires the player to shoot enemies a bit, then do a melee attack to finish them off (this is optional but you will quickly run out of health and ammo if you don't) resulting in the player watching the same animations over and over again while your control is pulled away so that doomguy can perform one of a handful of scripted animations. Levels look neat but aren't well designed and get confusing. 

Play Wolfenstein instead, same appeal, better game."
"I bought this game thankfully only for 5€. Friends of me were searching for a somewhat unreal tournament/quake 3 arena like feeling like in the good old days of multiplayer gaming. 

Well the first impression of the game was ok. Felt a little bit like an old style shooter but then came the downs...

- Complete senseless matchmaking. No filter for game type. We liked warpath the most as gamemode. But no filter for that. You can only filter for a pool of game modes where warpath for example is in, but it is possible that you will play the whole evening other game types. Great job devs.

- No balanced team joins or scramble. Well there is a server mode for the first 20 levels. That is a nice. And the games there were the most fun. So it was about the first 1 or 2 hours of the game. But after then, you do your first ""real"" games and gets thrown in against a clan team of fully max leveld ""super heroes"" with all weapons and stuff. Good luck with your first guns and 2 hours of map experience. 
What the hell were the devs thinking ? So you wonder why player count drops?
Well i tell you what, if every newcomer who maybe has a slight interest in the game, but only lands as cannonfodder (after joining a match with a gamemode he does not even want to play) because he has a job and does not want to get pulverized every 2 seconds from ""no job school boy who leveled the game 24/7"" then you can be assure the pleasure is somewhere at the bottom.

Imagine you learn to play chess, and you buy a chess game but the chess game puts you just randomly against players with hundreds of hours of gameplay. Will it be fun ? A newbie against Kasparov maybe ? Great idea. Great job again devs.

- No server browser is bad. But matchmaking without trying to balance teams is the worst you can do in a game.

- There are also more minor to medium ""issues"" which do not fit, like demons which are starting way to often, which leads to games where always a demon is on. Etc.

- You can also create own games, but then you can not select bots for every game mode.

- Instead of a sensible matchmaking or serverbrowser you get now experience points for achieve skins for your right arm or left leg(no joking). wtf ?

Like i said, for 5€ ok, played two evenings and good bye. Thank got i did not spent 40 or more for this dissapointment."
"Deleted hours of progress without reason, I never had that issue on console. It's nice that it loads fast but that doesn't make up for the time I'll have to spend redoing what it deleted. There's also oddly no fps option, and it's crashed numerous times for seemingly no reason. Once so bad I had to ctrl alt delete and sign out to force close everything because I couldn't click on anything on my desktop."
trash
"Game almost never loads fully, ryzen 5 2600 with kraken m22 runs 95c even at menu.  original doom you could play on any x86 system.  waste of money."
"Sry, for me I can't recommended this game.
I play it through and test the arcade mode, but none of these modes are quite fun for me.

Pros:
- Performance with activated vulkan api is awesome and very fluent
- Controls are absolutely perfect
- Not much time is spent to the weak story
- Sound, graphics and animation are very good

Cons:
- Gameplay is some kind of weak, because of the following game breaking issues:
- Gunplay, some weapons doesn't feel good and the impact feels not right
- Ammo, you have very restricted ammo, still in the arcade mode
- Wayfinding, you are always searching the next checkpoint and this means: walking, searching, looking at the map, walking, searching, and the whole thing from the beginning, until you find the trigger. This was one of the most annoying thing of the game for me.
- The second one is: Doom is an Arena Mode Game, an area is sealed until you killed the last deamon, which are spawning, it's a lame style to play a game and there is no other play mode.
- The monotonous music can be annoying, I finally muted it.
- Glory Kills, can disturb the flow of the game and for me they are annoying in this type
- The game is a little bit too fast to enjoy it

Well, everybody has to judge for himself. For me I have more fun with the classic doom games for myself and don't have the intension to play the sequel of this doom game."
im rash so i dont like jk i love dis game
"it crashed too much, I can't have a nice gaming session on it."
"I was thrilled, i bought this game and it was all good for 9 hours of gameplay, until i reach an area where there should be a big explosiong and... boom the game freezes everytime i get there, very disappointing"
"The game itself is great but I can't wholehearty recommend this game because the recent, very detailed event that Mick Gordon have provided to the public of how he got treated and have shed some light on his side of the story.

Marty need to get rip a new one"
save corrupted no fix thanks guys loved it a lot until this don't feel like putting another 8 hours in to get back where I was
The game crashes everytime I start it up. Once I load in I have no issues but as it boots its a gamble whether or not it'll work. The game itself is fun but I cant give a good review when it clearly seems to have many issues after looking online seeing how many people have this same issue four years after launch.
"GTX 1070, 48 gb Ram and AMD Ryzen 7 1700x @3.4 Mhz. Running 12-13 FPS. Are you kidding me? A year ago everything when smooth on ultra settings. Now, not even on Low Setting can I play this game..."
"I think the new Doom games are highly over-rated. I would have had so much more fun if this game had iron sights, and I didnt have to melee enemies for health. The OLD dooms are better in terms of just raw fun and door/key puzzles. I really wish they would have just made it like the OLD first 2 dooms, but with these new graphics, I feel like that would have been way more fun."
"bug infested piece of shit. i've been trying to solve the ""doom refusing to launch on my main screen"" problem for hours. I remember playing it. the game itself is not that bad. but these fucking bugs have me at my wits end."
it makes sense for me to put a bad review beaucause i have a terrible computer
"Extremely Boring, repetitive, predictable and confusing. Half the time you’re trying to find some keycard in a maze of copy and pasted rooms and half the time your having to glory kill some annoying imp that keeps spawning in over and over again. The weapons have hardly any ammo capacity and always run out of ammo extremely fast and don’t do hardly any damage. The difficulty settings are terrible, the game is either too easy or too hard. The menu makes no sense and the game tries so hard to have fancy graphics that half the time you can’t even tell what you’re looking at. 0/10, not worth being paid to play."
"Has women in it

0/10"
"from the little bit i played it did not grip me. I was playing a 2002 game called enclave before this (which never had high ratings btw) which is kinda similar in that you can shoot or do melee and imo way more fun. This seems more of a melee game than a shooter really. you stun your enemy by shooting it, walk up to it and rip its head off. looks cool on youtube but it did not make for a super satisfying gameplay loop. more fun melee systems have been done many times before.  Here It's like harvesting. instead of tomatoes, you are harvesting heads. also i did not really get the 'red planet' aesthetic of this game, despite the graphics being good. i might adjust my score later if and when i play more, but for now i cant recommend it."
Glory kills ruined the game.
"The glory kill system ruined this game for me. 

When I shoot a throw away enemy like a zombie or an imp at close range with the shotgun I want it to fly in five different directions not go into a awkward stumble animation, glow orange and then patiently wait for me to punch it. You can turn off the glow but not the mechanic.

The game already has an annoyingly small ammo pool. Leaving the player with the options of either watching the same boring animation again and again or wasting twice as much of their precious ammo.

I replay OG DOOM 1 & 2 all the time and have never wanted to replay this piece of crap.

Download brutal doom and have more fun for free than this can provide."
Poop
"I’m astounded how overrated and boring this game is.

Combat: Sparse ammo, meh weapons, meh enemies, forced melee (your shooting galore is interrupted every 5 seconds so that you perform a “glory kill” to regain health and/or ammo).
Level design: Maze > locked arena > maze > locked arena. No atmosphere or environmental storytelling whatsoever, just “compounds” and “facilities” with occasional (bad) platforming.
Story: There were NPCs spewing BS and I haven’t ever cared less.
Soundtrack: Some people say it’s “good” and “metal”. It’s neither good nor metal.

I’ve spent 4 euros to see what’s the hype all about and now I’m giving you this “avoid” lesson for free:)"
"I really liked this game until it randomly gave me a BSOD when I changed graphics settings and restarted. When I started the game again, the save was corrupted. I lost all my progress."
"this game crushes so much so i had to walk it through 3 times because 2 of my saves were corrupted during its crashes. i have to restart it after almost each load. no other game allows itself to behave same way. i am very-very disappointed in id software, their previous games had all pretty good quality. this is just glossy chinese shit"
It's dead.
no
"Game overstayed its welcome by 4-5 hours.
Please stop spamming my recommendations with Demon games, Steam."
"A neutral review rather than negative, singleplayer only.

✔️ High tempo music and bloody gore as expected
❌ Unbefittingly slow movement and weapons (unlike Quake games)
✔️ Great graphics, animations, physics
❌ Poor environmental variety

✔️ Melee kills are useful throughout the game (unlike Serious Sam 3&4) 
✔️ Good equipment implementation (recharging instead of pickups, separate from weapons) 
❌ Too few equipment types and weapons (unlike Shadow Warrior 2)
❌ Weapons lack impact (plasma rifle and rocket launcher) and it wasn't clear to me until the last level that half of them use the same ammo
❌ Power-up placement and visibility (80% of time I found those only after combat)"
"The in-game experience is pretty fun, and feels slick and polished. Overall real good gameplay. However, the crazy DRM, privacy policy and T&C's make this a hard product to recommend anyone. Put simply, they are unreasonable. 

As a funny example, if your steam name is 'ugly Gilgamesh' then you technically violate their code of conduct (username with offensive wording with a historical figure) and might lose access to the game if they choose to enforce their own policies -- which they will certainly do when it is convenient."
Still as glitchy as it was a launch.
"Punchy, satisfying, and gory game-play progresses into slow, boring monotony just before the 3rd act. 

Endless corridors of the same red and brown hues, with 1-dimensional enemies thrown at you in ever increasing numbers. 

Shared ammo meaning that you can never use your favourites for long enough, and under-powered starting weapons mean you are actually limited in what you can use. 

Add to that clunky platforming, useless suit upgrades, and a spattering of secret areas, which are the only thing remotely interesting about the later levels, you have a pretty ""meh"" game."
"Disapointingly lacking in content and replayability. Very few collectables, and the ones that do exist have no life to them. Its really quite disapointing and I very much regret spending my $20 on this. I thought it would have more content for how well it did back in 2016, but it seems I was mistaken. 
Some games I would reccomend. Rainbow six siege, great multiplayer shooter and you get more value for what you pay.
Binding of Isaac Rebirth, tons of content and literally the most replayable game ever being a roguelike.

Really a shame, glad most of this was fixed in the sequel but there is absolutely no point in buying or playing doom 2016 in 2020 unless you have an obsession with challange runs. Pretty disapointing... 
Anyways hope this helped!"
"The problem isn't dying, it's getting lost"
too scary; gave me nightmares
good atmostphere nice graphics but stale and repetative gameplay.
"Dont bother,the game will not even open.The doom console will have a error and will refuse to open the game"
Boring. Very boring. Just stupid shooter. Far from Doom III
"Where should I begin? 

This game lacks feeling..
Weapons have no feeling, they are quite literally click and shoot. Doesn't feel like shooting at all. 
Movement is the same way, you have no feel for it either. Can hardly even hear my own foot steps. Using Muffle and sneaking in Skyrim makes more noise for fucks sake.
You get hit, but that doesn't feel either. Your health and armor just diminishes. 
Eventually you'll die as some random imp, or even some ""Baron of Hell"", was tearing you apart, as you had simply no way of telling via sound, or any kind of feeling where from. Imagine having huge as Mancubus behind you, shooting at you, and only way you know it's there is by looking that way..
Lockdown here, lockdown there, and only way to deal with them is always the same ritual.. Go to pod (or what ever it was) to piss off demons, non-stop run and shoot demons till the game stops spawning them.. Kinda gets boring after few of those. 
The lockdown areas are so recognizable, symmetrical, and in a shape what reminds you of Unreal Tournament.

Wish it was still the case of ""You're stuck with demons in mars."""
"HDR does not work at all, the game disables it on launch therefore if you only have a hdr monitor like me you will have to play in black and white, can't say anything else because im not playing a game in black and white and btw no tech support people can figure it out either."
The game is over hyped and is pretty boring .
"Very disappointing. Coming from Doom 3 with its few but scary monsters, slow paced survival horror atmosphere, this game feels like Quake with bots, it's basically an arcade zombie shooter. You just run around bunny hopping and blasting tons of hell spawns. In half hour I lost all interest in what's going on in the game, you just get to checkpoints and kill monsters. I regret that I can't refund it because it was purchased by a 3rd party store. Hope Doom Eternal isn't done in the same manner
Edit: After forcing myself to finish the game, I still can't recommend it. Gets repetitive very quickly, I wished there were more puzzles or anything to challenge your mind, instead of endless monsters in which aspect I guess it does alright. But it's just mindless shooting. The secrets or challenges are often impossible, even after exploring every way, I still had to look up secrets on google. And this comes from a player that completed a lot of puzzle related games in the past.
The achievements are also locked behind grinding or multiplayer which is dead. Same as the game"
4 years later and some bugs still aren't fixed(like argent tower ending locking up)
"I feel a good description of why I don't recommend this is  ""Louder does not mean better.""

It's decent, with blights of action that seem awesome, It seems as it's still new it'll be a controversial take to say it really does not have the ""soul"" or ""spirit"" of the original DOOM'92. It'll be a nice action experience to turn your brain off and forget about and say you had fun in a couple parts. It's small attempt at a dynamic story seems very uncomplimentary as the tiny moments of action then followed by slugs or corridors and puzzles is just a grind fest for some meaningless dialogue for a less meaningful cliffhanger ending.

DOOM isn't back with explosions and roars like it seemed to be presented as when this released. I would personally suggest trying GZDOOM if you have been hooked on this game being the fast paced, high action shooter it unfortunately is not."
"Yes this game is amazing and everyone should have it. But I'm leaving a negative review for the time being to bring light to an inexcusable issue.

If you have a controller plugged in, (or if the game thinks you do, which frequently happens) the game doesn't 100% properly utilize keyboard functionality. In particular, you can't switch weapons using the Weapon Wheel, you can't choose which Runes you want to equip, the map controls aren't quite right, and all of the in-game HUD/UI will display controller inputs instead of keyboard inputs. This problem can be solved by forcing Steam to hide your controller, (right-click on the game in your library and choose Properties and change Steam Input Per Game to Force Off.) but for people who actually do want use a controller sometimes, this means you need to restart the game everytime you want to switch between controller and keyboard. This is inexcusable and there's no reason any PC game made in the last 15 years should have this problem, let alone one with such a high budget."
since steam upgrade the game will not load
would be nice if the loading screens weren't 10 years long

It is below average compared to the other doom games.
"It's okay, but definitely hard sometimes in a ""restart the whole level because I'm not healthy enough to fight the boss now"" or ""restart because I need to grind and upgrade some weapons first"" way.  The Rune trials are also often (not always) extremely tedious--do your best job and keep trying until luck breaks your way.  

Your know how some really hard challenges are fun and others are just kind of grinding work?  This feels like the latter to me.  More stressed after playing than before, and a feeling of wasting time sometimes more than having fun.

A lot of nostalgia value though."
"Its fun, but its plagued with technical issues, the game cant start propertly, alt tab is an instant crash. Its been 4 years, doubt they are planning to fix it. I suggest you to get the console version if you own one and want to play this game. Its a mess on PC."
gud but borin im play this game bored (((
Impossible to beat the game due to corrupt save issues.
The controls for the game are very bad and the story is not interesting so i can never sit down and play for more than a hour before not playing for about a month
"I've played it less than hour. I purchased it from a sale for like 4.5 euros. And perhaps it's not a bad game, but it's just not for me. I was hoping that with all the hype this game has had since it's launch, I'd dig it, but I guess shooters simply aren't for me. So in case you aren't that much into shooters but think you may enjoy this, be aware."
"It starts out ok,  it is fun for a while but then the fact that they make you dance like a trained monkey around and demands that you play the game in a certain way makes it tedious and it looses the charm fast. By the end you only carry on because you put the time in it and want to get it over with."
I put 6 hours in it and got corrupted save file.
"Highly fed up with this one.
Annouced as a glorious comeback, it is only a mere shadow of former DOOM. Ok, it is dynamic, but still ONLY a arena-type shooter - get into the arena, kill certain amount of demons, push a switch, move to another arena. After a few almost exactly same level it's only boring. Advertised ""gory kills"" are fun, at least for a first few times - than again, boring and a waste of time. The only break from arenas is searching for secrets, which require some jumping, most usually. But - during a high-pace arena fights those are easy to miss, and than... the game doesn't allow you to backtrack to them ! So basically forget about 100% complete game in one run. Or restart levels a dozen times, when yo realise you missed something.
Oh, and on top of that - this game has almost NO STORY whasoever - you only run forward and shoot. Hey, it may have worked in the early 90s, but - suprise suprise ! - that was more than twenty years ago ! 
I may be in a sort of minority, but I strongly believe that previous DOOM game - DOOM 3 - was the propper way for the series... this one is only a vintage crap packed in modern, shiny box...

NOT RECOMMENDED at all !!!"
This game is scam. I bought it year ago and then it did not work properly. fuck doom developers
Самый переоцененный шутер десятилетия.
i am dumb and get lost in linear game
"So you've likely heard everyone gushing with praise for this game by now. Well then allow me to be one of the few voices of dissent here. That isn't to say I don't recognize the game's strengths, but I feel it's important that people know some of its weaknesses - and for me personally those weaknesses were infuriating. For context, I played on Ultra-Violence.

[u][b]Pros:-[/b][/u]

1) The Combat: This is what you're here for, and the game definitely wins on this front. The enemies are challenging and varied. I'll just say that the game definitely gives you the old school Doom feel, but now complemented with modern tools for your own character.

2) The Performance: Id has always been known for top notch engine optimization, and they deliver again here. I also haven't come across any bug so far, so their reputation for polish is well deserved.

3) The Soundtrack: This is actually a departure from how previous Doom games sounded, but it suits the new feel. It's subdued when traversing the areas, but then dials up during pitched encounters.

4) Classic Maps: Each level of the game also has a hidden secret classic Doom map unlock, rendered in the same old school graphics. Once unlocked, you can play through them at your leisure. Nice touch!

5) Snapmap: Pretty nifty custom level designer.

[u][b]Cons:-[/b][/u] So what could possibly be wrong if the game runs smooth and combat feels great? Well, this will come down to personal preference for many of you, but for me the following things frustrated me a lot. They're not failures though, but rather deliberate design decisions - ones I tend to strongly dislike.

1) The Save System: I absolutely abhor it when devs take away player control, and that's what they've chosen to do in this game. The game uses a checkpoint system, that keeps updating as you clear out areas - your game will only ever have one save i.e. your last checkpoint. I'm perfectly fine with this actually. What I'm not fine with is how we have no control over when those checkpoints occur, nor even any indication of where in the levels they are. The notifications just pop up every so often in the corner of your screen. I'm not asking for the ability to save wherever we want (such as in the middle of a firefight), but an interactable object that we can choose to activate would've been a much better choice. You can make it such that it can only be activated after clearing whatever gauntlets are meant to be handled in that area, which would serve to still prevent save-scumming. Why is this an issue? Cos there's frequently stuff you want to do before moving on after each set piece, and having the checkpoint trigger automatically means you have to do all of that again every time you have to reload. And then there's times when you've done something challenging (but that's not fun), following which you then desperately hope for another checkpoint somewhere just so you don't have to do it again. Like what, you ask? Well...

2) The Platforming: Was Doom ever known as a platformer? Well apparently now it is one. I don't know what made the devs think the FPS crowd was hungry for platform challenges, but here we are. It's not even a particularly good platformer (there are far better titles for that - try Ghostrunner for instance). It's just there, shoehorned into a franchise that never needed it. Thankfully it's not constant, but it is liberally present. The platforming sections are a pain to get through, and what's worse is that many of them don't feature a checkpoint at the end (like all the major combat set pieces do). So if you do die soon after, you'll be forced to go through the whole chore again.

3) The Level Design: This is something that does carry over from the classic Doom games - some levels being confusing mazes, requiring liberal consultation of the map (which is thankfully better than in the classic games). This is, mind you, a linear game, not open world. But while the set piece combat encounters can be intense, there can also be significant downtime between them while you get your bearings. Also, some levels have also borrowed a page from Doom 3 - permanently locking off earlier parts of the level. I'm not talking about locking the door for a fight mind, but just preventing you from going back for good. Not for any sensible narrative reason either, just shutting it off with a door no longer responding or a ledge you have to drop from being too high to jump back up to. I hated that aspect of Doom 3, and I hate it here too (though thankfully it's less common here than in 3). Yes yes, I know this game is all about push forward action, but let that be left to players' discretion, yeah? Btw, for some reason health packs - that you've already picked up! - respawn when you reload a checkpoint, though armor and ammo doesn't. Not sure why, but I don't like it. This is on Ultra-Violence.

4) The Difficulty Curve: The game is indeed tough on the higher difficulties. However, here we have yet another game that falls into the trap of seemingly getting easier as you get further into it. Between weapon mods, suit upgrades and rune unlocks, the new enemies you face simply can't keep up. It's not about the difficulty levels either - raising that will still have its biggest impact early in the game, tapering off later. I suppose this isn't as much of a problem if you're the type to set yourself personal challenges (hardcore, speedruns, 1 gun runs, etc.), but for the regular player it feels kinda off.

[u][b]Overall:-[/b][/u] Well there you have it. Is it a good game? Yes, but it also requires you to put up with certain infuriating decisions. If you're the type who's okay with all of that, then great. The game will work for you. For me, it was an experience composed of awesome intense set piece battles, followed by oft-infuriating stuff outside of that. There's also an Arcade mode available, so maybe the game is just best played that way. Anyway, I hope all this exposition helped someone."
Not as good as the original game.
"No quick save, too much button mashing mastery required for double jumps, and all of the cheat codes have been disabled except for God mode. It went from a PC classic to another console disappointment."
too scary.
no jungle. pretty bad
"Imagine going through the game and missing one hidden trial because the game unnecessarily blocks you from backtracking in levels by sealing doors on you, so you go have to go back to mission select and restart to complete it and it bugs your game and you lose all your upgrade points and have to keep redoing the same level because it never registers the challenges you finished as completed. Wouldn't that be crazy?"
"Took too much brain capacity to play, BARREL RADIUS IS TOO BIG NERF BARRELS I HATE YOU BETHESDA >:(((((("
my save was corrupted after power outage and I`m not feeling like starting over
Graphics + Music is great but find the gameplay to be a bit bland and boring. Didn't live up to the hype
It's just not that fun. Insanely repetitive and insipid gameplay.
"What a dumb, dumb game.

If tearing demons' limbs with a shotgun blast and then bashing their skulls in an explosion of blood, before cutting a zombie demon in half with a chainsaw sounds appealing to you, I guess the game is addressed to you. It so happened that a game being a gorefest hasn't been a selling point to me since I turned 14.

What speaks volumes is that while I looked online for a solution to an issue I had with the game showing only gamepad prompts and no keyboard/mouse ones, I actually saw people advising others to play the game with a controller instead of the standard FPS mouse + keyboard combo. After only some minutes in the game, you can understand why: it's an FPS where aiming is mostly irrelevant. You are encouraged to charge in with your shotgun and get up close and personal, as made obvious by the glory kill system (a melee finisher on staggered enemies).

Environments sometimes seem to be clear, until all of a sudden waves of demons appear out of nowhere, making the game a glorified version of Left 4 Dead, but with even less subtlety (not that L4D had much of it).

The best thing I can say about Doom is that if I may have harbored an interest for Doom Eternal and might have been tempted to buy it during a sale, at least now I know to stay clear of it thanks to this one."
I cant keep up with this... its just shooting running around press f...press g when out of ammo. I have no room to be creative or developing any better playstyle.. i like the music tho.
"cool, tho basic tier single player FPS's are totally lost on me. plus DOOM ETERNAL exists so this game is kinda pointless."
This game is awful. It's incredibly racist and xenophobic in the way only sweaty white gamergate gamers could enjoy. Please avoid this alt-right drivel
less fun than filing your taxes

"Just all in all an atrocious game that I would never recommend to anyone, after playing the game I have realised that since doom 3, the franchise has spiraled down hill and I will never buy a single game of this franchise. The movement is clunky and slow. Weapons uninspiring and sort of garbage. They make the main character into some super soldier that is supposed to end hell. However whilst playing the game I felt more like a pincushion for the enemies and often times died because I came around a corner and the AI, seeing me through the wall, calculated where I would end up. This would be fine for a game like doom 3 because it was old and the tech and possibilities were not developed or advanced enough at the time. But at 2016 this is not ok. Oh and btw this is definitely not a horror game it is an action shooter and nothing more."
Meh
i dont have doom
Meh
Console-esque eye candy junk with none of the original flavour of the game.
insanely repetitive but still the best doom game
Bad game
Doom Eternal has no Deathmatch or team Deathmatch. Dont even bother paying these bethesda fucks any money until they realize they fucked up. Fucking morons.
Evil vodoo demonic witchcraft stuff. Me no gusta.
Movement is pretty bad. They brought back that gliding around map feel to it. Huge difference in the original versus this... old game is was like one shot kill and this you have to spend a little effort with the kills making the movement horrible.
"I've beat this game twice, once on console and once on PC and I still don't get the hype of this game. I want to like it I do but I just cant I get SO bored after like half an hour it just feels repetitive almost all the time. I want to, but I cant say I enjoyed this game."
dogshit ähxde
Loved the game; my save got corrupted.
"Was kinda meh for me, a good game but fuck glory kills. Also once you get past level 4 or some shit level design devolves into arena -> corridor. I did like it somewhat but it wasn't worth the price. Game was way overhyped imo."
"Sorry, while I like the game I can;t get behind any game that does not allow you to save when exiting. I have other things in my life going on that to try and figure out when is a good time to end playing a game because I may have to redo too much is just stupid. Sorry those that want the challenge of no save should have an option to select that. Too bad as I like the game, but a royal pain without any save option"
No sound. No help. No refund.
"I went into this game with big expectations. It started strong, but quickly went down. I was forcing myself to just finish it, but I couldn't. Not because it was hard, but because I was extremely bored and unmotivated.

Cons:
- Extremely repetitive
- Linear
- Predictable
- Bad story

Pros:
- Gorgeous graphics (even in 2020)

Level recap: 20% demon shooting in designated area, 80% platforming for keys/collectibles. 
Melee system is really silly - you need 12 rockets to make demon just kneel, but you can punch through his chest and rip it's heart off. Why bother shooting? Just kung-fu through...

Upgrade system for weapons is good idea, but it is very simple. A little more depth to it would make the game better.

Voice acting is terrible. I mean a tiny bit above windows narrator level.

If you like straight jump'n'shoot with nothing else, then this is for you. If you like games with good story, depth and rich gameplay - I do not recommend this game to you."
dont like
My eyes are failing me and making me dizzy
"Doom eternals better. Only play this to get the story, then just go to doom eternal"
"The game has very bad checkpoint system, feels like I'm playing a game straight from 1990's where autosave functionality was not invented."
"I don't really think this game is for me at the end of the day but I still think the concept is cool.

I recommend you try it out and see for yourself!"
"DOOM 2016 is frustrating, not because it is difficult or because it is a bad game, but because its overall design often loses track of what the game is very clearly trying to be.

Let's get this out of the way; the soundtrack is fantastic and the core gameplay of shooting demons is really fun and mostly well-built, yadda yadda yadda. Everyone's been telling you this because it's true, the game is a lot of fun when it's focusing on this. The issue is the game doesn't seem to want to focus on its strengths due to some misguided nostalgia-baiting mixed with some strangely shoehorned-in mechanics from more modern design trends. This review will not focus on the good, because every other one does and because ultimately? The game doesn't want to focus on it either, so why should this review do so?

DOOM 2016's pacing is terrible, and doesn't get into a nice rhythm until the last 3 levels of the game (which is a real shame, because those last three levels are really good). In an effort to channel DOOM 1 and 2's former glory, the game aims for a 50/50 split between combat and exploration, with big labyrinthine maps. While this worked very well in previous games because the games were built for it, with slower-paced combat, interesting and varied environments and, let's face it, technical limitations which made scouring the map for keys one of the only ways to extend playtime and offering variety, DOOM 2016's exploration is completely at odds with its combat system. Combat is lightning fast and adrenaline-pumping, while exploration is, frankly, a boring slog with horrendous platforming sections in them. This could be fine if the environments were actually interesting, which they are not, with the same color palette across all levels but the last three and generally uninspired visual presentation. It could have been fun if the movement had been designed to make traversing the environment fun, like with grappling hooks (I really hope Eternal fixes this, I haven't played it yet as of writing this) or really anything to make exploration anything else from just walking a barren landscape, and while DOOM 2016's movement works really well for combat, it definitely isn't enjoyable on its own. Finally, exploration could have been interesting if the map design was geared for it and provided interesting paths, but it feels like the maps were designed more as big labyrinths with some rewards sprinkled here and there rather than an actual level with a consideration for the way the player would traverse it. 
This utterly killed the game for me. The early stages have those huge maps with boring exploration, and the combat sequences which are really good are very short, which makes going back to the exploration even more painful. It feels like the game reluctantly goes ""ugh, fine, here are some enemies to fight. But don't take too long, you have more uninteresting terrain to sift through!!"", merely accessing your demand for fun rather than offering it. 

And, as if to further drag the fun down, to exploration is associated a... progression system. Completely superfluous and ultimately more damaging than anything, DOOM 2016 has your character receive incremental gains to your health, armor and ammo pick-ups as well as some other features throughout the game. These upgrades do not change gameplay, as all they do is ""make x attack more powerful, give x more damage"", and in some cases actually make gameplay worse; one upgrade option is to receive more ammo from pickups. Should you upgrade this, running out of ammo is no longer a concern, so you won't be switching weapons as much (maybe this changes in higher difficulties, I played through the game on Ultra-Violence, but really if you need a system to balance out 2 difficulty modes out of 5 but harms the other 3... maybe you should rethink some things). This doesn't exactly force you down exploration, I was able to go on perfectly fine by avoiding the parts which I found unenjoyable, but it certainly kills pacing when you have to regularly go in a menu to pick an option to make your armor cap go up. 
Some upgrades, called Runes, actually do impact gameplay a little bit and are somewhat interesting, especially since they are acquired through challenge missions you have to do. However, those are hidden throughout the map. That same boring map. They aren't too hard to find, but again, the player needs to slog through exploration to get to the good part.
Similarly, the weapon attachments, essentially secondary fire, are very interesting and are most of the time situated on the main path. However, each weapon has two options of secondary fire, which as a result makes some of them very superfluous. Why have one of your attachments make you immobile, in a game where being immobile is the best way to get you killed? They could have been great as a super-situational thing to do, but you need to actively switch your secondary module in battle, which takes wayyyy too much time even with the upgrade that makes it faster, which means switching weapon then module ultimately isn't worth the risk taken by not shooting for so long.

Both of these things take away a lot from the actual fun of the combat. The last three levels demonstrate how great this game can be, as those issues are stripped away; no more exploration, by that time you have unlocked mostly everything and have settled in a set of modules which you never change, and combat encounters last much longer. But, and this is a theme throughout the game, to get there you need to slog through unnecessary, boring bullshit where encounters are very short and you need to explore the boring map and complete annoying platforming puzzles to progress. 

While the fun parts are fun, DOOM 2016 is frustratingly unfocused, and I ultimately cannot recommend it, especially with Eternal out there and, hopefully, stripped away of these issues. I might give Eternal a try and update this review later on, but until then... 
Oh, and the audio is pretty unstable in 2020. Dialogue sometimes lowers to an inaudible volume and some SFX are repeated and layered to a very loud volume. I also had a couple glitches here and there. Aaaand the loading times are atrociously long."
"it's almost good but i cant overlook that this racist game is deeply rooted in colonialism and other problematic things like that, it's like duke nukem but for the alt-right and bad guys"
"Headache of a map system and trivially easy gameplay. You just move forward, kill things, check the map. That's all. Doesn't stand up vs a game like borderlands, where the gameplay feels very directed and objectives aren't a headache to track. I get that it's doom, but games are and were capable of more when this was released. Flashy and gory, but sort of a shallow experience I do not wish to continue. The best part was the music."
"Complex and secret filled levels, hell demons, massive guns, phenomenal music. A true PC FPS masterpiece. Why would you play some other lame, console port with unskippable cutscenes, checkpoint saves, despawning corpses, awkward first person platforming and canned kill animations? Except DOOM 2016 has all of these modern blights and somehow still gets a pass. IMO, the positives I mentioned (which really are very positive) make these issues feel even worse. The checkpoint system makes exploring the levels, with their atrocious map system, an absolute chore. Miss a jump, get stuck in the geometry, or die in combat? You might get sent back to the beginning of a combat encounter from 10 minutes ago and have to do all of it again. Some of the secrets are difficult to pick out from normal level geometry and being unable to quicksave really dissuades you from wanting to 'experiment' with a potential tricky jump.

Speaking of platforming: it's not particularly hard, but you're always at the mercy of the automatic ledge grabbing. Sometimes (albeit rarely) it eats a jump input or won't register a ledge. If this causes you to have to restart from a checkpoint that was 2 combat encounters ago, you might be more than a little annoyed. Anything not tagged as a ledge will just cause you to slide off or will glitch you out of the map (this game has very fragile geometry, check out a speed run), so platforming is a matter of finding the pre-set paths, rather than figuring out your own route. 

Every time I'm forced to sit through another stupid cutscene, I wish I had a keybind to punch the screen and ignore what was happening, like in the first level. (Great joke the first time you see it, but makes you wish they'd just stuck with talking heads for the story). There's generally 1-2 at the beginning and/or end of every single level and none of them are in any way necessary. 

Those are the major negatives, really. The despawning corpses (even on a powerful PC at nightmare settings) is just kind of a lame concession to performance when the game already runs incredibly well on modest hardware. With all the backtracking required, it would be cool to see the carnage from prior fights. The fights themselves are more repetitive and random than the original Doom and the pacing is either 0 during exploration or dialed up to 11 for every combat encounter. A lot of people seem to like it, I've just kinda gotten tired of it around halfway through. Yeah, it looks and sounds excellent, especially with the epic soundtrack, but the combat is simplistic and not particularly challenging even on Nightmare difficulty if you're an experienced FPS player. Enemies are weaker to certain weapons and alt fire modes, but you can make it through any combat encounter without paying attention to that at all if you just aim your shots. There are a decent number of other FPS games out there with a higher skill ceiling and equally satisfying combat if you're into that sort of thing. 

Look, I don't expect most people to find much value in this review. Most people have already played this game and are totally thrilled with it, and that's great. However, if you somehow haven't tried it yet and any of the issues I've mentioned seem particularly tedious and frustrating, maybe just play something else."
This game feels like it's turned down to 9.
scary
"The game is boring and repetitive. I don't understand why the rating is so high to such not interesting game. No plot at all. Maybe for first Doom in 1993 it was okay because game dev. was limited , but for now days it's not playable at all."
"people are afraid to call this game bad because it's a doom game by id software and takes the rip and tear doomguy meme in stride. the game makes a really good first impression but that falls really quick and you immediately see that it leans on crutches to make up for issues with the game's core gameplay loop and general pacing. the game holds a carrot over your head and jiggles it constantly in a desperate bid to facilitate player engagement. the doomguy getting frustrated at the lack of shooty shooty in cutscenes as the game slowly and methodically trods you through a bunch of empty cooridors with boring exposition setpieces and fallout-tier voiceovers does not make me go ""haha this is sooo ironic"" it makes me go ""you could have cut all of this out, cut out this entire level, and the game would have been better off""

the game isn't about shooting things, its about using a call of duty quick melee attack. its about collecting items to unlock suit and weapon upgrades to help you collect more items. everything you want from this game is an illusory experience presented to you through overcomplicated proxy systems. the challenge of the hardest difficulty is in where the game decides to teleport you after the quick melee kills - you can literally see the imps in the background waiting for your animation to finish before winding up another fireball. the core gameplay loop is disorienting, it doesn't give you a challenge, it just makes you feel like you're rolling dice and overwhelms you with meta-choices to give you the illusion of depth. there are obvious dopamine pellet dispensers built into every facet of this game's design and im surprised the demons don't make slot machine noises and spit glowing gold coins out of their mouths when they die. oh wait

i didn't play this game for very long and i never want to play it ever again. this isn't mild displeasure, its straight up disgust"
boring as hell
"Doomguy runs slow as hell now, every difficulty up to ultraviolence is pissbaby easy. Nightmare is only ""hard"" because you're incredibly slow and fat, so there are some fast projectiles you can't dodge without a lot of space to get momentum going, and the damage on almost everything is cranked up to be a 2 hit kill from full health. Imps just spend most of their time running around like chickens with their heads cut off, and every enemy has such a comically long wind up animation you'd have to be sedated to actually be surprised by their attack if they're anywhere in your field of view. This is mostly just boring tech demo shit, most of the player's time is spent waiting for glory kill animations, being visually assaulted by gigantic tutorial popups and unskippable weapon pickup animations that block off even more of the screen not already occupied by the giant hud* and giant viewmodels. I could have gone through the first quarter of DooM 2 just in the time spent stuck waiting for cutscenes about the story I couldn't give half of a rat's ass about. 

If you actually want this sort of garbage you're far better off just playing brutal doom, at least that's garbage that doesn't make you wait for the mediocre combat, or try to shove some garbage syfy channel b-movie ""story"" down your throat every 2 seconds.

*It is possible to disable the more offensively huge elements of the hud, however you're still stuck with every weapon viewmodel taking up about a third of the screen at all times."
"Difficulty played: Ultra-Violence.
Status: Abandoned (got approximately to the point where I get the BFG).

Not very DOOM. Awkward movement system that works, but is flawed in design due to its indecision with whether it wants to be fluid or tanky. Incredibly uninspired level design. Story that is lackluster and is not daring enough in regards to exploring the topics it sets to explore. As that one rare fan of original DOOM with a dislike for this game, I feel unimpressed by this game and personally struggle to recommend it to anyone.

If you really like boomer shooters, Dusk, Wrath, Amid Evil are better at being boomer shooters for sure. And I definitely did play better gory and snappy games than this, but don't think that I can give directions in that regard."
"Every time I open the game, it usually gets to the title and then freezes my entire PC. The only way to stop it is by restarting my PC. It's literally unplayable."
full of bugs defenatly not recomended although the story is good i couldn't finish it
The game suddenly has got too big for my hard drive with all the updates FFS
any reason for the game always crash?
I hate checkpoints.
i know what it feels like to be a child again.... (i had a very poor upbringing and it brings me lots of negative thoughts)
"This game was probably great when it came out, it has fun gameplay, a decent storyline, but now it seems to only want to run like garbage. Constantly throughout playing the game, it would tell me I ran out of space, but the amount I needed was ""0kg"", and it would tell me that exact thing every 5 minutes. Then if I died, the game would jump to the main menu when I wanted to restart from a checkpoint, and then finally, when I dealt with all that to get to the final boss, I died, the game threw me back to the main menu, and my save file got corrupted. I just wanted to play this so I could then play doom eternal, but this game doesn't want me to play it."
"Better than its sequel ""DOOM Eternal"" but still has many flaws and outdated game design such as colored key cards. The demons in this game look way more menacing and scarier than the ones in Doom Eternal's which look so dumb and cartoon like! The single player campaign is amazing with so many weapons and demon enemy types to eviscerate! The multiplayer is underrated and not as bad as reviewers and people say it is. This game is pretty damn good though with excellent sound design, graphics, level design, and gun play! Although I wish the guns sounded louder and the gore and blood was increased. The plasma pistol sucks balls though and at least in the sequel you start off with a shotgun! Doom 3 was a more unique shooter! Still this game is amazingly fun and looks amazing and it's way more polished than Brutal Doom which has lost it's novelty and feels like a 12 year old edgy wet dream! This game does feel more and generic in my honest opinion."
"My biggest gripe with the new DOOM:

Finishing moves. Is this Mortal Kombat? No, that doesn't belong here. And... how come when I do these moves I lose more health than I gain? What is the point of this?

They did this in the newer Doom too. So it's dead to me. I don't understand this mechanic. Is this what kids want these days?

Also after giving it another go, I realized you can get carried away killing enemies and then miss some secret and can't go back to the previous room. Getting all the secrets requires some very methodical approach which is odd for a shooter.

Weapon upgrades aren't bad but they're not that great."
"Spent months playing this (with a cheat code) and have NEVER played ANY multiplayer game.  Would spend hours just wandering around looking for hidden spots and shortcuts using a cheat to make it easier to wander around.  BUT NO MORE, use of ANY cheat makes the save game corrupt, totally uncalled for and puts a nail in the coffin, this franchise is dead, now to get my money back as they have bricked the game to me and it not how i purchased it, bait and switch. They might have done it thinking I would go buy the new one (almost did) but, nope, not gonna ever happen."
very repetitive and boring. I truly struggled and forced myself to finish this game. no interesting story or narrative to save it either.
"i played this a game a while ago and it was pretty fun. i recently had an urge to replay it and found something really disturbing. if you look carefully, there is a lot of satanic imagery that i didnt even know was there! please do not let your kids play this game,  it is tainted by the devil! god bless, and my prayers are with you."
"Mick deserved none of this; boycott Bethesda, id Software, ZeniMax, and Microsoft.
https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce"
"Don't buy this crap. This game is shit. I killed everything! It was amazing! Lots of fun. But I can't progress until I find that red keycard. So I pull up the map. Oh, sweet lord... Let's obscure EVERYTHING by piling layers upon layers of floors on top of each other. The map looks great; it would rock as 3D screensaver, BUT IT'S SHIT AS  A FUNCTIONING MAP!!! These levels are HUGE! They're vertically layered. It's a great amount of fun, but when you've killed everything and you're wandering these empty mazes trying to find a keycard you missed it becomes soooooo boring and soooooo frustrating."
I miss classic doom music
"Level design could be better, tons of ""where do i go"" nonsense. Honestly at this point just get Doom eternal. The weapon handling feels so much better in Doom Eternal than here."
"The first two thirds of the game were pretty dull. One minute you were slaying demons having an alright but somewhat repetitive time, then you were systematically searching every inch of the level for a keycard that you missed somewhere for what feels like an eternity, that happened a few times. Where am I meant to go? Where is it? Then eventually you find it tucked away on a corpse in some obscure corner that you didn't notice because of the sheer number of corpses you see on your travels.
The game did get a fair bit better towards the end, but still not great. It also crashed a few times near the end."
"While Doom 2016 is a very good recreation of the original Doom game it feels lacking in mechanical depth and map variety to match up with other games in the same genre. Overall the has a solid gameplay loop, but it is missing some moment options to really get into an endless flow for me. Doom eternal has moment mechanics and level design variety that feels like it should have been in Doom 2016.

 If you have not played any of the new doom games I recommend getting just Doom Eternal as it feels more like what the original vision for Doom 2016 should have been."
i played  for around 9 hours of the game then the graphics took a shit and died on me plz fix
"The map drives me crazy.  Finding the way forward is a mystery  No guide points.  It's a jumping puzzle,???"
i don't know how they took the concept of killing demons in hell and made it just kinda boring and repetitive but they sure did
"If Steam had a neutral option, it would be for this Game. Given the generous Checkpoint system, the times that I've clipped though floors, walls, ""simply jumped out of bounds into a trapped area"", and been yeeted off the map from hitting a surface the wrong way, I'll look past it.

I heard a lot about the game's music and mechanics, but playing it didn't live up to the hype. Glory kills and the chainsaw sound like an interesting mechanic, but it doesn't feel satisfying. It's like Bethesda just giving us a pat on the back and saying, ""Oh You're SO COOL THE DOOM SLAYER, And SOOOO Sassy with you're angsty attitude. Press button for GLORY KILL....and another.....and another.........."" 

The weapon choice seemed a bit bleak, though the mods were somewhat interesting. I don't know if I was expecting something like the old school quake/doom high octane arenas, but it felt more like a prius running on regular. I've have felt more high-octance from a BL2 fight than here.

Anyone else notice the Hell Razer enemy looks so weird, like you can notice the live action animation capture in the way it fumbles around?

Sure I was distracted half the time trying to find random secrets which slowed the game, but since it's tied to the full upgrading experience, don't you have to?"
"The combat is very good, but the maps are abismal, hate them with with the fires of hell!"
"The movement is too slow, the weapon handling and upgrades are kinda lame, the story is dull. Arena fights are fun from time to time but pretty repetitive. So the campaign is lame. The arcade mode on the other hand is quite fun.

Pros
[list]
[*] Graphics are decent
[*] Arena mode is fun
[*] It's Doom
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] optimization has a potential for improvements. It took me quite a while to find settings that look decent and maintain 80-90 fps at 1440p. Those fps are extremely low considering the graphics quality and the size of each section.
[*] Movement speed is kinda slow
[*] Some of the weapons or too situational and just seem to be useless even when upgraded till the max. I ended up using only three guns and switched to the fourth when I didn't have anything else left or when I didn't wanna use the chainsaw yet to refill my ammo.
[*] Multiple guns share the same type of ammo so you are never going to touch half of your guns. I'd prefer a different type of ammo for each gun so I'd be forced to use them even though some of them just need a buff.
[*] I don't like the mechanic of the chainsaw refilling so much of your ammo. Its just going from ""I don't have any ammo at all"" to ""Wow, I can't pick up any further ammo""
[*] I didn't play it on a high difficulty level since some of the deaths in the beginning were simply frustrating. The overall combat doesn't seem to be balanced at all. It changes from 10 minutes with a low amount of enemies and boring fights to a lot of enemies within the blink of an eye. Sometimes this leads to intense fights but I'd prefer these intense fights all the time with better guns since the TTK against heavy enemies is pretty long.
[/list]

This game has potential and with just a few minor tweaks could be insanely good and a hell of a banger:
[list]
[*] faster movemend speed
[*] more enemies
[*] less downtime
[*] better weapons and/or shorter ttk
[*] rebalancing of weapons
[*] different ammo types for each gun
[/list]

When you completed a game it's never a good sign when you are glad it is finally over."
"canny boring and repetitive once you get past the first hour the game is just boring, no real story no purpose just shoot or bash ""F"" 
i do get the appeal its just not for me"
unironically bored me to death on Ultra Nightmare
Cringe
"hjuujgmklh









































no"
"For 6 bucks the game is worth it for sure I'd say. 
As usual however Id Software show how aside from gunplay they are entirely incompetent at everything else but yet this time there are incompetent at the gunplay in this by forcing you to gunplay less. Watching this I never could realize how the disturbingly stup*d as f*ck melee totally ruins the game to such a amazing degree. Makes playing this without ever using melee no matter what under any circumstances impossible so you have to bring fists to, every, GUNfight. Harder difficulty past normal is not doable or more like utterly completely needlessly totally impossible since you won't have the ammo and health.
Soundtrack is pretty much for fact worst soundtrack of the decade and even saying the word soundtrack is being generous. It's literally just annoying noise. 

All negatives aside at least this game is still better then playing a sick fucked in the head terrorist

This game is now my new low bar for trash gunplay the previous holder being Shadow Warrior 2 where at least the pea shooters and airsoft guns gave you enough ammo to kill enemies and killed way waaaay damn faster. Game does Doom such a disservice it's mind boggling why the studio hates Doom so much... but easy to figure out why just need to look at the stupid masses"
"Not a game for me I guess...

I couldn't follow the Map and spent most of time wandering around lost. In the end I uninstalled where I had to climb some tower and kill some lady and basically I got fed up trying to find my way around and the endless mind numbing Demon fights became a boring slog fest. 
Graphics are good and its a visually stunning Game. If you like killing Hordes of Demons then this is for you. 

I'll stick to killing NAZI's :)"
"I really wanted this game to be fun. I gave it several chances. But I really don't want to have to use a walkthrough for every level. The action is awesome and I want more of that, but every level is turning into an experience where I have to explore every nook and cranny to figure out the next step or find the next keycard. Sure there are waypoints, but they lead behind locked doors. Sure there is a minimap but I explore every available greyed out area with no luck. It's just not fun."
fro
It's just running around shooting things. The space is like a maze so you can be looking for a way to move forward for quite some time just to go further. I was expecting more because of the reviews but it is actually quite basic.
"this might anger some people, but honestly, just play Eternal. It's better in literally every conceivable way. This game is fun at first but REALLY starts to drag on in the later missions. It's a slower, more tedious, less varied version of Doom Eternal. You can just skip it really.

Amazing soundtrack though"
"Not what i expected, gameplay made me dizzy. Maybe allow a demo of it first, if there is one, and i missed it. im sorry."
"It was fun while it lasted, but had to jump through loops just to get the game to save, had to figure out how to create a new save location in the game files.....when that was over, progressed through the campaign, game crashed, save corrupted....i just didn't feel like messing around with it anymore, so i uninstalled until i feel like restarting the game."
shit game
"Fun but quickly repetitive and mind numbing, game for a 12 year old who just wants to shoot stuff with no challenge."
"played it on family share, have no idea how I'm allowed to review it, lets give it a thumbs down so people wonder what my problem was with the game but all I want to know is how I can review the game that I've never had, steam is wacky"
kids did not enjoy
"Couldn't get into DOOM, bought it because the hype and reviews but was disappointed by the game play."
"Very pretty and technically superbly optimized but it's just not DOOM. You move from one arena combat to another one. Getting locked up  in a closed space with the monsters who spawn out of the thin air all around You is just a very boring approach to making the game more challenging. The scarcity of ammo and the generally ineffective weapons just add to the undoomlike feel of this game. No one-shot kills here. When You shoot a thing in the head with a shotgun You expect it to die, be it from Mars or Venus. that's the difference in using a shotgun over a pistol, right?"
Not my type of game fun first 30min after that everything is the same since its just mindless killing.
"Do I recommend it? Unfortunately not. 
Don't get me wrong it's a technological marvel, as ID soft games nearly always are and i've been playing them since my early teens when the original Doom took the world by storm.

But this? It seems to be confused about its identity. 

On the one hand it's being one of the most heart racing, awe inspiring gore drenched FPS in existence. And for this I love it.But on the other hand it's trying to be some kind of (action) RPG with bucket loads of text to read and upgrades to get. And to me the two just don't go very well hand in hand. If I wanted an action RPG i'd play Fallout.

The fact I have to keep stopping the demon slaughter to go read long rambling articles of text to fully be in tune with the story just totally kills it. Yes I could just skip all that but then I get that nagging feeling i'm missing out. I wish they could have narrated and acted the story and information better in game. 

Also what's extremely frustrating is that individual logs / articles are broken into multiple parts. Who thought that was a good idea?! It's just collections for collecting  sake. 

Doom 3 (my favorite of the series) did this far better in my opinion with audio logs you could listen to and play at the same time together with well dispersed cutscenes that didn't feel like they were taking away the action for too long. 
Shame: 4/10"
"Being an original Doom fan from back in the day, still are to some extent, this just doesn't cut it for me. Maybe, if you are 12 years old, this would be real fun. Stunning visuals, great map design, don't get me wrong. Sadly I just got bored with it and uninstalled when I reached the Hell chapters. 

SnapMap is terrible. I mean, really bad. A four-digit combination lock has way more possibilities than what you can rustle up with this. All content will look and feel the same, because it relies on pre-existing set pieces that can only be connected in certain ways, with no room for deviation. It's a shame developers have turned their backs on modding communities by introducing in-game pseudo-level editors that limit creativity - a Steam Workshop page would have been a game-changer.

And now there's this new Doom Eternal out... which is set in Hell.... and can also stay in hell, till hell freezes over, because I shall not be buying it anytime soon."
"What kind of bs is this? I no longer own the game?? My library just has the ""Purchase"" option and when i try to click ""Play now"" on the store page, it just redirects me to the same store page...."
As of today Augest 4th this game just stopped letting me play was about to hop on when it said i had to buy it again WTF Id and Bethesda FIX IT SO I CAN RIP AND TEAR
A game that no longer works asks me to buy it again why .
"我头回遇到这种傻逼事情，我玩了7个小时，睡前保存退出，第二天运行游戏变成了一个大大的“购买”！！卸载后库里也没有了。我CNMD我买了个试玩版吗？发行商还带回收功能的？谁能给我个解释？！
what the fuck! I have played the game over than 7 hours then can not to run the game, the ""run game"" button changed to ""buy the game"" what is the fucking problem?!"
"its a great game when it works, it keeps corrupting my save, boots me back to the title screen every time a checkpoint has to be loaded, it just freezes at random and I have to shut off my pc to close the game again. idk if im the only one with these kinds of issues."
"what a fucking joke! i download this piece of shit for 8 hours, install it, play 3 minutes, quit. come back 5 hours later and now the game won't launch.  and fucking steam won't even support it and refers me to the Bethesda website.  what kinda bullshit is this????"
dosnt work anymore dont buy
"Do I recommend this game? Yes. 
Do I recommend you buy this game? Yes.
Why do I not recommend this game in my review? DRM, see the spoiler at the bottom for what spawned this review from me.
[b]Is the issue resolved? Yes*[/b]

[b]Guns[/b]
Shotgun: you can shoot grenades, or burst-shots like a battlerifle
Pistol: ...
Heavy Assault Rifle: har har har. Sniper rifle mode, and rocket-volley mode.
Plasma Rifle: Basically a submachine gun with a shotgun or stun grenade underbarrel attachment.
Minigun: Flaming bullets, or double barrels, take your pick.
Rocket Launcher: you can shoot rockets that explode before they explode, but then still explode, or you can shoot 3 rockets at once.
BFG: almost as cool as the next gun on the list
Super Shotgun: This is a godmode item you unlock halfway through the game, with full upgrades this thing is just a delete-button for demons.

[b]Gun and Character Upgrades[/b]
The game rewards you for exploring levels to find secrets. Every secret you find gives you either Suit upgrade points, or weapon upgrade points. Spend these to max out your gear, ammo, armor, health, or weapon attachments.

Got all the attachments for a weapon? complete an optional challenge to unlock a Mastery upgrade.

[b]Badassery[/b]
Do you want to explode a demon with buckshot? Rockets? Bullet hell? Plasma? Your own bloodied fists? This game is for you.

[b]Level Design[/b]
The levels get kinda samey-same, but I still think they are [i]all[/i] beautifully designed, beautifully detailed, and sell the feel of the game. It's a very grungey Doom, compared to Doom Eternal's arcadey, colorful, shoot-a-demon.





[b]What was that about DRM at the start?[/b]
I do recommend you buy this game, this is a fun game and I think no one should miss out on a good shooter experience.

However, as outlined below, Steam made a booboo. The DRM had disabled a lot of my games, mostly Bethesda games. Apparently it also affected other games. This is the price we pay, this is what we agree to when we buy DRM protected games.

DRM is a protection/security method by which publishers protect their game from piracy. Often this requires an Online-Only state, even for ""Single-Player Only"" titles. 
Often this is a secondary background process that can lock out 5, 10, 20, 40% of your CPU resources, or maybe even GPU resources. 
DRM often has a direct effect on your game/computer performance during the game, lower FPS, input lag, and hardware depending it can cause stutters.
This is the accepted risk.

My advice stands. If there are legal DRM-Free options for a game, I highly recommend you seek them out. Humble Bundle, GoG, they usually do good work here.


[spoiler]Game is marked as pirated or something now, won't launch. Redirects to store page. Purchased legitimately through steam. Not the only game this happened to, seems only Bethesda titles so far. Doom 2016, Doom Eternal, Dishonored 2... Do not buy, it seems the keys might be illegitimate, or maybe it's just a glitch. I can't be sure. Consider alternative methods, GoG, Humble Bundle, if you're willing to gamble on doxxing yourself you could even consider directly buying from Bethesda.[/spoiler]"
i cant play the game  i pay the fulll price for it and download it but its sending me too the the store page where i can buy it why ????
"No longer working. I try to launch the games (as usual), and it just brings up an info page about the game in the Steam client instead of running the game."
this game is so fucking unpolished it's unbelievable
"TL;DR: Save your money and buy DOOM Eternal instead.

At first glance, DOOM 2016 (or DOOM 4, or the DOOM remake, or whatever you want to call it) seems like a dream come true for lovers of the franchise. With plenty of frenetic demon-slaughtering action.

And then you look past the nostalgic filter and realize, oh wait, this sucks.

The combat gets very same-y after a while with half the weapons being flashy at best but utterly useless past their challenges or introductory levels. I spent most of the game using just the combat shotgun for small demons and the rocket launcher for the big ones. The chainsaw is ludicrously impractical, and glory kills got very boring, very fast, since you only get 'diversity' in them if you actually aim the kill at a certain bodypart on the demon, rather than just letting the animation be randomized - nevermind the fact that there are limited animations for several demons which just feels cheap (looking at you, Mancubus). 

I thought the addition of an actual story and plot was interesting but it left me with more questions than answers - apparently the 'meat' of the plot is in DOOM Eternal instead, go figure. Probably should have saved my $8 and put it towards that one instead. There was plenty implied but not enough explained - why's Earth *got* an energy crisis so bad this cyborg thinks tunneling into Hell is a good idea, for one thing? What kind of stuff was Olivia Pierce offered by the demons if she basically fed her employees into Hell like a meatgrinder? A cure for her condition? Or something more? And *why* is Samuel just apparently okay with most of this? Nevermind *everything* with those templar knight guys.

The maps have good intentions, but they're so very...dull. The same industrial hallways or the same demonic catacombs, spattered in blood and runes, funneling you into arena fights with demon hordes. Exploring them feels pointless outside of completion/collectibility and I got lost on more than one occasion even with the expanded map because there's just so little diversity. The multiplayer had a lot more diversity.

And speaking of. Truth be told I could have just uninstalled, been slightly disappointed, but not been bothered enough to write out a whole review. But the Multiplayer. Is something goddamn else. 

With no matchmaking (enjoy being paired up with 2k+ hour veteran players when you're a level 1 scrub), NO ANTICHEAT, and most everything locked behind a progression system - I could understand the cosmetics being locked, but the various demons, runes, and weapons being locked behind level progression? Nevermind the fact that 99% of all said items are in fact useless - the rocket launcher and plasma gun are the only ones worth carrying, as are the Harvester demon and the Magnet rune. Trying to 'get good' is like running headfirst into a wall and hoping it eventually breaks before your skull does, and about as enjoyable.

The only way I got the achievements was, once I got the ones that actually took skill, I started AFK'ing in matches to leech EXP to unlock the armor piece ones. And you may be indeed be asking, why I would do this when this isn't exactly making things better?

Because there's no report system or votekick or any method to try and control how your matches go. Why bother trying if you know you're not going to be able to affect your outcome, because some top ten player grabbed four more of his top ten buddies for a little pubstomping? Or because some cheater decided to just go around insta-gibbing you for s#its and giggles?

No matchmaking I could understand, game's old, small population or whatever, but I'm honestly still trying to wrap my head around the fact that there's no anticheat whatsoever. Like good lord, how little do you have to care about your gamemode not to put in that at the bare MINIMUM????

There are so, so, SO many things in the Multiplayer that could have been put in the Singleplayer campaign to make it better. Gorgeous and more diverse maps (like Outbreak, Molten, Orbital, and Boneyard), various demons and weapons - hell, you could have AT LEAST made those things available in the Arcade mode, which just feels like the regular campaign but more boring. Who wouldn't want to play a Prowler hunting down other demons? Or dealing with one stalking you through the darkened halls of the UAC? Playing Infernal Run while being chased by a horde of pinkies?

""So you just want better Singleplayer, isn't that what SnapMap is for-"" AND YOU'D BE RIGHT IF SNAPMAP MODE HAD ANY OF THESE FEATURES, TOO! The limitations in that mode make creating any sort of interesting mini-campaign or private multiplayer map absolutely pointless. I've never seen a map editor that's so limited. Only two weapons? Only twelve enemies at a time? The game itself can handle rendering a hell of a lot more than that, why on *earth* did you put in those kinds of limitations?

In short, there's a lot of potential in DOOM 2016 that just completely and utterly falls flat. Whether because Bethesda or idSoftware or whoever didn't care enough, I don't know. 

But I'm thankful I only spent $8 instead of a full $60 like some people.

(You guys should have remade the Heretic/HeXen games instead.)"
"Data-Miner-EULA from take2. Game doesn't launch unless you add firewall rules for communication with take2 servers. 
No Deal, see you on gog."
"Bethesda knocks it out of the park with its hilarious parody of turning a real game into AAA garbage. Complete with armour upgrades, objectives, and I assume at some point there will be crafting: this game truly shows what would happen if someone tried to take a retro shooter and update it into a modern day piece of shit. A new seat at the table of avant-garde games; was it really worth the damage caused to a beloved franchise?"
"Boring.  Run around, shoot.  Bla bla bla.  Mindless and dull.  If I could get my money back I would, as this is the only game in my inventory that I truly regret spending money on.  It is visually awesome, but that sugar high lasts for about ten seconds until the sheer tedium of the truly vacuous play system kicks in.  The writing for what passes for a ""story"" is just as vacuous and stilted.  You can tell even the voice actors phoned it in.  What a piece of garbage."
:/
boring
It's hard to play and masturbate at the same time :(
[h1] TOO SCARY NOT FOR ME [/h1]
"Its an ok game with big maps and lots to find. But I don't like the combat/infiniate ammo from creatures.

The main down for me is that all rooms are so clean after you just killed tons of monsters. There is no proof that you've been there before.

I also dislike that monsters always spawn around you. I know its to save memory, but pff it just sucks. Let monsters be on the map since the start like the classic fps games."
Slow boring and lackluster compared to the Doom 2 modding community.
"Every level in story mode I played was riddled with bugs from not being able to shoot in a fps... to being stuck in the ground or some how being fused into other parts of the enviroment, i cannot look down and walk up anything and the character clips on almost everything on the ground. If it was once in a while I can understand but its every level..."
Somehow ripping aliens apart gets really old quite quickly.
The game would only play SDR on my 1440p 165hz monitor. It would look washed out and high contrast. Wouldnt play on my 4k 60hz monitor at all. Doom Eternal worked flawlessly on both my monitors.
Justice for Mick Gordon
"Honestly, I just can't get the hype. I played this on xbox one a little after launch and thought the same thing, (hence the low hours played). My friend who is very into Doom and its sequel Doom Eternal urged me to give the game a second shot now that I have a very powerful pc and it was majorly on sale and again I still don't see it. The plot is all over the place, environments are bland and repetitive, the gameplay to me, specifically the combat, is repetitive but its boring: most combat games you're focused on the kill, but with doom its all about injuring your enemy just enough where he doesn't die so you can then finish him off with an execution animation which have little variety. That approach seems like it could have been a strategical one but more times than not it comes off as more of a chore. 

Doom in principal is about feeling like a one man killing machine, yet in practice its about exploring, asking yourself ""where do i go?"", a lot of patience, going somewhat soft on your enemies, always watching your constantly low ammo, and a lot of platforming (despite being an fps).

If you want a game w a somewhat similar approach but performed better I'd recommend Wolfenstein instead."
"I am an old DOOM fan. I have to blast this for being overhyped.
The game itself is not bad, as the gameplay is designed to be pretty fast and destructive.

The campaign though is a horrible result of forced bad design.
It starts with maze maps, with very few VERY ill-placed checkpoints. Many times you will face the frustration of spending 20 minutes to run around and pick things up, face arenas, kill some extra demons, doing a rune challenge, die by trying a jump to a ledge that looked like the way to an important secret and having to do EVERYTHING again.
Then you learn from this and go forward ignoring secrets until you get a checkpoint but suddenly the door closes behind you and you can't get back anymore. It says ""Checkpoint...""

Doomguy starts horrible, slow and frail as he gets nuked by a simple imp charging a fireball from behind the corner. He takes too much time to vault over obstacles, he has NO ammo and has to rely on COOLDOWN BASED GRENADES and glory-killing everything to get health back and avoid wasting 2 extra shots on everything. Weapons start horrible and unsatisfying and enemies are unnecessarily bulky and require special glory-kill attention.

Then things start to change by 1/3 of the game, as levels start to get more and more like arenas safely connected by checkpoints that the designers couldn't fuck up. Upgrades make up for the horrible character to deliver the decent design that was intended. Ammo is plentiful and weapons are strong. Glory kills are not necessary anymore. Secrets are shown on the map so you avoid falling on invisible-walled ledges. Things start getting fun.

Then in the lategame things stop making sense, as upgrades push the game beyond the purpose of DOOM. You get INFINITE AMMO ROTATING TURRET CHAINGUN, ABSURD NUKE ROCKETS, ENDLESS 1 HIT-KILL RAILGUN, DOUBLE LIFE and other broken bullshit to face ever harder arenas.
The game at this point is basically trying to be Serious Sam but you have to jump around a lot. It is not DOOM anymore.

So when it tried to be DOOM it failed. When it tried to be Serious Sam it did a decent job.
From the sequel they said you can expect 50% more glory-kills so that's a pass for me.

Also, HOW THE FUCK DID A MODERN GAME FAIL TO DELIVER MANUAL SAVES?? This isn't even a hardware issue, nor a difficulty issue. It's just horrible design that promotes frustration on maze levels."
"Corrupt saves are a constant occurrence. I do not recommend to persons unwilling to tolerate glitchy behaviour.

Gameplay is great, but the game's data management will drop your progress constantly. Scavenger hunt unlocks are fun the first or maybe second time ... but the 10th time because Bethesda is stupid ... nope."
File keeps getting corrupted
multiplayer ttk too high
Doom just wasn’t for me.  Who am I?  Well I’m a guy who likes depth in his shooters. I like having multiple options for taking down foes.  I like being rewarded for cleverness.  Basically I wanted the whole toolbox. Doom is the best made hammer you can get.  I got it based on the extremely high praise it received. But if you are a person who wants more than just a hammer smashing a nail over and over then this won’t be for you either.
"This game is WAY too over-hyped and is in reality not very good. It's impressive technically for it being a 2016 game and, in my opinion, looks better than DOOM Eternal. The story is fucking stupid and just kinda thrown together; it lacks any point or meaning. The story just drags on and on for longer than it should. Everyone praises the hell out of the combat. THE COMBAT IS NOT GOOD. The enemies are bullet sponges that don't react to being shot. The melee is terrible, it doesn't push enemies or stun them, it's useless. The guns are not very well balanced, the pistol is useless, the combat shotgun is worthless after the super shotgun is found and the other guns feel useless. Grenades are just shit. There is little impact when an enemy is shot. If you want a better DOOM experience play brutal doom or something. I'm serious, brutal doom's combat is WAY more fun and punchy. Many of the levels look samey and are a pain in the ass to find out where to go. The DOOM from 1993 had this problem but I don't remember it being this bad. I wouldn't get this game, it has no replay value and is just kinda boring."
"I think this game is great, I think its fun and interesting, but I also find its gameplay loop to be very ungripping, especially next to Doom Eternal. This game did not keep my attention very long and despite me finding it very good, that alone is a cause for worry, dont you think?

I shouldnt ever just lose attention span to a game immediately like I did this one."
Runs like a piece of shit once you get to the hell levels.
Broken game. Crashes continuously 2 minutes in. No support. REFUNDED.
"meh, slow"
"Mixed feelings on this one, I wish Steam offered something more granular than just ""recommend"" & ""not recommend"", but here we are. There are certainly some of the parts of a rather good game here: a lot of the arena fights are exciting, the music is good, on ultra violence the difficulty felt just right. The main problem is that the levels are mostly just really bad. Once you are in an arena fighting demons it generally feels good because those are well designed, but other than that the levels all just feel really slow and awkward to move around in. Some of them straight-up just seem like they came out of a really shitty 3d platformer. Doom 1 & 2 has remained relevant for all this time in no small part because people keep making excellent WADs for it, so in that context it seems insane that THIS is the best they could manage for an actual new Doom. You want to think they get it, but it's just hard to imagine that being the case while playing through The Foundry or something.

The collectibles and upgrade system isn't  great either and largely feels like a distraction from the meat of the game, but those are trivial complains next to the levels. There's clearly an audience since this game ended up being popular, but idk who I would recommend this to. Certainly not fans of Doom or other classic shooters."
"I had more fun just playing modded Doom 1 and 2. The OST is good and there is couple of guns that were fun.
The Super Shotgun sucks and the possessed raped my ears. I just wanted to kill demons but this robo dude just keeps talking about some stupid story. Not for me 6/10"
"Excellent controls, fun weapons, cool monsters. In single-user... pointless hunting and infuriating climbing puzzles with arbitrary level designs that offer little sense of progress, with lots of non-interactive literal junk -- machines, debris, non-operative doors, etc. -- that add nothing to the game except to demand more pointless hunting. Add to that a confusing map system and inane challenges that distract from the completion of missions. Then on top of that, a dead-end boss leaving you stuck with no way to advance or restart from a previous bookmark other than the last autosaved completion point (or begin from scratch). I haven't played Doom or other FPSs in many years, and I'm astounded at how little improvement I see. The original Doom had atmosphere, dread, and clearly understandable missions that made it creepy and fun. Doom (2016) has moments of great fun when clearing a level of monsters, with awesome battle gameplay, but it ultimately progresses to frustration and then boredom."
this game is ass!!!!!
bad gam
"Played for half an hour then exited the game. Came back to play and it all my settings in video settings and keybinds went back to default and dev mode has been activated on my campaign. Found complaints online about dev mode being forced onto people and it corrupts saves, these complaints were made in 2016 so it's not fixed. asking for support from bethesda is fruitless so hopefully some passerby can tell me how to fix it."
.
"Allready played Brutal Doom mod before this came out, got bored quick."
"Game is constantly closing mid game play since the new update
please fix
this game brings me peace"
"I've played this game for a while, but now it won't launch.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  To many glitches"
"Gets repetitive way too fast (you can see battles from a mile away and can predict the enemies youll face in order ).
-Spoiler, once you encounter armored mancubus, they usually appear by the end of battles
Some battles drag for too long and become boring and since you can only save in checkpoints you will have to re do the whole thing if you die.
Most weapons are useless - only useful weapons are normal shotgun, machinegun, plasma gun, rocket launcher and BFG
Most weapon mods are useless, so dont feel bad if you cannot find all the stupid robots
Enemies are not difficult, just annoying especially imps and summoners.
Zombies with shields are a higher threat than Hell Knights for some reason.  
Platforming is awful ( like in any FPS to be fair )
This is the first Doom I have played were the super shotgun is actually WORSE than the normal shotgun.
Enemies can bug and become invulnerable when ""staggered"" only being killed by glory kills or heavy weapons (more noticeable on cacodemons).
Boss battles are gimmicky, easy and boring.(take too long)
Only fight the cyberdemon once and once he is dead never comes back (like in doom 3)
Only fight Mastermind once.
""""New boss"""" is copy pasted 3 times.
Story is bonkers and halts gameplay like in Doom 3 but this time is actually WORSE than Doom 3 because this Doom is fast paced so the sudden stop for story exposition is more noticeable.
Doom """"Slayer"""" is inconsistent in his behavior, sometimes dont listening to explanations (to appear badass) but then waits patiently while the enemy slowly escapes to an elevator or to listen to the exposition 
All in all... not a BAD game per se but I am so glad I got it on discount.
Played in Ultra Violence, beat it but I dont think Ill replay it.
Lost hype for Eternal but will buy it on discount... for like 5 bucks... after playing this It will be easy to wait for sale."
"Now that there is eternal i can finally leave the purgatory of whether to give positive and negative rating and say go to play eternal guys.
that one is just better in all the ways"
"This is a great example of how not to implement a story. You need at least enough story for people to care and want to uncover more... I still have no clue what is going over an hour in, and all I have done is collect colored key after colored key to open a door... Snore fest 2016, that would have been better off as a horde mode in another title as a bonus option."
"It's a decent game, and I enjoyed it at first, but it started to feel repetitive after awhile."
really fun game but it freezes constantly on my powerful pc along with several other issues. Just get it for console where you don't have to deal with any technical bulllshit
How is this so critically acclaimed? It's one of the most boring games I've ever played. Refunded.
"A fun Rip-and-Tear FPS marred by poor level/progression design and a heavy platforming focus.

Combat: Good.  Its fast, mobile, and promotes swapping between multiple weapons to deal with varied threats. 

Story: Acceptable. More than good enough for a combat-focused FPS. 

Graphics: Decent quality, the levels are fine, nothing special and nothing amazing. The demons are the main highlights, along with a few NPC designs. 

Audio: Combat music is fun DOOM music, non-combat music is acceptable. Some guns feel a little weak in the sound and feedback.

Performance: No issues, does not seem to stand out on either end of the optimization scale. 

Bugs: Clipped through the map several times, often when doing a glory kill. Crashed to desktop 2 times when reloading a checkpoint, but the save worked fine after relaunching the game both times.

Movement: Standard wasd movement, nothing special aside from the addition of a doublejump. unfortunately, the doublejump is a little lacking for the level of platforming and mobility needed to reach some parts of certain levels. Its enough, but deaths due to slight missaiming or timing are irritating and frustrating, killing the flow of the game.

Progression: The main problem lies here. Progression is driven by finding secrets and items hidden around the map, usually requiring platforming or backtracking to get them all. However, its hard to tell *when* you can access a specific secret area, as sometimes you need keys or to complete objectives, but many other times completing the objectives will *prevent* backtracking, meaning anything you missed under the assumption it was unlocked later is now unobtainable. 

This promotes trying to jump and platform around at everything that seems even potentially reachable, every time you complete a single objective, lest your next action lock you out from getting the items. Naturally, since a lot of the places (but not all) require unlocking through objective progression, this means many deaths as you fall off the map (either because you messed up, or because the place was actually unreachable) and have to reload. 

The alternative method of trying to clear the map and then go around and looting it worked in the first few levels, but then there was usually events that prevented backtracking, quite often in forms that were hard to anticipate, leaving the player suddenly locked out. While getting everything on the map *is* unneeded and excessive, the quantity of missed upgrades and lore bits is quite significant, more than half in several cases. It snowballs further when mission challenges are tired to finding all of a specific item on a level, denying even more progression. 

Adding in several occasions of clipping through the map, one time skipping most of a level and all the items and objectives inside it, and the experience of the fun, fast-paced combat is heavily dragged down by either slow, boring slogs of trying to check all the places on the map over and over again, or just a sinking feeling as most of the items and loot is skipped and missed. 

On the bright side, it does appear that shrugging, following the story, and just looting whatever is painfully obvious along the way.. is pretty viable. All those upgrades, mods, and general fun/optimization is not needed to complete the game. Just a shame that the times I did achieve 90-100% of the secrets and items in a level, it required me to spend at least 5x more time exploring, jumping, dying, reloading, and being frustrated compared to the actual combat."
"Meh.

It's a mindless gory shooter that is fine when it works. Sadly, like all first person shooters that try to add platforming, that's just bad.

I'm also running into a lot of jank. Not unexpected for a Bethesda game, I suppose. For example I just got stuck in the menu for the second time because the escape key wasn't exiting like it should have done. There's been other times when I haven't jumped when I should have done, been stuck on geometry that has messed up a jump, etc.

Glad I picked this up on sale, and it definitely hasn't done a good job of selling me on the sequel."
doesnt load.. what a jip
"The game as a whole seems like it would be a lot of fun, but the graphics settings don't save when changed. This means if you have struggles with a lower end computer or can't use certain effects like Motion Blur, then you're locked in. And I haven't been able to find a solution fast enough. Refunding before I surpass Steam's 2 weeks was the only option for me sadly."
Stale and boring.
"I was interested in this game because a few friends played it. BUT

SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  No matter where you are in the beginning, there is CONSTANT demon noise! So you are unable to determine if where they are coming from and IF there are any enemies in the area. I wasn't able to get ""scared or nervous"" because it was constant and out of place.
I hope to have the spare time to try this game again. WIsh I had saved my money for a different game I wanted to try."
"Felt cool at first but becomes tedious fast. However the biggest sin is that halfway through the game you get a rune upgrade (Rich Get Richer) which gives you infinite ammo if your armor is at max (or half if upgraded). I just end up spamming the charged railgun. The enemies most of the time won't be able to touch you, let alone reduce your armor to below that.

Pros:
+ Nostalgic enemy visual design.
+ Weapon visual design and classic mid-screen placement.
+ Exploration and secrets.

Cons:
- ""Rich Get Richer"" rune, see above.
- Gameplay loop is boring and repetitive: Enter arena, gates close, monsters spawn, sometimes there is a power-up, monsters die, gates open, repeat.
- Weapons feel weak, damage feedback on monsters is too subtle, it's like you're punching at water. Some have weak points, but after finishing the game, still can't tell what they are.
- Damage feedback on self is almost non-existent, to the point where I never know when I'm hit or what my health level is. Original Doom had the bloodied up face and pain sounds.
- Sound design is terrible: Possessed zombie growls overlap and are very loud, as if they are right in your ear. The non-combat music is too quiet and repetitive, and makes you realize just how lifeless the world is.
- Environments are unremarkable: It's either techno facility or hellish ruins. They are not interactive, no physics, object are basically bolted to the ground. Arenas looks like they are designed for multiplayer DM.
- Boss battles are designed pretty badly, except for maybe a short section against the Cyberdemon. It's always a small round arena.
- NPC characters are bland. Just like Doomguy, you won't really care about them. Having their ""monologues"" (Doomguy doesn't talk himself) inserted into story beats just slows the pace down.

It is by no means a bad game, just a dull one. Was excited for Doom Eternal, but this slog only convinced me to remove it from my wishlist. I would rather play Unreal 2."
"I like this game but it isnt the old school Doom. This is a jump puzzle from hell, with some demons thrown in. I was killed more times missing jumps than by the silly demons. The story is cool, I beat the game and now uninstalled. It isnt worth another trip threw hell.The jumping bs is mind numbing. Get it if its on sale for a good story, then forget it"
Game run poorly or lags. no success loading saved campaigns and glitches all over the map. Tried redownloading it and same exact issues. I don't know what happened over the weekend but this game is in serious need of repairs. wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.
I love the Doom series. I enjoyed the gameplay. Alot of the errors and bugs for me sadly. That made me uninstall. Error after error.. please fix before releasing a new game.
"It is really sad the multiplayer is dead.
The singe player is ok ig?"
All video games are abhorrent and DooM is one of the most nefarious examples
ill pass not fun.
"Mechanics are a lot less fluid compared to DOOM Eternal, difficulty curve is simply inhumane (even though I did play on Nightmare, getting oneshot from full HP feels incredibly unfair and unrewarding -- something DOOM Eternal does not do, while still maintaining the signature challenging gameplay). 
Please do yourselves a favor and just play DOOM Eternal for the superior experience."
Die-Hard DOOM Fan since i was kid when the original came out. This is Okay. Not best DOOM but over all its a good game. Go Play Eternal and skip this one if you haven't played before.
Multiplayer really pisses you off
"Apparently they deleted my original review.

I had horrible input lag making this game unplayable."
"polished to perfection
non-existent story
okay gameplay
boring overcompressed music
2 fun guns, the rest are for a last ditch effort
green lights do the hand holding
acceptable optimization
AAA price
mere 8 hours of campaign (I played blind)
too easy and forgiving"
"Hmm, nah.

I'm old enough to have enjoyed the first two Doom titles when they came out. Doom II deathmatch was among the first titles I've played over a dialed 14k4 modem.

I thought this one would have anything that resembled the atmosphere of these early titles. It doesn't. While the ancient titles were dark and gritty, this one is just... cartoony. 

Game mechanics are also meh. Pseudo-rpg elements were included but are stupidly lackluster. gun play is unfortunately just not satisfying, and you're either moving around way too fast to even stop and notice the enemy or you're wasting time while mindlessly shooting inoffensive zombie-like dudes who won't fight back.

tl;dr: not total garbage by any means, but not good either and a title I could have easily passed without any loss.

ps: soundtrack is pretty good though."
"bad, this game gave me nausea"
"Got to the part where I'm supposed to go to a security station to open a door that is between me and the objective. Map doesn't say what is what, just a bunch of blank rooms. Of my time playing 50% was spent looking for where to go, 20% trying to make sense of all the pop ups/info dump, and maybe 30% on actual gameplay. They throw a bunch of info at you, but no hints on where to go if you get stuck, would not recommend for new players. There's a chance I'm just a moron, but I do not appreciate getting stuck in a game and having 0 clue of where to go to progress."
"game crashes randomly when loading, corrupting save game making you have to start a new game was 7 hours in when this happened do feel like starting over again when there still is no fix"
"One boring and chaotic game. The upgrade system seems fun, but I don't wanna explore this dull boring world. I've seen worse, but it's still straight bad. 2/10"
booooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggg. Get it on sale and waste your life for nothing.
"Not recommended, as it requires to accept an EULA… *after* downloading the game…"
"Lacks the action-atmosphere of the original, plays more like Doom3 then Doom 1 or 2."
"Toxic masculinity in a nutshell

How do we force these cis white pigs to add BBW and sodomites to the game?"
"Make no mistake, Doom is certainly not a bad game. But would i recommend it to a friend? No. Doom 2016 simply isn't what I expect from a good FPS. It's too convoluted, boring the player with its upgrade and rune system, which boils down to limiting the players ability in the first levels. A Doom FPS should be about skill, not not about paternalizing the player.

Apart from that, Doom 2016 lacks the run, gun and dodge spirit the original and Quake made so gut wrenching fast and uncompromising. You are slow, a walking tank brawling its way through the levels, forced to get into close combat basically all the time. It took a while until i realized that something irked me - which turned out to be a lackluster implemented hit feedback. I only realized i got hit severely, when my health was already down to being a one hit, which defied any attempts of health management. 

And that's not an oversight: The devs wanted to force the player into the glory kill system, basically taking away the choice of an indiividal play style. When Doom 2 gave you the choice to go in OR keep your distance, Doom 2016 forces you to go in.

But what really took the fun away from me, are the ubiquitous arena combats. Basically Doom 2016 is an arena shooter: You walk into a confined space, doors shut behind you, monsters spawn in.

Spawn in.

Say good bye to any atmosphere, to any need of paying attention to your environment. It's not necessary, as the level designers never even decided to worry about monster placement. Why planning ahead if you can spawn in monsters AND supply the player with ammunition via chainsaw kills? That's lazy, uninspired and in stark contrast to the quality of mods still produced for Doom and Quake up this very day.

Not that the modding community has a chance to prove better with Doom 2016: It's nailed shut, only offering the build in snap map editor.

So my final verdict is: If you are fine with a polished, albeit rather generic FPS experience set in Sci-Fi and hell environment: Go for it. For five bucks you'll get plenty of shooting. But if you were searching for a spiritual successor for Doom or Quake:

Go to doomworld or quaddicted. And if mods can't sate your hunger, try our Wrath: Aeon of Ruin and mod it to your satisfaction."
"tbh its like wolfenstein with less story, great graphics fast paced but quite a generic shooter i could see me playing for about 20h and then not touching it for ages, used to love oldschool doom but this isnt for me"
Expected more cool game from Id software
"its probably good, it just makes me so fucking dizzy."
It's not really a shooter this is more like run and jump simulator. They should call it Quake 3: Singleplayer. Doesn't feel like Doom in any way.
"The soundtrack is killer, but the fact that there is never a time when there is not at least some sort of soundtrack makes it easy to automatically tune out the soundtrack and not notice it when it kicks into a good track. My other main gripe is that the sound feedback is very bad. Weapons that are supposed to feel powerful do not sound powerful, nor is their sound satisfying to hear when you fire them, ultimately making the game feel like you are winning because the opponents are weak, not because you are powerful. If you like arcade shooters then you will probably like the game, but I personally was quite disappointed in it, and cannot recommend it based on my experience (which is a shame, because the soundtrack really is awesome and I listen to it outside of gaming)."
"Ok, this is probably a pretty unpopular opinion, and I accept that, but this is still how I personally feel.

Don't get me wrong, DOOM 2016 is amazing in a lot of aspects. In fact, I got this game in sale just to give it a fair chance. Its graphics and music are simply amazing! The level design is decent as well. And while the gameplay is where I find most faults, I still have to admit that it's really smooth and user-friendly.

But, on to why I just can't like DOOM 2016. These are also the reasons why I just can't like the original Doom series either (with the exception of DOOM 3). Overall, the gameplay all boils down to a whole lot of 'jump>shoot>glory kill' repetitions, with a bunch of obnoxious searching in literal nooks and crannies if you care about the collectables. It's a game where you just turn your brain off and practically hold the W and left-click buttons (not quite that literal, but you get my point). There's no variation in its gameplay, no depth, just kick and punch and shoot all the way to the end. Add to that the almost non-existant storyline, and I really just can't bring myself to be interested while playing this game.

Overall, like I said, a lot of good aspects in DOOM 2016, but the constant gameplay loop and poor story just makes it a very boring game to me."
"If you own a razer keyboard & mouse
then dont even think about playing this game
since it will screw up your light effects each time you go play
and only option in game shuts all lights off instead = not better at all"
"The game is graphically slick and features a nice player skill/weapon progression system, with an incentive to explore each level fully.

However, at heart it's a dungeon crawl (set on Mars with guns) with most of the action taking place in set arena battles against waves of spawning enemies.

That's pretty much it.

If you like that sort of thing, I'm told that Doom 2016 is one of the best examples on the market.

As for me, I got stuck fairly early on in the game at a set battle that I couldn't survive. I came back to the game about two years later to try again, and found that I was still stuck. As a teenager, I could take on Doom 1 and Doom 2 on Ultra-Violent difficulty level and enjoy the challenge. As an adult in my middle age, I have better things to do with my time than keep dying repeatedly trying to prove myself the equal of a game designer's challenge.

Will our intrepid Space Marine hero survive the demonic onslaught on humanity's Tharsis base on Mars to triumph amid gore and plunder?

In a word: no. And that's the end of my Doom 2016 journey."
"Video Games are just horrible, theyre not even good"
"I was almost done with the Campaign by the time I couldn't handle this game bs, the further along you go in the campaign the more the game unravels and the worse it becomes. If I would've reviewed the game after my first couple plays where I hadn't even gotten half way through I would've left a great review but as I got further in the game stopped running well (missiles passing through enemies  taking damage when not hit explosive damage that I should be immune to damaging me certain elite guards being obsurdly difficult to get to due to not well tested secret spot design etc.). My least favorite are the runes beside being rng hell they were extremely buggy for me, hell knights would ground pound and damage me from long range and most projectiles would curve twords me some like the imp curve normally but I don't think the possessed soldiers energy shot curves. I bought this game on sale for 7 dollars and I kind of regret it, 23 hours of play time isn't enough to justify the hard drive space this thing took up,"
"Best shooter? Best shooter.

Edit: Bethesda is a trash company that will try its hardest to be a stereotypically villainous corporation wherein the rats in exec and management will try their hardest to sink their reputation and mistreat its employees for a chance to steal your leftover change.

What they did to Mick Gordon is one of the most base and insensible things I've seen come out of the games industry. Do not support this behaviour. Do not support their games. And for the love of what is good, do not support this conglomeration of reta.rds."
"I could go into a very lengthy review, telling you why I don't like this game.

Instead, I'll just say that I don't like modern shooters, and this is a bad shooter. Low skill, mindless enemies, and ""Rip and Tear!"" that while sounds cool at first, really just translates to a stupid idea at platforming. Brutal DOOM is frankly better then this, along with having better music, and the gunplay is unsatisfying.

The game overall in my honest opinion is perfectly ""average"" for a modern shooter, does nothing interesting or revolutionary, and overall is likely only popular because of the lack of decent singleplayer FPS titles and bringing the DOOM franchise."
"The game has so many issues I'm forced to give this game a negative review.

It has nice graphics and decent gameplay, but a lot of times it starts with the wrong resolution, sometimes it doesn't start all (eg: I play the game just fine but when I come back to play again a few hours later the game doesn't start), sometimes some keyboard inputs don't work; I know it's not a problem with my PC because other games run fine and none of the fixes I tried worked for this game. 
Gameplay has good things like being able to carry all weapons and fast pace but things like jumping puzzles ruin gameplay, rune trials are stupid and sometimes unfairly difficult even on the lowest difficulty settings, some levels feel repetitive, and certain aspects of multiplayer feel out of place in a Doom game such as restrictions on loadouts, the whole level up & unlocking stuff. Also the game requires constant internet connection to play custom matches against bots, which imo is a terrible design choice. Some achievements are glitched and don't unlock.

Unfortunately all the negative aspects negate any positives the game may have."
"what a piece of shit game ... Eternal is for kiddies ... this is a shit game .. and doom 3 yes that is a game ... i payd 20 euro FOR a shit game .. and i will not buy eternal i prefer patched ,,, FREE ... ""anyones"" first reaction when you install with a bug .. after the reinstall all gone 100% as it should ... this is present even in DOOM 3 in HELL again same thing there .. i must reinstal DOOM 3 to pass the level :)"
"I got this game because it was recommended to me as a somewhat newer game with decent graphics that actually has regular non-team deathmatch online play, which is hard to find anymore since the game companies seem to want to focus on team play.  Nobody is playing Doom online.  I can wait for an hour in the lobby and nobody shows up.  It doesn't matter what time of day or night, it doesn't matter what region I set, NOBODY shows up, making this game utterly worthless for multiplayer, which was the only reason I bought it."
"terrible compatability, doesnt work, multiple corrupted files, changes my aspect ratio, wont work on my screen, only uses 110 of the screen, cant fix, wouldnt recommend to myworst enenemy, never experienced this many problems from a single game in my entire life, atleast i could blow on my n64 cartridges, wont ever ourcahse anything from this developer again"
"It was really engaging until the game crashed almost every time I encountered a loading screen. Saw some suggested solutions online, couldn't get them to work. Unfortunately the joy is now as dead as the hordes of demons that lie behind me."
They didnt let Mick Gordon Finish his soundtrack  thats why
the cars in this game are bad... I hate driving... #zzzzzz
"The game crashes after you save the game and log out.  It will not let you load the saved game.  Also when you start a new game, it will only let you start three times and then you are locked out of the game with no possibility of starting a new game."
"The game is a console port, it's too slow. Moreover, there is no mod support and I can't use /timescale to speed up the game.
You are better off playing Serious Sam Fusion instead."
i cant play this game anymore since its not opted into GeforceNOW
"Eh, does not live up to the hype honestly."
"To be honest with you, I don't really like Doom that much, yeah it's fast paced but, I feel as if there's no meaning or substance to it. It's like a kid on drugs wanting to go fast. As sorry as this sounds, it's a no for me, I just don't like it. I cant get into it."
"I loved this game when I first got it. It was fun, fast paced, and chock full of hidden secrets, violence, and the stuff DOOM is known for. 
However, I do not recommend this game right now, as my not even month old PC, that is stronger then the PC I previously played DOOM on many years ago, crashed to a blue screen not even 30 minutes after loading up the game. Which never has happened to me before on any other game, on any other PC. Only DOOM 2016 has made me blue screen."
too much gore lol trying too hard to be edgy?
"Great engine but boring game, glory kills are dumb as fuck and most enemy encounters are happening in arenas, the soundtrack is the worst part of this game, most of the tracks are this one note garbage.

This game has no actual modding support, this is a doom game goddamnit, what the fuck are you guys at ID doing."
"I cannot understand why this game has such a positive reputation. Graphically it's pretty good, the frame rate is excellent, the sound is rubbish and it has to be the shallowest, most boring gaming experience I've ever had. I tried it on Xbox back in 2016 and didn't last long then. I recently built my first gaming PC and after reading all the positive reviews about this game I thought I'd give it another go. 

Waste of time and money. It is so simplistic it's sleep enducing. Back to Titanfall 2. Not that is a good game."
"Functional singleplayer, but underwhelming, and empty multiplayer.

It took a long time until I was capable of running the game smoothly. It looks good, but requires decent hardware. The singleplayer is a huge improvement in the series when compared to Doom 3, although it lacks detailed settings like an option for hold to crouch (and a button for grenades?) The audio could be improved, for example some of the explosions sounded like a quiet sneeze. The gunplay had some satisfaction to it, but not as satisfying as the guns in Killing Floor 2.

The campaign didn't grip me at all. It felt unintuitive; I frequently got lost or couldn't figure something out and had to watch a playthrough, but the playthroughs weren't much help because a lot of the game looks the same, so there's not much of a reference point like landmarks to help navigate yourself. There's an in-game map, but somehow it just felt equally as confusing.

I wasn't eager to keep playing it. I actually felt tired from aimlessly strolling around what felt like a badly lit maze that all looks the same, hoping to stumble on a keycard, while being slowed down by menu popups for weapon/suit upgrades that I didn't feel interested in. Certain things were confusing, like killing with a chainsaw drops ammunition that can't seem to be picked up?

The base gameplay is refreshingly straightforward in a lot of places - just let the player progress and give them new guns and things to shoot. But it wasn't that interesting. It's almost a little bit too brainless (when it wasn't outright confusing), as I don't feel like there's much skill involved. It's possible to do interesting things in a game that has simple foundations (like Half Life) where there are clearly lots of skillsets involved.

It's like Doom wanted to capture the original fun of shooting demons in Doom, but also add a storyline, but it fails completely because you can't just jump in to do some shooting. Now you have to be slowed down by the story, but the story itself is bland and forgettable. The graphics are impressive, but if that's the only selling point then it doesn't offer much value.

When I tried the multiplayer there was only one other player, and it didn't start a match. I'm pretty neutral on this game, I'd recommend to try it if it was free, but honestly for £14.99 i think you'd find better value elsewhere. It's not groundbreaking like the original namesake was. Killing floor 2 probably had more playability and a greater variety of weapons (and a more active playerbase).

I felt like it was supposed to be a prominent title, but it doesn't meet the hype."
BAD
"I've been a huge fan of DOOM even including DOOM 3. To me, this game was pretty boring. 

Move into a room, room locks, bad guys spawn, kill bad guys, room unlocks, move to the next room... Repeat with (maybe) a new kind of bad guys. 

The graphics are decent and if you just like to shoot and shoot and shoot (and shoot...) then I guess this game is for you. If it goes on super-sale for $3 or something, I might buy it again. There just isn't enough substance to justify full price.

EDIT: And I did, in fact, get it on super sale after getting it refunded when I left this review. I'm happy with it for $5 but would not recommend paying full price for it in the slightest."
"It looks good. It sounds good. I thought I'd like it. I wanted to like it. But I got bored. It felt like a tedious, repetitive slog. It was almost there but maybe they made too many concession to modern gamers. I don't know but I'd rather play the Brutal Doom mod for old-school Doom. I can't recommend this for fans of the original."
it's so booooooooooorrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiing
SHIT
"Not sure how this game managed to get so many positive reviews - it forces you through 6-8 hours of unskippable wave combat, followed by an obnoxious puzzle. The community will most likely defend it, but this is insulting game design."
"The most boring FPS game I've played in a long time. After playing for a little while, I had to remove the game once again after having installed it twice. You just follow the path, fire generic monsters, and press F to finish them and collect health and ammo, then repeat till the end. There is no storyline, only a few cutscenes, and the enemy AI is braindead. The game will quickly get boring for you."
"Great Soundtrack
one hit wonder with mishandled multiplayer"
"i remember my first gameplay of doom 3 this was first doom game which i played it on xbox console, the experience was scary but at same time ass kicking it gave you certain feeling that you were actually in hell fighting demons, now days its just arcade type of gun and run boring repetitive with no scary moments, every boss fight is seems like made for 3years old kid who can rip through them but game itself is visually very good and eye candy thats all in this now days doom game can offer, the game has lost its meaning and is not according to its name what its meant to be  you no more feel like your ""DOOMED"" to hell.!!!! thats why i gave thumbs down"
"Its shit and the shotgun is trash and underwhelming. Don't buy it buy eternal

Shit ass game waste of fucking money"
gets boring fast
"i finished the game the first thing i have to say is this game is not bad ! 
it is good but  i dont like it 
you know when you see a game and think yeah this is a good game but  i dont feel i will like it no mater what"
"Don't buy this game, because it's Bethesda.

It's too bad, because this was a fun game. I had fun playing it.

But Bethesda has too much of a history of fucking over their customers, both when the game's released _and_ after the fact. I can't recommend anyone buy a game from them, because I don't know how they might screw you over in the future, and I don't want to encourage people to support a shitty company.

If I could give you my copy of this game, to avoid someone else purchasing it, I would."
:(
"I honestly could not have much fun with this game. I know everyone thinks very highly of it, but when I played it was just another basic shooter with slow movement. Is it polished, yes, but It's an experience I can get anywhere else. It's just shoot bad guys in one room and move on to the next, nothing that groundbreaking or enjoyable for me."
"Doom (2016) is the best shooter and the worst AAA game of decade.

Thanks to my huge backlog of games i was unable to finish this game till now, despite the fact that i bought it way back at release day... So there are my [strike]shitty[/strike] [i]trashy[/i] review:

- The graphics here is pretty simple (vs old ass Crysis 2/3 for examle) and the hell just feels like some kind of hellish planet but not a terrifying world of pain and agony. The UAC-facilty level design is just a lazy copy/paste by 70-80% with some [i]trashy[/i] platforming jump puzzles and the hell is a copy/paste by 90-95%.

- And these gameplay ""loops"" where you just repeat the same actions over and over until [strike]your eyes bleeds[/strike] they let you leave the room - it is so lazy and stupid idk what to say.

- Music. Heh, i'd say it also [i]trash[/i] but i'm not a heavy metal fan anyways.

- Even that primitive story is a [i]trash[/i] too, i finished this game only to see nothing at the end. And i mean literally nothing, just one dead erm... one dead boss.

That ending did not give me a sense of completion but a feeling of frustration. Open ending you will say? More like [i]trash[/i]-ending. Now i am supposed to buy Doom Eternal to see the real ending? Nah, play that aswesome game without me.

I don’t even understand why is this game is so highly rated. Just because of the shooting mechanic? Well that would be too generous. Must be not my kind of game. Or i am an alien. From dem Mars!

4/10, okay 5/10 at max

[i]Sincerely, your Quake 2(!) and Doom (2004) fan.[/i]"
"They forcing update with virus anti-cheat on doom eternal. That is why I can not recommend any of their game.
NOT SURE IF I EVER BUY ANY GAME FROM THEM IN A FUTURE"
"Incredibly repetitive and boring, a lot of jumping and bugs. I thought nothing could be more boring than doom 3, but hey, id managed again. Finishing daemon can end up you with falling through the textures and die. Utter rubbish."
overhyped bethesda trash
Shitty checkpoint system and lack of quick save make this a no go for me.
"I really tried to enjoy it once. After a while I tried again. I just can't... It's extremely boring for me.
I don't like constantly caring about ammo and the idea of approaching and watching same finishers to recover health. I watched some late gameplay on youtube and it looks differently, but I'm not going to sacrifice."
"honestly unbeatable, what the hell... they broke it with updates, and hehehe, seriously you get to a point in this and just climbing a wall makes death, lol... emm hahahaha, can I have my money back please ? :)... lol... I asm playing on ultra violence but they took away all my weapons, all my upgrades, am near the end ... it is not the demons killing me, lol.... I destroy them... even with just a pistol, hahaha... but ummm, I climb something and screen goes red and says I died.... emmmm.... hahahhahaa... learn how to code bethesda, so tired of this"
"Tried to play this game twice. I forgot why I only lasted 3hrs the first time. Until I just downloaded it again. The start of the game is extremely boring. I cannot attest to further than 3hrs in, but it doesn't deserve more time imo. The starting weapon does nothing except stun / stagger. Therefore you are constantly having to stagger and press F to do some ""special effects"" melee kill which consists of punching or poking their eyes out. Very repetitive. The next weapon they give you is a shotgun. Great right? No. Point blank range and it still staggers instead of kills 90% of the time. To top it off they only give a max of 20 rounds so you are constantly searching for ammo. The first upgrade for a weapon you get is about 30 mins in and i chose a more focused shot from the shotgun. A charge shot where it concentrates the blast. I was hoping this would at least kill something. Yet again, no it doesn't 1 shot kill. Still 20 round max - still looking for more ammo so I can 2 shot every enemy, or press F for more of the same 2 or 3 visually animated kills. To top it off the new upgraded shotgun has about 3-4 seconds in between each shot. So you have 5 enemies attacking you and you have to wait 4 seconds between charged shots. I'll go find another fps where a point blank shotgun can kill your typical entry level enemies."
"Now, how would you like [u]Denuvo anti cheat[/u] in your single player Doom 1, 2, 64 and 3 ?. [h1]You don't.[/h1] 

SO LET ME PLAY DOOM ETERNAL SINGLE PLAYER WITHOUT IT! [h1]I DON'T DO MULTIPLAYER[/h1]"
"The combat music just doesn't play. there is minor build up when demons spawn in, and then just ambient ""world noise"". Very poor considering the reason I bought the game was for the soundtrack"
"Wasted 20 dollars because my OS can't run it and I can't refund it because the policy, the game is good, the refund policy isnt"
"After years of buying this game. I really had high hopes for it. ran like shit on pc. 
My gaming rig can handle all AAA games.
Sadly this game couldn't get past the 16fps mark. no matter what setting I had it on."
"Kinda boring

Shoot wait for shiny then punch then repeat it too many times, some visuals are cool and the soundtrack is good."
"The game sucks ass. It is so repetitive that it will make you lose actual brain cells. Shoot at enemy, wait for shiny animation, press super cool execute button and watch one of three execution animations that you will see around 500.000 times during your playthrough. Rinse and repeat this in Maps that have absolutely no charm and all look the fucking same. The guns feel weightless and gunplay is incredibly bad for a game that only has gunplay going for it. The music in this game is laughable and is supposed to make you feel like the ultimate badass. In reality, it makes me feel ashamed for playing this. As you probably already know, the ""story"" is total garbage and can barely be described as a story, but I guess that is part of the franchise. Rarely was I so disappointed by a game, and I only had mediocre expectations going into it. Even if you are just looking for an FPS Game to shoot at some shit, which is what I was doing when buying the game, then this will still be a disappointment due to the bad maps, cringey music and the unexciting weapon handling.

If you are not a DOOM fanboy and you like to have your brain stimulated at least a little bit while playing games, then this won't be worth your time.

Edit: Its 2023 and this game is still one of the most painfully overhyped games I have ever seen."
It's boring.
"Lets play DOOM. its parkor with constant double jumps , then fight demons in a arena till  their dead, then hit button to open door to new parkor place , then shoot demons in arena till all are dead to activate button to advance to new parkor challange. the defend against demons in a arena ...........ete."
"Deliberately corrupting save files for using the dev console or using any kind of cheats is the most obnoxious pathetic shit I have ever seen from a game developer.

If they think this game is such a work of art that people cant possibly be allowed to mess with it... well they're dumb as hell. The game is just kill the monsters in a room, door opens, repeat for 8 hours. Sure its fun. But why cant we cheat? Why are the developers so precious?"
This game is not Doom.   I don’t know what it is.  You play Masterchief in CoD style combat with Mortal Kombat finishers.
"There were 3 times in the game where i truly enjoyed myself, and they were all times i clipped out of the map with a glory kill"
"If you like platformers. Weee, jump, jump, jump, solve puzzles and die in fire-filled cramped levels. I thought this was a game about shooting demons. Seriously by the time I got to the foundry, I quit. Not even enough interest to get to see what cacodemons look like."
"This is a brain-dead power fantasy. If you're looking for an exciting and terrifying game about the battle against demonic legions from hell, don't buy this. Instead get Doom 1 & 2 and download the ""brutal doom"" mod. If you prefer a game where there's no sense of danger because your enemies are more like annoying little mosquitoes than scary, deadly monsters...play this. I found it very disappointing."
"It should be ""It's ok but"" but Steam reviews as binary as Heaven-Hell concept.
I was forcing myself to complete it so I can give my opinion. You can definitely get it on discount.
What is wrong?
- for arena based shooter you stuck on geometry too little too much
- some arena design is so limitng for your awareness to enemies or for your movement I wonder how they managed to slip into the game
- level design sometimes could be a little confusing without a map, this guys should learn a thing or two from Valve
- power-ups look so unremarkable you can often easily miss them as they blend in with surroundings
- pinkies can soak a little too much damage
- cacodemon placement too often happens right on top of your head
- after a cyberdemon boss it basically a walk between two other bosses. I don't know why they crammed three bosses in such a short period of time

Fully charged gauss is your friend, on normal it one shots: hell knights - head, cacodemons - eye, pinkies - maw (I guess) and probaly something else I couldn't bother to test
---------------------
Тут должно быть ""Нормально, но"", однако, обзоры Стима такие же двойственные как концепция Рая и Ада.
Принудил себя закончить, чтобы выразить мнение. По скидке однозначно можно брать.
Что не так?
- для шутера с аренами слишком часто застреваешь в геометрии уровня
- дизайн некоторых арен настолько ограничивает отслеживаемость врагов или простор для движений, что удивительно, как они попали в игру
- без карты дизайн уровней порой запутан, им стоит поучиться кое-чему у Вальв в этом плане
- усиления выглядят так невыразительно, что их порой не замечаешь на фоне окружения
- пинки могут принять слишком много урона
- какодемоны часто размещены так, что падают практически тебе на голову
- после босса кибердемона ты по сути прогуливаешься между двумя другими боссами. Не знаю, зачем они впихнули трёх боссов в такой короткий промежуток времени.

Заряженный до конца выстрел гаусса твой друг, на нормальном он ваншотит: хеллнайтов - в голову, какодемонов - в глаз, пинки - в пасть (я так думаю) и вероятно еще кого-нибудь, но мне было неинтересно проверять."
"Overall, the game is meh, so I wouldn't recommend against it, but it is plagued with infuriating stuff that makes me wonder what the hell happened in the dev team and who came up with those designs.

-The game is too easy, even on ""nightmare"", and...
-Will not let you play on the highest level of difficulty on the first run, obviously
-The progression system on the last level of weapon mods and runes makes you play in absurd ways to unlock them
-The story is uninteresting at worst, silly at best
-The game won't let you save your progress, which wouldn't be such a big problem if the next point wasn't a thing
-The game forbids you from backtracking sometimes with locked doors and will not warn you when it happens, forcing you to restart the level if you want to find remaining secrets
-Glory kills are annoying after the first one and stop the flow of the game, yet...
-Glory kills are mandatory for some challenges, and...
-Some glory kill challenges require you to perform a specific one on a specific part of the body of monsters with a specific orientation, distance, and timing, 5 times on the level
-Glory kills do not provide any invulnerability frames after you perform them, so sometimes you just die after doing one
-You can accidentally restart the level and lose all your progress after you die (annoying glory kill challenges included)
-Did I mention glory kills is a terrible mechanic?
-That's just me, but I don't like metal and electric guitars and it makes my ears somehow cringe

If that doesn't stop you from wanting to play the game, you'll probably enjoy it, it is kind of DOOM after all. However, you could also try out old DOOM-like games instead."
"Classic Doom: Doomguy is fast as hell, he even circle-strafes slow monsters and shoots them before they react.
This Doom: Monsters are fast as hell, they even climb on walls, and run around doomguy to shoot in the back before he reacts.

Classic Doom: Vivid color pallete of surrounding gives more contrast to blood and gore.
This Doom: Everyting is colored red and yellow, so that blood is less noticable and it's more appropriate for all ages.

Classic Doom: OST with melodies from speed and heavy metal of 80's and 90's, give more edge to the experience.
This Doom: Yeah, brutal and powerful riffs, but the soundtrack is even more slow than the doomguy. And soometime it sounds like a Mochael Bay movie.

The game is okay-ish, but still I prefer ol' cup of classic."
"warning for unfixable glitch that breas coding in controllers as well as locks your mouse to the screen
good game if it was funcunal... disapointed more than anything"
"Good day reader

I would like to start off with saying that this game took me 0,7 hours to beat. Therefore this is a waste of your money.

Rating: Easy / 10"
It poopoo bad
"Bored to death. 
Uninstalled after less than 1h. Advance, shoot, advance, shoot. I know doomer don't care much for a story, but they could have provided a bit of background to try to make it worth to play. Only good point is that it runs smoothly on a quite old computer. 
Too bad I can't ask for a refund."
bad game. doom 3 better
"Can't jump far enough. Got the boots, looked up user advise, still got hung up in 2 different places where I could not jump far enough. Some bug in the program"
"It gets really boring, there's only so long you can shoot demons until it wears off"
"The shooter for the console babies. You can't save. Because consoles can't save. You're doomed to check points that kick in every now and then. Bethesda - as incompetent as they always are - think that suspension is maintained by hiding the checkpoints. They are wrong as they always are. It doesn't help, really. ID Software is a pale ghost of its former glory - all the people who made magic in the 1990s are long gone and the people remaining are brainless corporate drones.

And that shows in the game. It's Call of Honour: Medal of Gears: Console Shooter for brain dead customers who never played Painkiller and this might think that shooting waves of enemies while being locked into a room or few rooms is ""unique"" gameplay.

This is not a DOOM game despite what some ""journalists"" or Youtubers claim. This is a brain-dead console shooter that is identical to Call of Duty or Medal of Honor, they just changed the textures to make it look different. And they didn't even bother to do that properly. Textures are poorly laid out, meshes break into the environment. It's appalling and honestly, insane, that a game made in 2016 cannot keep up with a game made in 1993. That's how badly Bethesda is screwing their customers.

Google Brutal Doom and play the  original again. You'll have more fun than in this extremely limited arena shooter that fails even to pump up the adrenaline."
"its fun, but play eternal."
"Just mediocre. Half the enemies looked like they belonged in Quake which was meh, despite the rest looking very well done. Only additions I cared for were the secondary weapon fire of several guns, everything else was standard. 

Primary reasons it gets a negative is I fell through the plane of existence (glitch) too many times and got snagged way too often on door ways and stair wells. Literally full stops in mid combat resulting in death. Just some funky collision going on with the player and the ground in common areas and it's extremely noticeable. And of course hype. It's average. It's worth playing but it's average and everyone and their dog are acting like it's the greatest thing to ever sweep past their faces. Visually sure, it gets the props (Minus the quake ripoffs and the horrible redesign on the Imp), and some unique choices in gun fire, but literally everything else about this game was average. Grabbing ledges felt more overdue than a nicely implemented mechanic which I was really hoping would be some intense parkour mechanics. At least the ability to slide under things. something else. Just meh. Worth playing? Sure, but it's pretty standard as far as an FPS experience goes."
"bs, this game is full of glitches, fall through platforms, randomly die when there are no enemies around, get stuck in areas if you die because you need a key card or something and once u get it once it dosnt come back if you die. wish i could get my 34.99 back."
Keeps on telling me fatal error. Only for this game no other ones. dissapointing
This game is a pain in the ass. It's a shooter on a mission. But they give you terrible clues that take forever. Plan on wasting a lot of time while having fun in brief spurts.
boring
Not as good as Brutal Doom
"Quake 2 is the ketchup on spaghetti, great game, makes me happy.

Doom 2016 is just pasta. No ketchup, no meat. Raw pasta. Pasta made for console players.

Yeah yeah yeah, Quake is not Doom, but I don't like the game. 

Quake 2 is like sex while Doom 2016 is like masturbation."
crashes for literally no reason. bethesda seal of approval
"I just don't get it.  How does this game get this many positive reviews?  I guess I am not a student anymore and have matured past games like this.  Far Cry, Crysis, F.E.A.R., Call of Duty, I found them so much more enjoyable and at least a little tactical and thought provoking.  Lucky, I only paid 6 bucks for this."
Not much to say just seemed to arcadey like.
the game is good NO IT FUCKING ISNT I FUCKED MYSELF IT IS FUN BUT NOW IT WONT EVEN FUCKING LAUNCH AND FOR 20e I WAS EXPECTING MORE.so this game is a fucking money grab and if it works on other pc why cant it owrk on my fucking pc why can i not enjoy this game what have i dont to deserve this + WHEN IT FUCKING LAUNCHES IT GETS FUCKING CORRUPTED WHEN U REACH THE EXITING PART AND FUCK ALL THAT THINK THIS IS A MASTERPIUECE BECAUSE IT IS AN UNFINISHED AND UNPOLISHED PIECE OF FUCKING HORSE CUM AND U CANT DO NOTHING ABOUT IT AND IT ONLY WORKS ON INTEL SO IF U HAVE AMD U BETER STICK 20e UP UR ASS AND RUN AROUND THE STREET SCREMING FUCK TOD HUARD AT LEAST IT CANT GET CORRUPTED BUT U CAN GET ARRESTED WHICH IS WAY FUCKING BETER THAN GETTING A FILE CORRUPTED EVERYTIME U LEAVE THE FUCKING GAME AND ID RATHER GET A DICK UP MA ASS THAN PLAY THROUGH THIS GODDAMN GAME AGAIN SO IF U WANT IT GO FUCK URSLEF WITH TOD FUCKING HUARD AND THAT CUNT FROM ID SOFTWARE AND GO PLAY SKYRIM A GAME THAT DOESNT GET CORRUPTED OR WOLFENSTEIN THAT WORK ON AMD TOO LIKE I CANT FUCKING BELIEVE IT IT FUCKING WORKS ON AMD AND WHY CANT THE CUNTS MAKE THIS GAME WORK ON AMD TOO WHEN THEY USE THE SAME MOTHERFUCKING ENGINE FOR 11 YEARS NOW ITS FUCKING OLDER THAN MOST FORTNITE KIDS AND SPEAKING OF FORTNITE FORTNITE DOESNT GET CORRUPTED SO IF U DONT WANT UR SAVEFILES TO BE THE ROMANIAN GOVERMENT PLAY FORTINE BETER THAT THIS GAME AND IM SICK OF THE GODDAMN TODHUARD FANBOYS INFEDSTING THIS GODDAMN COMUNITY WHO JUST WANT HS DIK DEEP INSIDE THEIR GODAMN ANUS AND IM NEVER ISTALING THIS AGAING AND U CANN AL DIE IN SYRIA U FUCKING CUNTS AND IM GONNA BREAK UR FUCKING LEGS
Not a bad game. I just bought it to drool over the graphics. Same thing over and over. Gets boring after 20 mins.
666/10
It was fun at first then it got repetitive and boring
"Great game when I played it a couple years back, but now it launches to a black screen.  I tried several possible fixes: updating graphics card drivers (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 on Windows 10), verifying cache integrity, reinstalling, etc.

Will update this review when a solution is found."
"With a few good hours in, I can say so far this has felt kinda meh if I'm being honest. Combat's eh, demon designs are kinda cool, and the soundtrack is just there. If you like to be on the move, inserting your fist in the skulls of demons and an okay industrial metal OST, go for it."
"Not really my type of game. Don't get me wrong, the game feels nice and smooth but it is too linear. You feel trapped in little zones"
Meh
"If you have accessibility issues this game is not for you. I really wanted to like it and am a huge fan of the old Doom games so i genuinely feel crap for not being able to play this. The color blind mode literally just makes everything green, and there aren't anyways I've been able to find that makes things more visible and easier to see. The audio is not that great. The soundtrack is awesome though. Also if you use a bluetooth headset good luck getting it to work with this game. So again not recommended if your use case is mainstream."
Crashes on startup. Beware before buying.
Nu Doom Bad
"meh, prefer painkiller hell and damnation. Perhaps Arcade mode, story though? suuuuucks"
it does not work at all
"all ids games are having the same issue of telling you to buy it again until I can play this game without having to buy it again I cant recommend any ids game

ps I think it has something to do with quakecon"
"I understand that its a different type of shooter but i just cant play this game for more than 20 minutes before things start feeling like chores. Its just constant running and jumping around and getting glory kills to get more health and ammo. That's how it starts, thats what it is. 6/10"
"Dog shit game, capped at 200 FPS because of broken physics, plays more like a platformer than a shooter and doesn't get the point of a proper boomer shooter from id. Worst of all, other games rip off the bad ideas from this one."
"The gameplay is awesome. what is not awesome is after achieving mastery of all weapon add ons, having my save reverted to one that is 9 days old, losing all that progress..."
Shit
"Just meh...
Maybe I am too old to buy some SILLY STORY about demonic worshiping and invasion.
Maybe I am too old to enjoy NO TENSION (you just kinda play it through like Battlefield single player) at all where the only danger of scare comes from frustration of not being able to hit at something that is hitting you (super annoying ""gimmick"" to make it harder by glitches than by smart AI).
Maybe I am too old to understand why one can carry a chainsaw, 4 guns but only 3-4 clips of ammo.
Maybe I am too old to appriciate that there is NOT A SINGLE FLASHLIGHT on the whole planet.
Maybe I am too old to FIGHT ALONE over and over and over again (some games cope with teaming).

All in all very disappointed, would not recommend buying it even for 6 euros."
"Quit gaming 8 months ago. Bought a new car, I have an amazing new girlfriend, I make a shitload of money and I'm buying a house this spring. I party every weekend, I'm never home. I'm enjoying life. Do yourselves a favor. Stop trying to make gaming a career. It's cringe as fuck"
"You will lose your progress if you are not careful since the automatic save system is broken.
EPIC FAIL for a multi million dollar game.
I won't buy Doom Ethernal until I'm 110% sure the saving systems works fine.
Don't you worry about contacting Bethesda you won't hear from them back."
At this day and age it just feels like its not enough.
Really boring... dont buy it.
"Game is OK, nice product, but after the first few hours... you've already seen the whole game... gets old pretty fast and over stays its welcome... the grind was real
also story is meh... final scene showed a dude that i dont remember seeing before at all... wtf...
If you love Doom... maybe this game is for you... otherwise just play a demo and skip this
not getting eternal for sure"
For an action game is sure is linear and boring
"I went into this one with much excitement.  Indeed, it has some great action set pieces along with frenetic action and a great soundtrack.  Unfortunately what ruined it for me was the fact that between the action set pieces, it becomes a big puzzle as to where to go next on the map and this pulled me right out of the game.  In frustration, I had to consult YouTube walkthroughs several times to figure out where to go next and how exactly to get there.  I also found the overall difficulty to be a bit high and the checkpoint save system didn't help matters either.  In the end, I gave up on this one after playing just under five hours (most of that trying to figure out where to go next) and really have no desire to go back to it.  Uninstalled.  This was the only time that I ever asked for a refund on a game on Steam, which was denied because I played for more than two hours.  Will definitely be skipping on Doom Eternal."
"Very very weak design. Levels are repetitive, monsters are repetitive. The boss fights are not fulfilling - kill the first incarnation of the boss, then you get a second version you have to fight Wow - very original design. Bosses have the typical behavior of knock them down to 50% health and they introduce a 'new' attack. Except it looks like every attack in every other platformer since 1985.  

The levels all feel the same with areas you can jump to and climb up on, with the added bonus you get hung up on 'features'.

Go exploring, look I found some armor and health only to have monsters spawn in on the way out and you lose all the armor and some health so you're in worse shape. Very creative.

The constant monster spawns get tiresome and of course the battle escalates and so you can plan on having more powerful monsters spawn in at the end of the battle. 

The worst mechanic is the chainsaw - fuel is scarce so you don't get to use it much. 

The Titan fight was really bad - bosses that flip and roll around? This is Doom, not some PS4 anime knockoff game. 

Did the designers play the original Doom, because I did, and this doesn't feel like it. It's another generic FPS. It's going on 30 years later and this is the best 'game design' they can come up with?"
"I mean it's a title reboot, there's nothing new here. Grab this for extremely cheap - as it is worth at least one playthrough."
It plays like a bad quake game. Truly the Mad Max: Fury Road of video games in the worst way possible.
Crashes most of the time... Settings are minimized... and can't even play anyway since it crashes at loading screen..
"There is no satisfaction in pressing G to make demon explode. Predictable arenas with spawning enemies like a 90's JRPG overworld. Yawn.

I appreciate the lore and worldbuilding and design, but everything about the game says ""go as fast as possible"" and it makes me feel like I'm missing out if I stop and take my time.

After trying to play through this twice, I think it's just not for me."
"I started playing in nightmare difficult and at first it felt ok, dying several times but then i got the pattern and the game turned into. ""Shoot at their feets, then glory kill, climb a wall, shoot at their feets then glory kill...goto 0"" Game turned into a sleepwalk, completed stage 1 and had enough.

A game shouldn't require me trying to convince myself that i had fun, didn't felt like the difficult was increasing, once i got to lvl 2 it was just a spamm of useless zombies and more of the same monster, dunno if the entire game is slow like this but i was expecting some fast phased madness. Even quake 2 felt better than this.

I think they just wanted to make the game some sort of cinematic or whatever with some background story nobody asked and a bounch of coward demons that spends more time climbing and jumping away from fight than actually doing something, just disable music and play this on background and it feels more apropiate

Had more fun in wolfestein 1 than this but at least i bought it on some big sale."
"Saai spel, kut mechanics"
Please no more
Fucking boring
"The only selling point of this game is the ""feel"" (physics, weight, umph) of the guns. If firing them for 10 hours straight while running in circles is enough to entertain you, Doom 2016 might be the right fit for you.

For gamers who want interesting level layouts or anything besides dime-a-dozen arena shootouts, hard pass. Don't spend money on this. Everything looks cool, but that's a facade; the core game isn't nearly as engaging as it wants you to believe it is. When you're close to death, it's stressful, and when you're far from death, it's boring. At its best, it's mind-numbingly hypnotizing. At its worst, it's a regression of the very genre it hoped to reinvigorate. Seriously, the final mission is a cliche, painful gauntlet level with a ""deactivate the three generic things"" structure. Yawn. If that doesn't say it all, nothing does.
  
Edit: Multiplayer is fun, though, when you can find matches."
"I'm about 1/3 through the game and its not bad. Played other games that are better but for a non-open world game style, i would have given it around 6/10. 
The hard to reach/find collector toys i can understand putting in strange places but as the game progresses they tend to be found in places that are designed to hide them intentionally. 2/10
Then we find some runes. These seem to be interesting but quickly find that these wont really be anything worth useful until the game is nearly completed. 3/10
Then to get the runes themselves the Dev's thought it would be hilarious to put a 5sec or less time table. Ok, i can see that but killing stuff doesn't allow for stacked time. you kill 5 things in 3 secs, your time gets reset back to 5 sec. 1/10
Then they give you the slowest reload time in a gun compounding the issue. 1/10
To make things worse, they slow down time/environment at 1 second. If you're jumping, you wont make the jump, if your trying to (quickly) reload, you're not going to make it. 1/10
After replaying the same map for 8+ times, and you're near the end, screen goes full orange. prompt tells you lost internet (i'm hardlined by the way) and that whole 15 min or so of cursing at the screen, ya you get to do it all over again. -50/10
DON""T FORCE GAMERS TO BE ON THE INTERNET ALL THE TIME!! -100/10
Update:
Its the gift that keeps on giving.
Near the end of a map, won't spoil the fun in telling you which one, you are greeted with an 'old friend'. Buyer beware, this is a one way trip even though the Dev's tease you with a FAKE elevator that would appear as if you could go back up and collect the missing toy collectible you missed. Some coder could have spent another 30 min of coding to make this happen. Only way to go back to collect retarded toy is to replay the enter level! And Dev's want me to pay for their next doom game... hahahahahahahahaha"
"game is fun and i would love to recommend it, however my save was corrupted twice on the last level after 20 hours of collecting and upgrading two times. this is a known bug and the devs have done nothing to fix it in four years."
"In general the game is great. Good story, excellent gameplay and overall good experience. My biggest concern, is that right now there is a bug on the FPS cap. I have a 144hz monitor and the game is stacked in 60 fps. No matter what I have tried so far (turn v-sync off, switch borderless to fullscreen, change engine, anything I have seen on forums). I don't get it how such a game developed by such studios still has this bug and I cannot find a solution. 
I will update it once I find a fix.

(P.S. I have Ryzen 2600x and radeon rx580)


Edit - 08/04/2020:

Somehow - don't really know how, I no longer have the fps cap issue, but since yesterday - I CANNOT load the story campain. I press continue, the game loads, and then it returns me in the menu. I tried format, re-install, changed drivers and Graphics API, nothing works.
Seriously the game is very fun to play and I want to play more but seriously at this point, I just can't. 
Such a pity."
"Save game corruption after getting through 80% of the game. Steam cloud backup for some reason is a save around 50% of the way. Tried loading external saves but keep getting corruptions messages. Really annoyed, seems tons of people had issues similar to this, no way I'm getting doom eternal after this garbage."
bethesda sucks massive wang
"Absolute garbage. Visually it looks good, which is expected of a modern AAA game. The rest of the game? Well this is all there is to it. Do you see an enemy? If so, shoot until 10000 nit yellow light emits from their body. Then walk up, press F, and watched the same canned animation you've seen thousands of times by the first hour. That is the only way to actually play the game. Gone are the days of shooting your enemies to death. Now you just rip a limb off them and beat them with it in a boring animation. If you don't press F on the enemies, you suffer as you will get less health boosts, ammunition, armor, etc. The game even grants you invulnerability during the canned animations! Low on health? Press F and then reap the benefits. Anyone who likes this game has never played the originals."
"This is bulshit, iv bought the game iv played like 84 min and we cant play it anylonger since you freaks moved it out from GFN"
COOM
meh
"Honestly? Not enough diversity. Very repetitive. 

I shouldn't expect much from a Doom game, where the sole premise is to shoot a bunch of hell demons with awesome weapons while techno-metal plays in the background. And I was still disappointed. As you can see, I put 14 hours into the game and finished it. It was not entertaining. I regret buying this even on sale. 

At least I learned a lesson about hype."
I played it and was kinda bored after an hour. Maybe one day I'll redownload and play the game but for now I just don't see what the hype was about.
"The game is sooo bo-o-oring. I played it two years back and couldn't finish. Now Eternal released and I wanted to recall why I haven't finished  this Doom. Now I understood.
The levels, the actions everything you do is so similar all the time there is absolutely no diversity. Jump up the cliff, jump down the cliff defeat monsters, go to next cliff. That's all. Story is boring it is absolutely not engaging. Equipment upgrades are not interesting. Those challenges everywhere. Challenge to get this, challenge to get that, too many challenges.
Most awful soundtrack I ever heard. 
The only thing I must admit - is a great optimization.
Played two hours today and deleting again. I think I need to put a mark somewhere - do not play in this again.
Of course there is no talk about buying Eternal. This Doom franchise is over for me."
The definition of trying too hard. Do people actually think this kind of thing is cool?
maaaaan i love satan
"Nothing like the old Doom games. 
It's literally a press [b]A for Awesome[/b] type of a QTE game. 

I don't recommend this game."
VERY REPETITIVE
"I know others arent as challenged as i am doing jumps. It seems like this is all its all about. i will probably play the game up to the betrayer if i can get to him again. If not, because of the constant jumping, i will most likely not play this game, and i will uninstall the game. Its my fault i cant jump, but this is too frustrating for me."
"Even in Hell there are Funkos. Especially in Hell? Anyway, this is appropriately banal for a game that imagines a dimension of Eternal Torment to look like Castle Greyskull on a wet Wednesday. Riffing off a game from 1993, it's a remarkable achievement from id that the gameplay is even more simplistic than what would be acceptable 27 years ago - walk into a room, the doors lock, you have to kill a repetitive roster of extraordinarily stupid enemies (in increasingly annoying numbers), the doors unlock, you walk into the next room, repeat, yawn. Sometimes there's a boss! We're spoiled. All this while some sub-NiN dirge farts along in the background like game devs have just discovered CD audio (ironically the Playstation Doom had way better ambience). The story...well who cares about the story? Not the writers certainly, copy/pasting various elements from every other FPS (""You have to stop the person doing the thing! Make sure you stop them doing the thing and don't arrive just a minute late so that they do it and the plot continues""). You can amass tokens to upgrade your gear, just like in every other FPS. There are save 'checkpoints' and laggy texture loading, just like in every other FPS (that has been optimised for console - how much did you pay for your 'battlestation', oh scion of the 'PC Master Race'?)

This is a lame, tedious, generic shooter that no-one would have given a toss about without the name. Given that only 30%-odd players have got the 'Knee Deep in the Dead' achievement for game completion I would suggest a lot of these glowing reviews are a noisy minority or weirdos trying to obsessively-compulsively level up their Steam account. Or worse, a portal to a dimension of Low Expectations has lazily yawned open and an infernal army of morbidly obese virgin gamers have waddled out, desperate to find commonality with other Mountain Dew-guzzling sexual inadequates by aggressively agreeing about sub-par shooters.

In summary, an appallingly dull game that has now put me off a) starting other games I was going to while away Coronaboredom with and b) modern gaming entirely. Does John Carmack not own enough Ferraris?

Rip (off)'n'Tedium (haha get it???????????)"
"I was there from the beginning of the genre this is just to say that I've played every ID software's major title to death All Dooms, ALL Quakes, Rage and many add-ons and modes to those games. DOOM 2016 I hate with passion. It`s a pity that ID Software was swallowed by Behtesda because we ended up with another attempt at Skyrim rather than a proper Doom game.
 I tried 3 times to try and like it but every time there was something different that just turned me away from it. This is my personal opinion - Bad soundtrack, Bad A.I. My Gawd the sound is so bad it`s just unbelievable. When monsters appear it`s like someone constantly is vomiting in your ear and there`s no telling from where enemies will pop up since this disgusting all consuming sound just overshadows everything. 7 times out of 10 I can`t even say what killed or where it came from for that matter. Bad Level design (lock downs which prevent you from exploring previous areas), Bad gunz sound,NO ATMOSPHERE. And you know what ? I think those little secrets with original Doom levels is just the developers trying to convince everyone how ""amazing"" that 2016 Doom is in comparison to the original. Just like them sayin' - ""Look and see for yourself how big of a progress we've made!"" Well yes and no - I just revisited Brutal Doom and believe it or not it has much more punch to it than this abomination of a game. 
 If you are a casual player without high expectations try and check it for yourself but if you consider yourself a connoisseur pass by you won't loose much.
* Update. As of 03/03/2023 I`m still unable to finish the game since it is so bad to my mind that I really have to force myself to play it (I`m hunting a particular achievement). I come back to Doom every once in a while but can`t endure more than half a level at one time.
 Now if I calm down and close my eyes and try to remember something memorable from Doom 2016 what do I see ? This stupid air bicycle taunt that's it. 
P.S. If you try to over pack the game with trivial features to please everyone the game consequently looses it's character. Just saw the release of Doom Eternal saw the same colour scheme I'm passin' this one too by."
Won't launch anymore. tried to reinstall and no luck. my game drive is not being picked up. installed on my main drive and still no luck.
"my pc shut down mid game and for some reason i now have no game progress and no hud when i tried to man up and try again fuck this piece of shit game fuck you for wasting my time and fuck you again for the sake of just fucking you, you piece of shit game, fuck you
i uninstalled and restarted the game.......i finally got up to where i left off, pc shut down randomly AGAIN!!! I LOST EVERYTHING A SECOND TIME THE CREATORS OF DOOM OWE ME HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK EEING AS THOUGH I SPENT THAT MUCH ON YOUR GAME FOR FUCKING NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK YOU SO FUCKING MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Still a lot of cheaters around - and this is why I am not going anywhere near Doom Eternal..

There are plenty of very good players.. 
However, you still get players that are running around at a much faster speed than everyone else ALL THE TIME. Some also have ridiculous movement in the air (A level above having Thrusters) and often kill you with one shot.. Others are lagging (deliberately) as they run around - making them almost impossible to hit.

You can tell a good player - and as mentioned, there are many of them.. The cheats are a level above and there are plenty of them..

If they still haven't dealt with Doom cheaters, they're hardly going to be any better for Eternal.. A Hard Pass from me.."
"I don't hate this game, but I think its the worst experience I've ever had. 0/10 DO NOT BUY"
"There are a lot of bugs unfortunately. I've died to so many bugs. UI for selecting praetor suit upgrades is also buggy, sometimes it selects upgrades my mouse cursor was nowhere near. I really doubt it's an issue with my pc too, running an i7-9700, 2070 super, 16gb 3000 ram. I feel like I've spent too much time trying to figure out a bug or find where a glitched out mob was for me to recommend as it's just frustrating and it happens nearly every level."
"You kinda have to entertain yourself in order to have fun. Very slow introduction to it's guns and mechanics. Just buy eternal, skip this one"
"Dogshit arcade mode, may be playing for 30 mins but if u clip on moving terrain you die and whole run is ended. 

As well, checkmarks are bugged in arcade mode and even somtimes in the campagain. One playthrough is more than enough the singleplayer is boring as shit. 

Arcade mode is the best but man is it BUGGY. Gameplay is fun. but most arcade levels are  brutally shit. 


sorry for spelling errors i cant be bothered."
my dad plays this game

"Doesn't launch at all and no way to contact support, I've tried all the fixes in the forums."
"Get it on Sale.

The only real reason for the negative Review is the Feature of Glory Kills Finisher. I expected fast paced Gameplay but anytime you can do a Glory Kill finisher why shouldnt you do it? So you do the Finisher but now your Gameplay Speed has come to a complete halt because that fancy Animation now has to completely play thru.
A Friend told me that you can get a Upgrade to decrease the Finisher time, but reaching that Point / skilling that Thing is still not a complete removal of Finishers.
Obviously you can just leave out the Finishers but now the Game becomes Bullet Sponges and low Ammo for you nonstop.

Good:
+Doom
+Music

Bad:
-Glory Kills Finisher"
"Unskippable 1 minute long title screen when the game starts, every time the game starts, and then game crashes and locks the whole PC. Completely unplayable."
its janky garbage from when it frist came out and even now
was loving the game until i got to the point where you get BFG and then my game crashed and would not let me on the save cried for a good 30 minutes
"I don't like shooters. I gave borderlands a try and ended up loving it so I thought I'd give this a try too since it goes on sale so often, but I didn't really grab me. Too bad because I've listened to the soundtrack and it's absolutely glorious."
"Heads up to any new players looking to pick this up since Eternal's release. Old bugs have returned with updates to this game
such as the good ol' black screen, so the game (mostly) works out of the box, but is iffy on whether it wants to actually give you video. Controller support also seem to be broken; I had to unplug/replug in the controller at every load screen for it to remember it was attached."
"great game but it has hidden features - when you play online on 4g, your weapons stop working at some point. When you switch to offline and play, progress, and switch back to online - your progress is puff, gone."
"Game crashed,  reboot, it just corrupted the saving files."
Where the fuck is toggle charge weapon?
"I've played DOOM multiple times, and I wish I could give a neutral / mixed review on Steam.
Compared to Doom 64, Final, Doom 3, and Doom 2016; I have played Doom I and II the most out of the three.

Let me explain what I do like about DOOM 2016:
- I love the controls. Running around is smooth and aiming is pleasurable being able to trace my cursor on enemies.
- The demons designs are spot on and love the details on the models. Great work on designing all the enemies.
- The graphics and atmosphere is good and makes me feel like I'm in the UAC, Mars, and Hell.

Minor issues I've had with DOOM 2016:
- The sounds on the weapons could use more 'umph' to them. More heavy, make them sound more powerful. Think of when id 'nerf' the thompson machinegun in RTCW by just lowering the sound.
- Gameplay is just okay. The shooting enemies with the guns provided feel kind of bullet spongy on harder difficulties. Would prefer enemies to change behaviors and more enemies to deal with than increasing the enemy's HP value.

Nitpicking:
- I'm just not personally into the music. I'm not into dubstep.
- Would like the final blow animations to be more like ripping and tearing of flesh and bone than ripping and tearing brittle paper. Sound overhaul might help with that as well.

Largest issue I have with DOOM 2016:
- The pacing. Unlike Doom I and II you can go room to room freely, pick up items, and kill demons on the way. You can choose to go back to the room you were in to find some items, go forward and kill some demons on the way,  or if you want from start to finish rush forward in a straight line, massacre demons on the way and rush to the exit.
(PS Doom I and II had an excellent manual that gave you the player some premise as to what is going on.)

In DOOM 2016 having to constantly be locked in a room, kill demons in an arena, demons respawn to where you have to kill them again, then finally having the room unlock to go to the next room to do it all over again can get very old. It breaks the pacing of the game restricting you from choosing how you want to pace your game.

I haven't played DOOM Eternal yet, but if the arena areas are limited to just a few to break the pacing in the game, that would be fine. Being in an arena every time throughout the game gets dull to me.

This is just my opinion of DOOM 2016. Like I've said I wish I could give a mixed / neutral review."
"Does feel like Doom. The guns are weak and the mosters too much a bulletspunge. 

Glorykills are fun, the first few times but afterwards they become a chore. But they look good in trailers and streams and that's all that matters. So it's a small sacrifice to [strike]criple[/strike] adjust the rest of the gameplay to facilitare them as much as possible.  Who in their right mind would play a First Person Shooter when they can play a First Person Brawler. We can only hope they will remove those annoying guns from the next Doom game.

Needs mods to be fun. https://www.moddb.com/mods/weapons-mod-for-doom-2016"
"So this game used to run flawlessly. At least it did at launch and a few months later. Then it mysteriously stopped running. I tried years later (now) and it always says to update your video driver. So I did that... Then reinstalled the runtimes it required... Nothing. Then clean install and nothing again. Then verify cache and, you guessed it! NOTHING. It says its driver related but it is clearly not driver related at all. some internal error was never corrected in the main programs code. I tried setting launch options to open GL and Vulkan and still nothing. I am fairly disappointed as this is the only game that has ever had this bad of an issue when it comes to just booting. I cannot recommend a game that has this big of an issue as its no longer playable. And yes, I tried it on multiple OSes. I verified the cache and rinse and repeated all the same steps. The devs decided to stop updating the game yet force it to be played with all the newest updates with no work around for that either. Meaning, the game is perma FK'ed! I am not sure if Bethesda is behind it as they have grown very lazy with many recent games, but it does stink of them. All other ID software games in the past still run like a champ."
"I just lost ALL the progression I made. Why? Because #bugs or #IdiotDevelopers
You s*ck, Id/Bethesda. You hear me? YOU S*CK!

https://steamcommunity.com/app/379720/discussions/0/357286119107723272/"
"I can't recommend this.

Previous Doom games allow you to save your progress any time without restriction. This game will only allow you to save at checkpoints.

So...something made 20 years ago has a better saving mechanic than something made in 2016. That is not progress, that's intentionally hindering a function."
SHITGAME
"KILLMOVE KILLMOVE KILLMOVE...
This game has nothing of the original Doom and tries too hard to introduce gameplay elements of newer games in it.
Its not doom anymore but instead a generic modern shooter."
"When the Doom Eternal came out I decided to try out this Doom and form my opinion about the new franchise. While the game is high quality, it has some questionable parts that you should consider before buying it. My first complaint about the game is its length. It is too short. I was able to complete the game in 7-8 hours. At the half-way of the game it became just repetition. New content does not appear quite often and because of that, when I was close to an end I was really bored and thought to myself: ""When is it going to end?"".
During game progression you will encounter several bosses. They are not particularly hard or have a lot of moves or special attacks or story that will make them interesting. So they are lame to me, because they just feel like mob enemies. 
From the gameplay perspective you will see all the game content before you reach half-way of the game. As I said before it just becomes repetition after that point. I hadn't had much fun due to that.
OSTs are great, sometimes during fights it synchronizes with the gameplay and it feels fantastic, but there are not enough of these moments.
Multiplayer part is not really bad. I would say it is good.
Overall, I am quite disappointed by the lack of content and what the game offers. Even though it has a lot of cool Easter eggs and some small contents, the game feels a bit lacking something. So in my opinion if you are interested in a good game progression with enough content to not make you feel bored, you shouldn't buy this game."
"The base gameplay is alright. The shooting is fun enough, and the very well-made animations never seem to become tiresome to watch.

Everything else wasn't done right. My biggest gripe is exploration: while the game starts strong in this regard, soon enough the level design becomes nothing more than a series of gauntlet rooms that are connected by one-way drops and doors, even though there is absolutely no reason why they need to be one-way. If you decide you want to go back and look for some secrets, you have to restart the entire level (and sit through all the unskippable cutscenes again!). It doesn't help that there are no manual saves, only checkpoints; and there are plenty of bottomless pits to fall into, so if you are the sort of person who prefers to explore every nook and cranny over using a guide, get ready to restart from some annoying checkpoints lots of times. Also, one of the collectibles uses a reference to the original game, so if you never played that, you are very unlikely to find it.

The challenges feel more like fetch quests than challenges. Annoying chores that discourage you to approach fights the way you'd want to. And on top of all that, most of the time you have to look at the game through a horrible looking piss filter. The original doom games used plenty of colours, including vibrant blues; in this one, you don't get anything other than gray and orange.

Don't pay full price for this."
"waste of money even on sale, ammo is impossible to find and system requirements are a lie. badly made in genral"
"Don't play this if this is your first DOOM game, I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this game even after buying it on sale. This game feels slow even though it was clearly made with the intent of being fast FPS with loads of action but it has too many load zones and too little demons to kill. The maps feel like mazes, I was focusing more on my map than killing everyone"
"Not my kind a game.
I tried this game 2 times and both times lost interest after meeting Olivia Pierce 
 ~ 2h ingame.

I feel like a big part of this game is searching for secret rooms that are kinda complicated to get into in order  to find keys that open doors which will allow you to progress the campaign....

50% of the time is shooting Monsters while the other 50% is trying to figure out ways to get to rooms that have keys for closed doors....

Just not what i want to spent my time on"
I can't get Doom to load it just crashes
"About 20 hours into it, the game becomes Donkey Kong.

Notice how so many positive reviewers from 2016 only have 15-20 hours in game in 2020?

Yeah.

Lots of fun and then you have this horrid bridge level where you jump from platform to platform like Donkey Kong.

It ruined the game for me at about 19 hours in. From reading the reviews from 2016, it looks like LOTS of reviewers quit at about the same place and after giving the game such a glowing review. Go figure.

Doom should be a demon stomping, bad-guy splattering type of game and Doom 2016 is all that, until it isn't. I'm in a level where there is nothing to shoot at, no demons to kill, only another long jump to another hand hold to another high place.

If I wanted a platformer I would buy a Nintendo and play Mario something.

This was a great game. I was having a blast. I ripped a boss demon apart with my bare hands and then... Donkey Kong.

If there is a mod to skip this level, it might make the game playable to the end. As it is, 19 hours in and dustbin."
Too little for the price.
"Horribly coded. Refused to start after adding a new monitor, save games frequently corrupted."
Very mid.
"I shouldn't have to spend hours hunting for solutions online to make a game launch. Still can't find a solution that works, can't play it. Not buying anything from ID again. at least I only wasted 2 dollars on this."
"The only thing good in this game is optimization I can run it 165+fps maxed out 1440p with 980ti i7 5930k and 32gb 2666mhz ram story and everything else meh

Since I can't review Doom Eternal gonna post it here don't buy it if you liked the first game the second one feels like a downgrade FPS is worse and graphics ain't better at all thank good I didn't buy it"
"The game's great. But for me, it was no inclusion of toggle between running and walking. Due to the running always on, you can't admire the atmosphere and could get lost easily. That's right this is a kind of game where you ask yourself ""where the heck do I go"" a lot. Adding toggle for walking can easily solve the disorienting problem that you get a lot while playing."
"we aware there are progress reset glitches still in this game even now in 2020, not going to play a game that just reset my progress."
"Will not launch saved game, level select, or even start a brand new campaign. Reinstalling 60gb of game data hasnt worked either and just results in the same thing... loops you back to the main screen where it advertises the new doom ultimate...

i guess iD and Bethesda will break your old game unless you buy the new shit... f that"
"Bugs on the second half of the game are actually innumerable. Mission near the end was bugged for me so I had to restart. Game is good obviously, people love it, but the bugs are actually extremely annoying. Specifically the bug that launches you around areas when interacting with terrain. It just did not stop happening to me and would cause so many deaths. Getting stuck on terrain in the middle of fights, really ridiculous. Honestly saw no reviews with this problem but it happened to me so just putting it out there. No one will care though. 

TLDR; Bugs in the second half of the game for me were insane, double jump is really bugged, terrain clipping happens alot"
"i've made a lot of progress on this game, found all of the easter eggs and secrets and the game restarted my game. didn't save or auto saved after getting all those stuffs! i don't want to restart and get all those secrets"
"Game crashed after a few hours of play and permanently corrupted my save file. There is no backup save, and I am unable to recover it. This has been a known issue since the game's launch and they haven't fixed it. Unacceptable quality from a ""AAA"" studio. I will never buy another ID game again."
"I normally don't at all enjoy serious-faced, gory, mid-octane, and all around intensely violent shooters, so it's rather a surprise that this one has won me over. But the controls are excellent, the combat is satisfying and presents a reasonable challenge, and it feels good to play, fail, and overcome. Even the highest difficulty feels satisfying and kind of fair, despite a permadeath mechanic that I don't personally enjoy.

There's also some incentive to explore if you like to, and that element is well done too, but Doom got me hooked more on the action.

The use of christian symbolism and allegory, though not particularly deep, can also be fun to think or talk about if you don't take it seriously (or if you enjoy taking it too seriously).



Why thumbs down? Bethesda doesn't deserve your money."
it dont start up
"I Reminiscing the days where I had to go through multiple chapters to complete the game.  I only was a cheap kid and played the demo.  This game I completed it and paid 60$ for the demo.  What is the game like?  Quake 3 Arena with a Doom Theme.  They put you in different areas, it turns into a cooperative deathmatch where its all of them against you.  No, that's not necessarily a bad idea.  My gut was tight in each match. 

It was enjoyable, but eventually the maps became bland, enemies were the same, the last boss was the boss from the first doom.  In the end all they did was added how many they could add to the map at once without it becoming too much.  Now Doom Eternal enters in as the second Chapter (see what I did there?) and they are demanding another bit.  Only less than 30% of players completed this game... 30.  Don't try to say it was a great game when only 1/3 of you completed the game.

Hate it or like this review. Facts are facts.  If you buy this you have a 30% chance of completing this game as other games are entertaining."
"After Doom 3, the atmosphere was so severely disappointing that I didn't make it more than a few minutes in. It was nothing like what I'd hoped it might be, no horror element at all - just a point and click shooter."
Kinda fucking boring after a while
"my save got corrupted 2 times not letting me finish the game after beating 3/4 of it, fuck this. also, thanks a lot for not fixing a bug that's 4 years old that resets your skill points and collectibles progress"
runs bad. might be just my system but not a good experience in that regard. other than that awesome game
"This game is such a shitty mess. Bethesa fix your fucking buggs, i cant even start doom twice without it crashing. What a shitshow, fuck you."
"MY SAVE DATA GONE!!!!!!!!!!!
HOW?"
"Literally unplayable at this moment. It's fun when it plays, but lately it changes all of my screens resolutions on start up, and will change it's own screen assignment and resolution as I'm in windows trying to fix the resolution problems it caused, WITHOUT ME EVEN TOUCHING THE PROGRAM! It doesn't matter what the configuration files say, it will always start at 640x480 on my SECONDARY monitor. That's not even the main problem. The main problem starts when I start trying to fix it. I change it back and put it on the primary monitor and set my resolution back to 1920x1080 (using its poorly placed settings menu... I mean seriously, it's not even in the main menu. I have to go to campaign, then my save file, THEN settings to get to settings.) then my secondary screen is still stuck at 640x480. Okay, fine. I alt+tab and go to windows display settings and set my secondary monitor to 1920x1080... or at least I try to. Now the second monitor is fine, but my third monitor is now at 640x480 and Doom has switched to it as its display monitor... and that monitor is in portrait mode. Windows is also freaking out and slowing down every time a change is made.

Eventually after enough monitor musical chairs, I have everything set up how it should be. Problem solved right? WRONG!

Now when I actually attempt to play the game, every time there is anything like action, I get massive amounts of ghosting on my screen. It looks like it's trying to display the same frame twice over except the second one is 1/4 seconds late. No settings combination or presets seems to mitigate this at all. My frames are still reading normal, so it doesn't seem to be performance related, with having it on low settings with the issue persisting supporting that observation. I also don't want to restart the computer or the game because I don't want to play monitor/resolution guessing games anymore, which has happened every time I have started the game except the very first time.

I am honestly just probably going to uninstall the game, and because of this I have no interest in getting Doom Eternal. I mean, it looks like a lot of fun, but I'm not going to pay $60 for a game that might not work or when it does, makes my eyes bleed while puking from motion sickness.

So far the only Ripping and Tearing this game has had me doing much of is my own hair."
...
"Paid for, eventually downloaded, constant Fatal Errors, unusable. feel ripped off"
"THIS IS FUCKIN TRASH!!!!!!!!!! FOR A GAME THAT START ONLY AT 640x480 PIXELS RESOLUTION (NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO) YOU SHOULDVE AT LEAST LEFT THE OPTION TO CHANGE THE RESOLUTION WHEN WE LOG, BUT NO, THATS THE ONLY GAME WITHOUT BUTTON FOR OPTIONS!!! AND IT AUTOMATICALLY START AT 640X480!!! COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE GARBAGE LEFT BY THE DEVS!"
"It worked perfectly, when I lasty played it in 2018, wanted to play it again before buying doom eternal but its not working so im not gonna recommend this game to anyone. How do they ruin a game with updates?"
"This game is actually amazing, but DOOM Eternal blows it out of the water in every way. Play that instead, here's the link! 
https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/"
bad
cringey nostalgia bait rehash garbage
"The game is exceptional.
The thing i want to criticize is the execution.
I came back to the game during the lock-down and self-isolation. My save file is corrupt. Game loads when i press SPACE it boots me back to the main menu. ESC no longer lets me quit the game. So I sit trough 4 hour filechecking and nothing is detected to be wrong.
Starting a new campaign works.
Hope ETERNAL is better executed (pun intended)."
"Pros
- Good graphics and music
- Decent levels
- RPG-elements: choose some minor improvements to weapons and yourself

Cons
- No free saves; you died? Repeat the last 15mins for the 5th time!
- You die out of nowhere because once the scripted fights start you're surrouned by a hurricane of flesh and bullets and screams and some monsters one-hit you from afar
- Oh yeah, scripted fights. Enter room, doors close, enemies appear out of nowhere. Rince and repeat. Forever. Yaaaaaawn.
- ""Challenges"" require you to risk your life for some minor buffs or achievements; wouldnt be bad if you could SAVE YOUR GAME before getting started

The CONS are so severe and terrible that I'm stopping to play for the second time now and I dont think I will ever come back to finish this crap. Really sad."
"Optimization is the worst ever seen in a AAA game.
Always get 30-40% CPU usage and 40-60% GPU usage, causing heavy and frequent framedrops (30-40 FPS).

Using:
i7 8770K@4900MHz
Msi Seahawk RTX 2080
Both overclocked and stable in temperature"
"I had more fun playing Brutal Doom, this feels like quake arena + doom."
i wouldn´t recommend the game because of the bugs. every single time i die my screen will freeze for 15 minutes and then the game shut down. either that or i gotta shut down my computer cause i cant ac ces my home page.
"it's just not for me. I can't get into it. I've forced myself to play for 8 hours, and I'm gonna fuckin beat it, because I fuckin paid for it, but I just dont like it. It's not my thing."
TOO MUCH POLITICS!!!!!
this game is boring
The early game is some good fun but I really wish I dropped it about halfway through and never finished it.
"It started great, but I didn't like the mechanic of having to kill enemies from up close. Felt like there's only one way to play the game, and I didn't like it."
If you want to mindlessly kill things with minimal story then buy this game.
"I'm running Win 10. Every single time when I quit the game to desktop, the game crashes. every single time
it's 2020, please at least make it playable"
kil fdevil32
"if you like doing the same thing over and over, this is your game."
"I mean the graphics are sweet as they should be. But i'm just not impressed with the liner aspect of the game. I'm constantly dying because of jumping into invisible walls and falling to my death instead of just landing on a rock or platform. I see the demons jumping on all kinds of stuff. It's just not fun thinking you just kicked ass through a section of the game just to have 1 jump kill you because there was nothing in the way. Thus making you do the section again. All this game is teaching me is not to explore and run is a straight line down the giving path. unless the ultra liner aspect is changed is some way i cant recommend this game. Really the only reason i cant recommend the game. The enemies so far don't seem very intelligent, always shoot where you were so its easy to dodge most shoots if you stay moving. Just don't stop moving lol. If you like being shown the way and not exploring at all this is a good game still. Oh yeah the pistol is OP. haven't seen a point in using the shotgun tho just to clear with alt shot. I wish there was a neutral choice."
"IF YOU TRY TO EXPLORE THEIR LEVELS THEY CLOSE EVERYTHING OFF TO YOU MAKING YOU HAVE TO REPLAY THEIR GAME MULTIPLE TIMES JUST TO SEE THE LEVELS. NOT FUN GAMEPLAY, JUST A CHORE TO PLAY , AND YOU CANT EVEN EXPLORE. TERRIBLE. MADE BY IDIOTS."
"After defeated the last boss, I got a bug and could not finished him. He just lay on ground and rotate as I move and do nothing. I choosed restart mission and did not want to get throught whole level again and this just say, the game is not much fun for me. All game is just arenas with monster spawn, sometimes its super easy, sometimes its insane, unbalanced. Some monsters could survive massive amount of shots and this gives away the good feeling of slaugthering action, the killing animations get boring after a while. I would say this is a slightly below avarage FPS, but the last bug kills it for me."
"It's a boring game because its mindless, it's akin to a clicker with a metric ton of gore. Press melee when shiny the game."
Too much action and shooting and not enough mindless cutscenes and events.
"Great game, but honestly, you're better off on console. This game is a broken mess on PC. I have NO problems with other games, but everything from ID Software is a logistical nightmare to work with. If I go from my laptop screen to a TV or monitor plugged into it, it completely breaks the game and I have to delete the config file EVERY effing time I change what I'm playing on. And to this date, I cannot get the game to work on bluetooth headphones. Every other game and app works. Why not this one? Sorry that I can't give a proper review of the game itself. But every time I try to play it, I spend forever trying to get it to even work. Don't waste your time."
Eh

The game consistently gets stuck on 95% and never moves past the loading screen when I try to continue the game its incredibily frustrating and infuriating and I hate it.
too scary
"I don't know how but I got bored. It feels souless. Guns have no punch to them. Comparing to Rage 2 the shotgun in Rage 2 feels satisfying, you just want more enemies to shoot at. But in this game, you don't feel anything. I bought it for like 4 euros, so no big lose."
I'm sorry but you can't just do Mick Gordon dirty like that and get away with it especially Marty so until justice has been done this review will not change back to positive.
"""Let's bring it all back, proper""
""What, exactly?""
""The bad. Also, since original games were fairly good, let's come up with more bad of our own""
""Ok. What about the good?""
""No way.""

This is the dialogue that, judging from this game, went on in Bethesda's dev meeting. I'll give some points, why I think so:

* Entire game is basically arena after arena of respawning monsters and you can proceed ONLY if you've killed everything. Now, I really, really don't think this is good game design or anything enjoyable. Once you hear metal music pick up again, you know you're going to button mash for next 5 minutes. Ad nauseam. Every level has about 10-ish arenas with nothing of value inbetween. NO OLD DOOM GAME DID THIS, except for actual final boss fight. So forget about going your own way, Bethesda makes you kill every monster put into this game, period. Because it's so cool or something (it's not).

* Upgrade system that is unecessary and makes game feel rather limited and dumb. 20 shells for a shotgun, good luck! Again, original Doom games (1, 2, expansions) never tried to force a ""survival horror 2-bullets left"" thing on you. You ran out of ammo,  you could backtrack and pick up more, find secrets, and enemies dropped ammunition as well. Not here, except that...

* You're basically forced to use abysmal glory kill system or whatever sacrilege they did with chainsaw. Seeing those animations is cool for first few times, but force you to do those entire game to have any hope of proceeding, well, it's hard to cope with egoism put into this. Apparenly, ""our animations are so awesome that player will have no choice whether to use them, whatsoever, the main gameplay element is admiring how cool our animation artist was"". Christ.

* There is no exploration. Maps are horribly linear, have very little of alternate approaches, further hampered by terrible arena/locked door system and even secrets are usually at best, just nooks and crannies that open. Added to that, levels are farily boring, being basically sameish space station thingy and ""hell"" made of Disney dungeon assets that didn't make it into Skyrim.

* Enemies are bullet sponges, extremely quick, and have little feedback of either hurting you or getting hurt. So rather than being bloodthirsty space marine, you're circlestrafing while keeping one eye on health bar (because that's only way to know if it has depleted any, your character lacks any feedback) and other on horribly underpowered rocket launcher hitting nothing because even easiest enemies jump around like ninjas. Until ammunition runs out, because it sure will. For some reason, some weapons are supposed to be used sniper-like, aiming precisely from afar. That makes no sense whatsoever, because majority of enemies just charge your face.

Why play this game? With no sense of exploration or setting your own pace, non-enjoyable gunplay, horrible arena system and lackluster weaponry, what was point of this entire exercise? Yeah, it feels a bit like old games, but at no point ""as good as old games"". One should be really shooter-starved to consider playing Doom 2016."
boring
falling off shit you didnt realize was a cliff simulator
Very repetitive and overall boring. Not sure what people see in this game. It says glory kill. more like boring kill.
this game sucks shit too easy short as fuck final boss fight sucks full of shitty music and memes and doing 50 fatalities a second to get your health back from generic enemies that look like they belong in deep rock galactic overall F- rather play doom 2 and the new one will be the same shit fuck this game
"Good game, nice mechannichs. But is not my cup of tea. Very very focused in the intensity of the gameplay and the killing. And at some point you get bored. Also, I got lost many many times, the maps are confusing and annoying and make you circle back and stop agh, I just couldn't finish it"
"Although the game is fun, it is broken and at a certain mission I can't continue.  No more to say.  I am requesting a refund, hopefully they honor it due to the fact that I have supported steam, and refund requesting is not a normal thing I do.  In fact, this I believe is the first time I have requested a steam refund."
"I cannot recommend a game that suffers from unresolved technical issues like this. GTX 1060, 16 GB of RAM, Windows 10, everything up to date, the game stutters and freezes. The support is barely functional for this game.

Also Multiplayer doesn't work.

However, after getting a community kind-of-fix, I can say this is a great FPS. Really good package for SIngle-Player content.

If you see in a good sale, buy it. Otherwise, don't."
gets boring in half an hour. same 5 animations for plowing through enemies 1 by 1
"This game was great for the 12ish hours I have played it. But ever since a few months ago it will no longer start up and is completely unplayable. It constantly gets stuck while loading the title screen with the message: ""NOTICE Loading Title Storage"" and just stays like that with the menu music playing in the background.

Researched the issue and can barely find any more information other than this apparently happened to the bulk of players (on PC and console) around 2017 but was resolved. Everything I have tried to do to fix it (uninstall/reinstall, launch Steam in offline mode, delete game cache and settings, run commands, etc.) NOTHING has worked. This really pisses me off since I like the game so much and now I can't even play it."
"Everything about this game is amazing except while playing it, there were a lot of boring or obnoxious moments for me because of the design of the levels. The design of the levels require you to jump from platform to platform, very often in order to progress. And if you do not jump properly, you die and have to start from when the game last saved your progress. So in this game, you can't save when you want to save as well."
Broken Achievements
"I'll be really honest.  Although this is a well-made game it's just not quite my style and pace.  I loved things like Crysis and F.E.A.R. which are more tactical than this.  I like to sneak up on groups of enemies, scout their positions, learn their movements and then engage from a surprise attack, staying in control of the fight through position and tactical advantages.  DOOM is a frantic ""blast everything"" experience where enemy-spawning and placement of doorways means that enemies usually detect you before you detect them.

It's good but not really my thing.  I picked this game up at an absolute bargain-rate and I got very much what I expected.  But when it's cheaper than a cup of coffee ""why not give it a try"".

Update: I gave it another try recently, and got further with it but it's still just not my kind of game."
"To be fair to DOOM, it wasn't a game that looked like something I'd like. My favorite FPS is Unreal, and this looked like a FPS that lacked all the things that made Unreal such an amazing game. I only purchased DOOM because of the high ratings and recommendations, but it turned out exactly as bland as it looked. The arena-style combat just is not for me, and the environments are boring. The only cool thing is that you are this ultra badass, and roleplaying as him provided the only fun I had in my 5 hours of play."
"Feels too generic... Glad I picked this up on sale for super cheap. Plays fine, looks good, etc but nothing about it seems special in any way."
worst game i've ever played buggy glitchy mess i think i would rather kms than play this game for another second
"Save decided to corrupt 15 hours in, googled solutions and tried them all but couldn't recover. Other than corruption issue, it's reasonably fun but becomes repetitive pretty quickly."
if you want a fps shooter don't get this game if you want a platformer that seems so not work half the time and suck all the enjoyment out of it then this is a good choice
no
Level design.
"Very meh game, only 7 hours of gameplay while casually playing and 6 of those feel like the same thing over and over. Near the end i killed the final boss and didnt even realize since it felt just as repetative and boring as the other. If you can get it on sale for 5 bucks or free try it out."
Servers are dead. Didn't see that one coming..
"Not recommended,"
"overrated meme game, feels like someone looked at OG doom and thought to themselves, ""you know what made this game fun? well let's remove all of it, slow it the fuck down and add melee executions, because THAT is what doom is all about."""
"First off:  I played DOOM 1 and 2, I played Duke Nukem 3D, I played the Quake games.  I play a lot of games, and I've been playing them for about three decades.  I still play about a dozen hours of multiplayer shooters every week, in my 30's.  I remember the old games, I remember having fun with them.

If you take off the nostalgia goggles?  This one kinda sucks.  It's well polished, for what it is, but underneath, it's empty.  It's not the worst game I've ever played, but I'm VERY glad I only paid $6 for this mess, and skipped it when it was a new release.

TL;DR:  It feels like a high-res version of an old-ass game.  We've learned a lot about game design in 20+ years, but not here.

People talk about fluid combat, RIP AND TEAR, etc.  What they don't talk about, is that for every 30 seconds of ""intense"" combat (pick any gun and click for a few seconds while strafing) there's 5 minutes of wandering around, backtracking through each level, checking the awkward in-game map every now and then to look for ""secrets"" or even just to find your way to the next objective.  There's no ""cutscenes,"" but there's tons of forced stopping points to sit and listen to someone talk, or perform arbitrary actions (see, this one door doesn't open when you approach it, you have to press E, how exciting), despite Doom Guy's apparent attitude of ""FUCK YOU I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME.""  As a grown-ass man, a lot of the player character's behavior feels like watching a hormonal preteen throwing a temper tantrum, and it's more silly than ""bad ass.""

I don't know.  I could write more about all the specific failings, and go into more depth, but I guess I don't care enough.  DOOM 2016 is mostly just a very Generic shooter with a handful of fun-ish mechanics, crippled by indecisiveness on whether or not it should focus on action or puzzles, like some kind of awkward FPS-Metroidvania.  Wolfendoomtroidvania?  Who knows.

I think, also, I might just be too old for the BLOOD GUTS DEAD GUYS SAYTANIC RITUALS FIRE SKULLS aesthetics here.  I feel like the intended audience might be dudes who wear trenchcoats, collect katanas, think naruto-running looks cool, and probably need therapy.

You want a flowy shooter with great movement, tons of enemies, deep customization, and gameplay that's all-around actually interesting?  Go play Warframe.  You'll get so much more out of it, for free.  
You want something hard?  Play something competitive, like Siege.  If you got hard at my mention of trench coats and katanas and really wanna lean into that?  Go play... Postal 2?"
no
"It's a good game but we're back in 2004 with checkpoint saving and BAD CHECKPOINTS. Congratulations iD Software, it's a blast to the past with having to replay entire sections because somehow you're unable to add a quicksave and quickload to your game. Literal W.T.F."
Doom is a shooter that seems to take a lot of nods from a game with the same name released in 1993. I Guess that's okay but I'm not into the idea that it's a ripoff.
"I'm sure it's a great game, but the absolutely horrendous mouse lag I experience kind of ruins it for me."
"UPDATED my computer to play Modern Warfare (which runs great brw) and DOOM still runs at 13 FPS. WHAT A JOKE! Best optimized game of all time, 10/10. 

Brutal Doom is still WAY better. 

--Original Post--

Game just does not run on my computer at a decent frame rate for me. It should. Does sometimes. But over all it doesn't. Have tried everything. Here's what I've gathered so far. Its a good game but the hype is WAY overblown for me personally. Weapon upgrades, Doomtalities and level design are all just meh to me. The world is very nondescript and orange, and suffers from what Oblivion suffered from where ... its basically just bunch of rocks and spikes. I'm sure there are other facility levels later on but so far every area feels like a Canyon based deathmatch arena / jungle gym and its just not doing it for me. Where are the psuedo facilities that made Doom awesome? Doom to me is a game where you play a Badass out of luck, with no where to run, charging straight into hell because you'll probably die and there are no other options. You have little to no identity. In this game you're a creature who has already dominated his environment. You're there because you're supposed to be because you're the Doom guy and you're in Doom. An already established cliche inside his own environment. I'm not saying Doom ever had a great story line but it just feels weird and almost Duke Nukemish. Something about making things more and more .... high fidelity just takes it more and more away from the surreal comic book style vibe that made it what it was in the first place. Put the original wall and floor tiles up against the look and feel of this game and the original is way better. Far more creative. After Diablo, Event Horizon and God of War the hellish world we get here seems bland to me and I can't shake it. 

Is the game good? Yes. Will you love it? Probably. Should you listen to me? Absolutely not. Its just to me the overall style is once again being missed. I want a fast passed corridor shooter where I battle zombies and demons in biomech facilities and this game doesn't seem to provide that. Instead I just keep getting Oblivion style death match arenas. Far closer in style to Unreal Tournament or Quake 3 Arena with npcs than Doom. I think if Brutal Doom didn't exist and if people weren't constantly make mods and maps ect for it, maybe if I had been Doom starved for decades, maybe if I really liked the direction Quake took with deathmatch maybe I would like this game. To be clear it is a good game and people would probably like it even if it wasn't Doom by title. Hell tbh I like it and if it ran at decent frame rate I'd at least play it through once. Will I play it more than 10 times through and find myself downloading community maps and mods for it almost 30 years later? No, not even close. But hey, its the best, closest thing you're ever going to get. Yay Doom."
too many aimboters
"Shadow of a previous era, now a console delight, for all family to enjoy."
Maps are poorly finished.. most of my deaths are from being trapped against a wall or falling through the ground. game will also occasionally glitch and all weapons will stop working. I cannot recommend this game.
Questmarker.
ton of hackers one hacker in every game pass beginer piz fix
"the game is great. but it just freeze randomly. it took me me several hour to figure it out. just switch to vulkan and install vulkan driver. suck
why not you checking the program before the game was released?
win10 i5 9400 rtx2060"
"Wow. Why did I wait so long to play this? Very entertaining. Super quick run and gun style FPS. Very reminiscent of the original Doom like impossible difficulties and bad-ass demons, with what you would expect from a modern take; armor and weapon upgrade choices, good 3D map, fun melee kills. This is not the jumpscare garbage that was Doom3. This is true to Doom and Doom2 game style.

Edit: Changing my review. The non-skippable intro screen is supremely annoying when you have only a small window available to get a game in. The wait times for multiplayer are bullshit. You do not need to mapvote, and you certainly do not need a full minute to do so, then a 30 second buffer, then another 30 second character/weapon select, then ANOTHER 10 second ready once in the game. WHAT THE HELL? This isn't a damned battle royale, just get on with the deathmatch! Once a multiplayer game is over you can't actually LEAVE THE GAME until you watch the whole ""you win"" or ""you lose"" crap, and the top three players. SO MUCH WAITING for what is supposed to be a fast paced shooter game. Stop with this garbage. The auto-join sucks. Wish there was a pick your lobby like in the old Quake and Doom days. Let my escape key do it's job. Waiting in multiplayer is the worst and the intro screen sucks. End rant."
"Total garbage. The entire game is this stupid ""mechanic"" where you are on the verge of death, even at 100% health, and you have to melee enemies to get health back. The little health you have is gone instantly when enemies hit you, and you are being hit from enemies that spawn all around you. Try to aim and you die instantly. You circle strafe, left clicking and mash 'f"" (I think it was 'f'). Over and over and over. That is the game. Oh and get lost in the maze that the space marines decided it would be a good idea to build their base as.  You can carry barely any ammo, so you run out and have to pick up ammo boxes constantly.  Sweet 2008 graphics. Insane mouse acceleration. This ""game"" sucks."
"a mediocre shooter in general, a terrible episode in the doom series. shotgun is decent, though."
Have you READ the end user licence agreement?
servers shut down days after the sale. TRASH
"Campaign is decent but not very long approx 18 hours on nightmare
Multiplayer is fun but i cannot connect to the game anymore for some damn reason."
"Cant recommend since Bethesda just removed all their titles from GForce NOW, as a result people who payed their money for the game can't play it anymore."
walk to an arena. fight. walk to another arena. fight. gets old fast.
"Pulled out of Nvidia GeForce now service, lost access to all Bethesda products I bought exclusively to play on GeForce now since I don't own a gaming PC. Don't trust this company to protect it's customer over making that extra little bit of money. Thanks zenimax."
"Not really sure what makes this game overwhelmingly positive. Extremely boring FPS. Picked it up for $5.99 wouldn't say its worth much more.

Also, beat the game on normal in 12 hours. It's extremely short. I cant imagine paying retail price for something less than 20...the replay isn't that high either unless you like hard mode or finding collectibles."
"Save games always got corrupted, preventing a reload & forcing a restart.  Every. Single. Time.  Game also locked up/crashed a few times.  Basically it is unplayable."
"Cannot recommend this game despite the clearly positive reception, as the game will not start. Upon launch I am treated to a screen that says ""Notice: Loading Title Storage"" which is followed by an immediate crash or the game freezing entirely. I have yet to see the main menu, and no amount of googling has given me any information as to how to fix the problem."
"too much like an arcade game, and not enough strategy to be interesting."
"This was a big letdown for me. The graphics are great, but the pickups have a singularly console game type feel which breaks the immersion. It's a mindless shooter which should suit anyone who likes to just run and gun. I personally prefer the Fallout 4 types of RPG shooters which take a lot of thinking, broad tactics and management of inventory, with a rich levelling up system. I played about 3 levels of Doom and cannot see myself going back to it."
"No longer on Geforce Now, Bethesda is greedy for our money"
"Thing won't even load. Be a black screen for 15 seconds then crash. Even if you have a better graphics card than they specify, it still might crash. A lot of tutorials that allegedly fix the bug don't seem to be ""AMD friendly"". So if you have an AMD graphics card, please be careful when purchasing."
"Loved Doom ... until it didn't work.  10 hours after playing it   
 Stuck so I Googled solution after solution to no avail.  After all it was fun when it worked.   Maybe if I can get it working again I'll think about buying Doom Eternal.    But Bethesda is known in the community for having broken games and issues. So maybe not"
foundry level
Can’t turn up the brightness so I couldn’t see
"Devmode bug is still around. 2 chapters left and my save file is corrupt. 

There are workarounds but I'm not going to spend hours trying to find the solution. This bug has been around for a while and has received no inclination that it will be fixed.

Bethesda has turn into a dogshit company, fuck you bethesda."
Doom is supposed to be scary dark and creepy. This one is just ... dull!
"As like many others that I have read comments about.   The load times are terrible or it hangs and you have to completely restart the game...   It isn't my computer, checked all that."
"I have to be honest: it's not a bad game, I had fun playing it, but it's absolutely not a good DOOM game. If it had another name I'd have sure recommended it, but the name is carrying has a very big responsibility. This game basically become a meme of itself, the focus seems to be on exaggerate everything (the glory kills for example).
Let's start from the beginning: the first two DOOM games were masterpieces, they changed gaming forever. Now, I know the times are changing and mechanics and all have to evolve, but the original DOOM games are like a cool guy, this game is like a poser guy who tries to dress the same way and says ""hey look at me, I'm cool too!"".
Now the serious, technical part: the game is basically structured in ""rooms"", where you're locked in with all the monsters and the doors opens when you killed everyone. It was so much better in the original games where you have a level structure. 
The part that everyone seems to love, the glory kills, is just boring. After the first 50 demons you slay, it's not funny anymore to see a scripted animation of a demon face exploding, it just interrupts the pace of the game, that is already slow for an old style fps.
The game is pretty easy, I played it on ultra-violence and finished it without efforts. 
The multiplayer is very bad. It's very different from the single player, made by another company, and it's like a mix of halo and cod, where you're slow and can carry 2 weapons a time."
"It's a platformer, but in 3d, and with very limited ammunition (3 magazines for the machinegun). You will -literally- need to scavenge for every magazine, everytime you fight.

Don't be fooled, it's bad. Stupidly bad."
"Apparently, Bethesda did not learn its lesson what happens when it tries to copy EA's path. They removed all their games from Geforce Now. This ridiculous. I paid for this game and I should be able to play any where I want. I will not buy any other Bethesda title unless they treat us fair again.
BRING THIS GAME TO GEFORCE NOW BACK!"
Boring game
YUCK! :P
"I played the game because I like action, horror, guns and gore stuff. The game satisfied me with my expectations, but there was a big problem for me. I didn't know where to go most of the time. And it's so frustrating after a time."
"2020, thought to give Doom a try.
Just as a heads-up: I've played the original Doom games when they first launched. Yeah, the very old ones (Duke Nukem, Heretic, Hexen, Wolfenstein, etc). 

Positive thingies:

- Runs well on an i7-8700K with a RTX 2080Ti.

Negative thingies:
- The game does not recognize a standard 21:9 resolution (3440x1440) when starting the game. You'll get a peasantry resolution which you have to change. Strangely, the main menu doesn't have a straight up [Settings] button. You have to click on Campaign, select a save slot and afterwards you'll get to Settings. I find this amateurism.

- Motion sickness. Yeah, you heard that right. Though I played hundreds of FPS during my 25-years gaming experience, the movement of this game causes nausea. And I am used to fast paced FPS. As a comparison, I loved playing Quake 2 and Unreal Tournament.

Raising the FOV and disabling motion blur does not help. The overall pace of movement and animations are just chaotic.

- I despise the yellowish color palette. Makes everything look so dull. Reshade is recommended for those who share my thought.

- Weapons are underwhelming: Haven't played much, but the pistol and shotgun are so weak, while the melee attack is OP. This game should be a gun feast, but it is just so boring to have pea shooters. Why should I bother with guns, when I can just spam my melee attack and get the job done fast? Add to that the fact that you constantly run out of ammo. 

- There isn't any spatial sound. You'll hear a foe who grunts above or below you, to your left or right. You turn and there's no one. Few seconds you realize that the foe is above or below you. Sound immersion 0.

If you consider any of the above negative thoughts to be a downer for you, then hey, you're in the same boat with me and I don't recommend buying Doom.
If you can live with them, then by all means, buy the game."
"Unfortunately we are seeing the downsides to DRM like steam this week. I own this game on steam, but if I login to steam using a GeForce Now server I cannot play this game that I own. Bethesda and other publishers are asking steam to prevent this and they are obliging."
"EDITED 07.31.22

After many, many hours of playing Doom Eternal I have amended some of the gripes I had with 2016, while others have become even more aggravated.
1. Unbalanced difficulty - Nightmare suffers most from this, in particular. Some of the Heavy demons get trivial while the Imps are as imposing as bosses due to their aimbot.
2. Snapmap is extremely limited and doesn't hold a candle even to the early OG Doom level editors. But at least it's something, rather than the big bowl of nothing we have in Eternal.
3. Zero replayability, if you're not interested in an Ultra-Nightmare run. Eternal makes an attempt to mitigate this with Master Levels and Horde Mode.
4. Mediocre multiplayer. And it's dead, too!
5. The garbage constant red/brown color scheme of the campaign that constantly make some enemies camouflage themselves. The later Multuplayer maps are much more vibrant and colorful. Thankfully, Eternal goes full force with colors.
6. If you're a completionist, the sheer amount of Points of No Return in campaign levels that cause you to restart the entire level when you miss a secret WILL make your blood boil. I am SO thankful that Eternal gets fast travel points when you're about to complete a level!

Overall, it's fine for a single playthrough (not counting Ultra-Nightmare) and mucking around with friends on Snapmap, but not for much else."
"Good game. However, Bethesda's move to remove it from Nvidia's GeForce Now is a stellar example of corporate greed and betrayal of customers. Bethesda shouldn't have the right to tell me on which and whose hardware I play the game that I legally purchased and paid for."
"Game starts on 2nd Screen and stays Black, are we in 2006?
Now i need to find a fix for this sh..."
"Enemies are bullet sponges and multiplayer is boring

I seriously don't understand the appeal of this game... just walk around and punch things while good music plays for 10% of your playtime? How immersive"
"Overrated as fuck. Combat is boring and simplistic and that's like 90% of the game. Audio is also bad, its very noticeable if you turn off the music, its like there is absolutely zero echo/reverb and zero dynamics. If the game costed a fraction of what it does, I might recommend it, but I think it's absolutely not worth paying that much money for a game like this."
"It didn't take long for me to figure out that this game wasn't for me. It's not a knock on the game though, at least not wholly. The way this game handles movement is very disorienting for me, and everything from running to camera movement is actually *too* smooth for my eyes to deal with, which is a sentence I never thought I'd have to write. Fact is, the game for some reason just makes me dizzy as heck, to the point of actually feeling sick if I play it for more than an hour at a time. I'm an edge case and I don't hide that, but if it happens for me, it may well happen for someone else so I figured I'd at least put this in writing for those select few people.

This is a great game that is a genuine throwback to the best of 90's shooters, but if you're prone to motion sickness or dizziness, consider yourself duly warned."
"Bought it because of GeForce Now.

Failthesda withdrew from Geforce now."
"I bought this game for use with geforce now. After almost two weeks, Bethesda withdraws her from the service. Kick in the balls for the fan"
"Liked it at first. Now that I bought it myself and revisited it. I hate it.
it is boring and repetitive.

the checkpoint saving system is something wrong. If you consider that you have to scavenge a lot for ammo and armor. It happened to me that I missed a few jumps and instantly died. SO I had to run a lot to get the armor and ammo from different places and the try the jumps again.

And why does the player have no legs? Is this still a thing?"
"Very repetitive, I turn it on for some mindless fun but always end up closing it after just 2 hours or so. It's pretty much the same thing over and over in different locations. Not a bad game but nothing to keep me hooked. Soundtrack is great though."
"Doom has a great gameplay, it's fun to play and it's definitely worth getting acquainted with, perhaps, purchasing through some ultimate sale, or by not purchasing at all. Then why do I say ""I do  not recommend it""? 
Well, because as an AAA project with full price (on launch), this glitchswamp abandonware has no right to exist. Bugged achievements, 4k crashing my monitor, infuriating UI decisions, which require you to enter startup arguments to fix some of them, and others are just bad code. Totally f****d up physics sometimes throwing you in the nearest wall, and OMG that collision of rocket launcher's projectiles. Levels designed without clear articulation of the allowed and not allowed places. That all happened to me. Now read all the forums with hundreds of pages complaining on this game. Oh and the ending is so predictable and so disappointing.
Summary: did I enjoy smashing demons? Yes, very much. Did I enjoy the GAME? Not so much."
"Bought this game and several others because I could play on Geforce Now as I have no gaming PC or current gen console. Now I can't play it because the publisher is greedy and pulled their games from the service. Obviously won't be buying their games anymore as I couldn't play them if I wanted to. Good job alienating a group of paying customers. What difference does it make how I play the game so long as I buy it? It's not like the publisher makes money from me buying expensive computer hardware to play the game, they definitely won't get my money if I don't buy the game simply because I don't have the resources to play it.

In short, I bought the games purely because I have Geforce Now, without Geforce Now I won't be buying more since I can't play games without it."
"Pulled from Geforce NOW, not good at all"
"The game is great. But, since I paid for the game, and it's tied to my steam account, I should be able to install it and play from any of my PCs, even via the cloud. The fact that I can't play through GEForce Now, or buy a copy as a gift for someone with a non-gaming PC to play on GEForceNow, is B********it. Fix this Bethesda!"
Too many demons for my liking
"So I've literally bought Doom, Dishonored 2 and Wolfenstein: Shadow of the Colossus to play them for the first time on Geforce Now. Created a Steam Account for this. And now practically I need to play those games on my PC, which I hate and actually can't. I will never get to play them, literally they have 2 minutes of playtime each.
As I'm not even able to see the menu right now, this games deserves -10 stars."
"Doom: Battle Arena.  Rinse and repeat: open door, fight enemies, unlock door and continue.  There was many fold more creativity and care gone into the older versions.  Even Doom 3, which had a somewhat similar rinse and repeat felt far more thought out.

Played Doom primarily on a friend's computer and was let down, but decided to try it again on a free weekend and was reminded of why it feels just so dry and bland.  Throwing in gore does not cover up the lack of design or care.  Don't be strategic with your actions and combat, no, just run in.  This version of Doom has become exactly what every other first person shooter has become, a bland repaving of 'put in more action'."
"Good game. One of the best modern day first person shooters, and it's destined to be a classic. I can't give the game a positive review though, since for some reason on my computer it crashes every 20 minutes."
game doesnt even fgcking launck gaddam
"The audio in the game is a cacophony of gargling, screaming, and gunshots. I play with headphones and honestly I can barely tell whats going on half the time. It just makes me feel anxious and uncomfortable. The gameplay is fun but I cant get past that horribly disorienting feature. I cant even enjoy the voice acting while in a fight since I cant hear them over the sounds of demons coming from every angle. Its incredibly disappointing to have everyone I know tell me to get this game for me to hate playing it. 

I'm sure if you have a better audio setup or something the game is a lot more fun but for me its not worth the money."
"I'd been looking forward to playing this game for quite a while as my old graphics card didn't run it very well at all.
Having upgraded my PC this was one of the first games I tried and I've been left underwhelmed.
The environments are interesting but are let down by poor quality textures which just look out of place.
The game play is very arcadey and seems to be based around clearing an area and moving on giving little bursts of action and no sense of discovery or exploration.
Despite the games age several technical issues persist including an annoying issue with the game overriding Windows and choosing it's own audio device.

If I hadn't owned the game for so long without being able to play I'd be requesting a refund."
"ID and Valve blow balls. Went to restart a level to get to a hidden item and the game reset ALL of my gameplay for the day. I lost 8 hours of playing time, achievements, runes, etc.

Googling I find out this has been an issue for YEARS and is still not resolved.

Well....there goes a sale ID and Valve because I WILL NOT buy the new version. No excuse for these bugs to last this long."
"It's basically a glorified arena shooter. I've played doom 1, 2, 3, 64.... This DOES NOT capture what originally made doom great. Graphics are always nice, but it means nothing to a lot of us if you completely change the gameplay in what essentially feels like a round of quake or invasion- over and over and over and over. 

If it isn't broke don't fix it... the older dooms had levels and enemy placement that felt good. This just feels lazy. Hop into this room, lockdown and kill all the monsters. Rinse and repeat. I'm not looking forward to the next one if this is the 'new' formula I.D. is going for. It is a shame too, because we can imagine what doom would be like if we stuck to the original idea.

Everything except for the gameplay looks and sounds great, but the gameplay is just hyperactive twitch shooting in an arena for the most part. Very disappointing. I had to force myself to finish this after starting it up multiple times just so I would get this out of my backlog. 

You can polish a turd until it shines beatifully, but in the end, its still a turd.... A shiny, beatiful turd of what doom used to be"
ok doomer
"Garbage.. Just another crappy arcade shooter, but with the name doom on it."
"Bought it, played it for an hour, and spent most of my time searching where to go cause all the places look exactly the same.
Boring in my opinion."
It's not for me. I'll try to finish it but this is the last Doom game I'll play.
"The multiplayer has and always will be garbage. All of the cry babies who complained of hackers ad nauseam in 2016 and 2017 are the only fools STILL playing a game that was never popular. And guess what -- they are all running hacks. It's pathetic, embarrassing, and a shame the platform fails to do anything except lean back and count bills while people spend hard earned cash on games that are never level playing fields from launch. F you Steam, and F you iD/Bethesda. I'll never drop a dime on your products again. 

Oh and the campaign is legit."
"@10 hours play time....An OK game. fast paced, lots of weapons and monsters/demons. beautiful level design.


EDIT:
@16+ hours play time..., game has become very repetitive. so much so that I have become bored to the point of not caring if I finish it or not.


Edit2:
At 21 hours I uninstalled. it's just the same thing over and over, and over, and over."
Stop advertising games in games !
corrupt save file make me lose all my progress. Great job Bethesda
"I have 4 hours on the game, 3 hours of it i spend looking for hidden stuff and secrets in case i missed an upgrade.

Judge this as you will."
"Very boring,
after twenty minutes of play,
I was annoyed,
and I stopped.

Always the same game‑mechanic,
since 23 years.

I didn’t find it fun.

I played with Wolfenstein شيطان and Doom in 1994.
I had 14 year,
now I think : « big mistake and huge waste of time »."
"Tried starting this game a couple times and its just shoot punch, shoot punch, move fast, shoot punch. Most boring game I've ever played aside from Warframe."
"The Game is very overrated I finished it in 8h and was pretty dissapointed with the story mode, the first 2-3h are very good, you get new weapons you fight new enemys and the game makes you feel like a complete Badass but it gets old very fast, the boss fights are pretty boring especially the last one, the levels are all the same (except for the tower one and the Vega one those ones were very very good), Hell just doesnt feel like hell at all, Im very dissapointed with Doom I also want to say that i took my time with the game, I didnt rush it i tried to explore everything that i could and still finished the game in 8h, as for the multiplayer mode its basically Quake (but i have to say that the Snapmap feature is pretty cool). So yea i dont recommend this game at all."
"I just couldn't get into this.  It was a slog to log even 90 minutes.  At each mission complete screen, I'd invariably save and quit because I just wanted to do anything else.  Perhaps worse, this was one of the rare games where I had zero desire to go off the beaten trail hunting secrets and super tough boy points or whatever they're called - I just rushed as quickly as I could to the end.  At each summary screen, the game would tell me how bad of an explorer I was, and I was fine with it.

I found the combat tedious, particularly the glory kill mechanic, which is cool for maybe the first 5 chumps whose jaws you punch through their rib cages.  The vertical movement was clunky and irritating, which hurt the fast paced style they advertised.  Most of the encounters were uninspired, and I found the level design to be either boring or confusing.  Also, in a game supposedly all about high octane slaughter, most enemies spent all their time running away from me.  Not even getting the absurdly gas-guzzling chainsaw could salvage things for me.

The tone is likewise uninspired.  Between the glory kills, the silly metal soundtrack, and the few ""story"" moments where your guy just gets angry and smashes computers and elevator buttons, it all felt really ham-fisted.  It's like the whole game was developed after someone dug up my old middle school trapper-keeper and found a doodle of punch-gun man, who has shotgun knees and wears an awesome trench coat.  Which, that would be fine if the game was built around that kind of goofy tone.  But the environment here just doesn't support that.

Speaking of (and to say something nice), the environments themselves were beautifully rendered.  The explosions from grenades or the barrels haphazardly left all over the place were very satisfying.  The game ran wonderfully, and the guns I did unlock were enjoyable to use.

Maybe if I'd played the original Doom games, this would have grabbed more of me, but I kind of doubt it.  Nostalgia can only go so far.  The only one I've ever really played was Doom 3, which was apparently an outlier.

If the idea of killing a bunch of losers as a, frankly, juvenile vision of badassdom sounds tiring, I'd avoid this."
"It's very fun combat, but quite easy and even on high difficulty battles tend to end quick. After this is annoying jump and run... and more annoying - rune challenges.

If you like arcade Doom - you will have fun
For me is a big annoyance. 

P.S: I'm coming back for the combat, tho"
Froze at loading screen after start up. Refunded.
"Was a good a game, now so painfully riddled with cheaters I really hope you save your money..."
Low ammo count violence orgy. Personally didn't enjoy it much.
"Nothing like forced masochism. Griefy checkpoint system, active anti mod, active anti save share, awful level design, no cheats. In short absolutely no way to appreciate the game as a piece of art or play it in any way divergent from COD. 

Seriously need to take a minute to expound a bit, this level design is terrible. Clearly the goal was to make it Q3 style arena shooter, nothing like a defensible position anywhere, That means no hallways, no staircases, no balconies. These things exist but there's always a breaking aspect. And if there isn't expect enemies to flat out teleport up your ass.

And yet they want it to hopefully pass as an actual human built facility. It doesn't without serious disregard or oblivity. The result in any case is schizophrenic architecture that would give Lovecraft's outer horrors a headache that despite that lacks any hint of freedom. The entire thing is composed of invisible walls in the form of shit you can't break or climb over or through resulting in a monorail experience. Doubly ironic considering all the literal holes in the engine speed runners found. 

I suppose that makes sense, Lovecraftian architecture, holes in reality. QED.

Also the platforming.... Just wow. Every possible fail was crammed in to this level design.

Insecure tryhard epeen mentality taking a warm dump on Doom's legacy of freedom and enjoyment on the player's terms. No cheats. No mods. IN A DOOM REBOOT. It's like rebooting mario cart and not having power ups. The greed is real.

Doom 2016 is an absolute chore shooter and you WILL play it as the devs prefer, or not at all.

Good thing I only spent 6$. 

Seriously what is wrong with people? Who enjoys being completely stripped of all agency and being given pointless tasks purpose built to be annoying? Everyone but me apparently.

Edit: Updates on 2020-02-18 1121 AM and I found a cheat mod that makes it remotely playable as a casual artistic experience, as opposed to the epeen ""I'm such a baydayss dude check out mah flames!"" trash lamented above. (Literal flames in doom eternal FWIW. This entire review applies there also minus the even trying for realism bit.)"
"It's just not fun. This is the second time I've tried to play this game in the last few years and already I want to uninstall it and move on since it is once again not even mildly amusing. There are numerous annoyances that are not easily dismissed such as splash screens, a map that doesn't remember preferences and voices that keep repeating the same useless message over and over again.

The action moves too fast compared to other earlier FPS titles which means that reactions are too twitch based and do not allow for sufficient strategy development which in turn makes all the weapon mods difficult to learn and appreciate."
"I've been a fan of Doom ever since the first version came out on DOS, and spent a lot of fun hours playing solo and with friends and creating custom maps etc. As such i was quite thrilled to see the reimagining with modern graphics and techniques, and I was going to give it a solid recommendation after seeing the result and getting some basic gameplay in, finding the challenge interesting with pretty smart AI ranged aiming etc. (although once you figure out how it ""thinks"" it becomes less of a challenge).

That is, until it became painfully clear what the game mode of this game is; no matter what environment you are in (which are nicely crafted!) the basic gameplay is this:
1. Enter room
2. Room closes, locking you in
3. You kill x enemies in the room
4. Room opens up and you continue down the otherwise completely linear map
5. Rinse and repeat

Each room being relatively small, arena-style areas where the enemies get game-cheating advantages to provide ""challenge"" (in quotes).
The bosses are just bullet sponges to make them tough, but really, making them very bland endurance fights is pretty lame.

So, overall verdict: it's pretty, well made in terms of visual appeal (if you don't get tired of the repetitive nature of animations), but the actual gameplay just absolutely kills this as a negative. Sorry folks, nice try but I can't honestly recommend it after a number of hours of play."
"Don't think I have ever disliked such a technically competent, visually pleasing and nicely scored game, but after the moderate fun of the first few levels, it felt like a chore and I had to force myself to finish the last few levels to reclaim my SSD space. I like the engine, Vulkan API feels like the future and the models of monsters and weapons are good if somewhat generic. The levels are also visually nice, though I liked Mars much more than hell. I just hate the gameplay choices. Seeing the same finishing animations and locking the player into rooms with a dozen monsters at a time are tropes that get old really fast and bigger monsters are bullet sponges that feel like cardboard you occasionally clip through with no physics. I basically hateplayed it to the end to be free of it."
"black screen on startup still an issue after 6 years very good stuff id, fix ur game b4 churning out more shit for ms"
Would it kill them to make a good game?
doesnt boot
"Triple AAA game. 
Multi-million project from a huge game company. 
I only get a black screen."
its a fucking headache but fun
"Нorrible optimization, does not start on nvidia 780 graphics card"
"Doom is one hell of a game. One of the best FPS campaigns, If I could've finished the fucking game. Halfway into the game, and I glitched through a wall that caused me to skip a few checkpoints. Didn't have the right item to progress in that area and had to restart the game. Game save got corrupted. Bethesda, please fix the game breaking bugs on a fucking 4 year old game. Other than that, 8/10 IGN Makes you feel like one badass mofo."
Rip and try to hold back tears
"Game worked for about 2 hours then never worked again.  Blue and black screens of death constantly.  Developers are posting garbage fixes like command line statements and installing framework or C++ specific versions that don't work.  I've had temporary fixes using everything from nvidiaInspector hacks, disabling SLI, to reinstalling the game and graphic drivers.  None work permanently.  Broken mess.  I've literally spent twice the time attempting to fix the game than I've played it.  I'm uninstalling and reinstalling my bootleg version from launch time that I know actually works.  I'll be damned if I want to pay full price for the sequel if they can't even get this right."
This game does not run in Linux any more. I want my money back.
so far no news. purchased last night and still can't get it to start........
Amazing that I install after over a year of playing and old bugs still haven't been fixed.
"A disgusting shooter with a stupid rethinking of the plot, with constant finishing off opponents for the sake of bullets.
Frankly weak multiplayer."
"The Good so far (3 hours, 4 weapons found):
- Graphics
- Level design not linear
- Soundtrack
- Adrenalinic during battles

The Bad:
- fucking checkpoints... on high difficulty if you die you must kill over and over again the same fucking daemons (or recover same fucking armor, or walk along the same path, or do again the same fucking thing that you didn't do when the game decided to save your progress) losing time uselessly until you reach new checkpoint.If I were masochist and i liked to fight same battles or see same places endlessly i would play Prepare to die, not Doom. It's almost game breaking for me.

- doom 2 with sprint speed and a fucking double barrel shotgun was much much better, more adrenalinic, more frenetic, more satisfying.

-Disappointing physic of bullets impact, enemies sometime seem to be like a sort of bullet sponges with almost no reaction to hits.. and shotgun seems to fire blanks even on close combat.

-even if he runs, doomguy is slooooow, firepower so far has been replaced by ""fatalities"" but meh.. i want point-blank instakill shots back... 

-Again, when i use my shotgun a few inches from an imp, the poor creature should EXPLODE and the corpse should be thrown back in a blaze of blood, not just almost ignore the hit or sway like a drunk waiting for fatality, for god sake!  

So...
At the moment i can recommend doom only if you aren't a fan of old doom games ....and if you endure checkpoints and fatalities."
"I love the soundtrack music to this game, which is great because the game itself has ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND.
Nothing during gameplay at all, pure silence.
I can hear the proud swish of IDSoftware on startup and a low hum during loading screens but that's it.

Mick Gordon is the only reason I haven't refunded yet.  I'll go listen to him and play a game with sound instead."
"The game wouldn't load but I managed to fix it after a while of looking up fixes, but everytime I tried start arcade, singleplayer or anything like that it just freezes, After Looking up fixes and nothing working I had to unfortunately refund it, Shame."
"Platforming, weapon upgrades and repetitive gameplay. In a nutshell you just enter from arena to arena and fight your way towards the end. It's boring as hell. No real feeling of progress. Just same looking corridors and research facilities over and over again. And the guns. Only the BFG9000 felt powerful and satisfying to use.
Pinky demon takes 6 rocket launcher hits??! Cacodemon takes 5?! What is this shit? Not anything I'd expect from a Doom game. I so much wanted to like this, but let's be honest here. This is not very appealing as a Doom game nor generic FPS. In every way it's uninspiring, mediocre, repetitive, generic arena shooter with no real feeling of progress.
It does run well thou and I only encountered one glitch during my 2 playthroughs and it was not game breaking. So, if you're in to arena fights in same looking enviroments it's just the game for you."
"The review for true doom fans.

There's no middle thumb so... Doom 2016 is basically just a generic FPS that was over-hyped something fierce.  For an aging gamer like myself, Doom 2016 was nothing special on release and the fact they had screwed up the multiplayer and had no level editing what-so-ever in the traditional id software sense was maddening by itself.  But since Zenimax bought out id software and John carmack one of the last original founders of id left id hasn't been the same since and you can feel it in the direction of the game.

In the 90's back when the original doom's were released.  Doom ushered in game modding on the PC and to have a game that gave birth to modding not have the open ness of the tools the devs used to build the game with is maddening.  Part of the reason modern AAA gaming sucks is the removal of tools from the end users and community.   Which left the doom mod community in a lurch when we knew we were getting the garbage snap ""editor"" in which pre-fabbed rooms can be stitched together in simple ways but bars the complex level editing of the original dooms.

In comparison to Doom 3, Doom 3 had a better feeling world and atmosphere than Doom 2K16 even if Doom 2016 is better looking and has faster combat, there's something artificial about doom 2k16 that is offputting, especially in the later levels that really drag as you move from locked room to locked room to clear the waves for the doors to open.  A feature that becomes super annoying if you replay the game to try to clear all the secrets.

On the whole the game design is uninspired and you'd best off looking into the original doom/doom 2 and getting the fan made updates with brutal doom and checking out fan made levels if you're looking for new and interesting gameplay.  Doom 2K16 is everything right and wrong about game design, the game is too focus group tested to bring anything new to the table because the people at id were fearful about alienating 'modern gamers'.

There's also something floaty and gimmicky about the glory kills that get really old, really fast, thereby defeating their purpose.  Many of the glory kills and how you perform them is not obvious, why is that a problem?  When upgrading runes or doing challenges they want you to do certain glory kills in order to get the upgrade/do the challenge.  Knowing you have to specifically look at certain body parts while enemies are staggered can be realyl annoying because you literally have to experiment multiple times while combing over every angle to figure out which performs what specific glory kill.

The story tragically is typical programmer garbage, something a bunch of stupid teenagers who are tech geeks and haven't read much in their lives would come up with.  The potential for dooms world is there buy the way in which what little story there is, is presented, is largely bad and you're really on your own to read codex's.  But long story short, the story is simply tacky and you won't even know what is really going on unless you go out of your way to stitch things together.  There is a reason for this:

Hugo on robocop as inspiration:

Watching that noclip you can see that the original devs have gotten far away from what the original doom games are about, it's sad that there is no modding or level editing tools because the doom community would have went ape-$h*t and fixed all sorts of things that were wrong with the game.

At this point in time I can safely say doom 2k16 is a skippable fps and you should only get it at a discount.  The game has very little replayability.  The multiplayer is largely dead unless you use the ""Teamplay option"" since the way they coded the game is screwed up compared to quake where you'd just run your own dedicated server.

All in all Doom 2K16 is a typical one shot game, you go through the campaign and simply never touch it again."
It's 2020 and this game still has bugs that cause lock-ups and crashes to desktop. Skip it and wait for Doom Eternal and hope they don't screw up like they did with this game.
Pretty good.
"I loved the classic doom games, also doom3, but this one is not at all as good as expected.
The gun fights are not challenging, grenade explosions sound really weak, the music is annoying.
Instead of creating an intimidating and thrilling atmosphere they made every room full of flickering lights combined with annoying villains or advisors talking to you on speakers.
The levels seem to consist mostly of arena-like-fights, where you have to eliminate a couple of waves of enemies, and when you killed them all you are allowed to proceed.
I can see that many people have fun with this game. And if the gore and the fast paced shooting action suffice to call it a great game, well then ok. I got bored really quickly."
"The game is VERY boring, for me at least. Graphically is ok and everything seems to be fine - but it is too little to make this game great (or even good). The Doom 3 was fantastic comparing to this one. Anyway, it is my opinion."
"Game crash. Save file corrupt.

Try every fix online. Save file corrupt.

Download a save from online. Save file corrupt."
"I struggle to see why this game gets such high praise and love, in my opinion, it's average AT BEST.

The gameplay is boring and super repetitive. You would think that coming from the ID Software - the pioneers behind FPS shooter genre would bring a game into more dynamic experience, but nope, the only one mechanic that remotely resembles the said trait is a double jump, which essentially feels too arcadey and less engaging as a result, compared to the sprint/bunny hop mechanic which in the game of this caliber should be essential, otherwise it becomes boring with lack of speed.

And boring it sure is, the level design is uninspired. While levels are big, vast, and often has not only linear but vertical progression(for secrets and stuff) it often feels like a chore. Doomguy is very slow, so trying to find more secrets and items is a tiresome process. It doesn't have any sprint mechanic(like in OG games), it doesn't have any bunnyhopping(like in a Painkiller game, which essentially is the same single-player arena-based shooter) There's no real sense of speed, so the combat feels lacking as well.

Art direction and the graphic design are very shallow and don't have any type of details, that were present in Doom 3 in its unique setting of horror and dark tight corridors. Having the headline such as the RIP & TEAR tells you everything from a start with a very self-explanatory fashion - this is a passable experience with zero details or depth. As a result, you have a game with pretty, but uninspired visuals, that have that very distinct purpose to the player of being overwhelming and easy to notice. Everything is lit and colorful, enemies have that plastic feel to their bodies, making encounters feel all the same with no lack of character to the enemy. There's no sense of self-presence, you won't feel engaged in the scene of the combat, as the atmosphere is lackluster.

And then there's a problem with gameplay standpoint. A glory kills the mechanic which essentially is a legit press F to kill. It feels repetitive just after the first 20 mins of playing a game which says a lot. And since it's tied into the game design, it's pretty hard to play without it, because it's a tool to refill your ammo and health. It's one of those bad game design choices, that makes this glory kill encounter a mess every time. It messes up the flow of the combat, you see the same animations over and over again with zero transition frames so the scene looks rough all the time. It even locks your fov from customized 130 to the 90 just for this animation sequence. So much for smooth gameplay, I guess. Not to mention the constant problems with the movement. Apparently, doomguy can't move freely over the 5cm cables on a floor, stopping all the movement momentum.

It's a mess of a game in my opinion — boring, uninspired and gameplay gimmick doesn't add up to it. It feels dated, Bulletstorm or Painkiller is a better example of games that done right in this regard.

Not to mention the classics of Serious Sam, which frankly, albeit having almost non-existent budget compared to this title, had a much more engaging soundtrack, than your average WUB-WUB. At least Sam could keep my interest throughout the whole game.

Still trying to complete it through the power of my effort, but can't be bothered to play more than 30 minutes. It's just not an impressive or engaging title. Just as your typical Bethesda really - average work, commonly even less than that, but overhyped to the magnum opus standards.

I can't agree with that, will not agree with that."
"Jumping on levels was fun in Super Mario Bros.,  but this is like pushing Boston dynamics' robot off the cliff. Over and over again. Occasionally some zombie-demon-alien- meat bags emerge, you shoot them, and continue climbing that frigging tower. Why should I play this when it's not fun?"
took five hours to get of a black screen
"A very boring shooter, compared to Brutal Doom or Doom 3, not to mention modern shooters like Wolfenstein."
When you play doom 2016: PEGGERS
"Just really underwhelming. More like Painkiller than Doom.

Looks nice and the shooting is fine, but the general repetitive gameplay loop of rooms locking down and several waves of enemies becomes tedious as ""hell"". Just Play original Doom wads via GZdoom instead, as it's far more satisfying."
"Like it's a'ight. It's just mega over hyped as everything else sucks so bad at the moment.

I'm a moany old man who grew up on Doom/Doom II, my major issue is that this game doesn't get the atmosphere right, It looks like greasy plasticine with a lego man and feels like every other generic sci-fi FPS from the last decade. Just compare the Cyber Demons, one looks like a horrific tortured monster with machinery butchered onto its body and the other looks like a big purple teddy bear wearing a bin liner. The story is dumb, but sort of fun, but mainly dumb, at least they didn't mention anything about pet rabbits. I feel sorry for Bethesda who get picked on by consumers for expecting a billion dollar games company to lip sync the only character with lips and about three lines of dialogue, in protest to these greedy ungrateful gamer's Bethesda have refused to bother fixing any bugs in this game. 

This game is like the fun brightly coloured kids TV show version of Doom 3 and that's where it works. It's fun and it's fast and you don't have to think about it too much. It's the antidote to every game with regenerative health and aiming from behind cover. 

doom 2016 is fine, its just to me its more of a remake of Corridor 7 than Doom. I think the new Bethesda Wolfenstein games are better and more interesting and I would recommend them instead."
"The game play starts fun but gets super repetitive by being balanced around executions (which means the action stops for a little cut scene), and also still suffers from technical issues.  Load time are terrible at all stages of the game including the initial loading,you can't skip the idiotic villain ranting cut scenes, multiple monitor doesn't work properly.  Essentially any time you are not actively in control of your character and shooting is the time when the game is absolute garbage.  The time when you are in control and actually playing is IMO not quality enough to justify the issues."
for some reason i get this fatal error screen every time i launch it and the game refuses to work im worried i just wasted my money....
"Ammo, health and armor scarcity makes this game a very annoying thing to play.
Add to that the necessity to be constantly making quick time events to restore ammo and health. 

There is a great game hidden in here, but these mechanics just ruin what could have been one of the best fps ever."
"What would be a really fun demon slaying fun by utterly one track mind protagonist (don't look for deeper story - it is not here - you are here just for gory fun) is severely marred by totally idiotic decision to lock progression behind secrets (which now are MANDATORY if you do not want to be a gimp) and totally retarded challenges (which takes you out of the fun part of the game and shoves into a tiny map with stupid objective with totally retarded restrictions) which - surprise - are also mandatory, if you don't want extra ""challenge"" playing as a gimp. Do you remember good old days where secrets and challenge bullshit were OPTIONAL? Yea, good old days.. Too bad they are gone..."
vomit feeling
"This game sucks. For one, it takes up 70GB of space when it's completely unnecessary. (Shows that the dev team didn't k now how to efficiently store their data) Playing the game is just like any other FPS, but it's just so stripped down. There's no semblance of a storyline, you move WAAAAAYYYY too fast which is disorienting, and the drops don't add anything to the challenge.

I literally just glory killed all of the mobs everywhere straight through the second chapter of the game. If I die, I restart nearby where I died, so it doesn't add to the challenge.

It just doesn't hold my attention, and I see why it's only a $6 game. It could have been really good if they gave it some effort."
"SHIT HUMAN BEINGS IN MULTIPLAYER WHIOI FUCKING XCHEaT, FUCK THEM"
"It didn't feel challenging or fun. The guns felt blase and hit like nerf. The enemies were just bullet sponges, nothing special. Not the game I remember from my childhood."
GOOD GAME GOOD GAME
payday2 not find epic online service. i cant play the game online  at steam?
unbelievably buggy garbage
Crashing and Infinite loading galore! Yay! Seeing one of your favorite games be in such a bad state is a real bummer!
bad
crashes too much cant even finish a heist without it crashing
"It was better when it was simpler, now it needs a PhD just to name all the heists. I am also [b]not[/b] paying more than the base game price on additional content that [i]definitely[/i] doesn't take twice the effort to make the base game, otherwise you'd have a better sequel- oh wait, lol. Also practically impossible to 100% achievements unless you get [i]robbed[/i] (pun intended) and have both willing friends to help you and have a life."

"I used to enjoy this game a lot long time ago. 
Have returned after a while and now I find this game literally unplayable with the way it randomly freezes in a mid-game and kicks all your buddies.
Found no fix of this problem, there are plenty of players having the same issue though. 
Not worth bying at the moment."
"retconned playable characters, weapons, heists, etc. that you can't get anymore, horrible performance issues, game repeatedly freezes and crashes despite troubleshooting everything, i've loved this game since 2013, and it is a lot of fun, but this is not worth your time or money to try and deal with the headache of just trying to make the game function as it's supposed to"

"The newer heists crash constantly, modding is a slippery slope, and build 42 completely fucked everything up.  Thanks Overkill."
bought 1 dlc and now the game wont even start :|
"This game has hard crashed my experience for the last time. My game freezes right in the middle of a heist which then forces me to hard reset my computer. I can't Alt+F4 it no matter what. Just freezes my screen. 

This has happened numerous times and have tried to uninstall, reinstall files, lower graphics settings, and took to every Reddit post I can find. And I am done with it. Not worth any money, not even on sale. Screw this game and the devs who made it.

Also, for the record, I run no mods at all and this problem still happens constantly."
not fun anymore
Lame
too much content

I peronaly dislike the game. The game is good for the first  10 hours after that it becomes repetitive.

"Playing in singleplayer makes this game easily the worst experience I've ever had in my life. Unironically, Roblox's Entry Point gives a much better stealth singleplayer experience than this game.

Menus and UI sucks. As a new player, this shit is impossible to navigate. I wasted so many skill points because the UI didn't explain how many of them a skill cost, or that clicking an already-bought skill upgrades it. I spent so much on useless things that even the easiest beginner missions feel harder than they should.

Going stealth successfully requires so many retries, I'd be tempted to say that it'd be almost better to go in guns blazing. But, going loud, either accidentally (some random civilian on the other side of the map calls the police) or by blowing shit up, makes levels a borderline unwinnable mess. 

Bots are beyond useless. They won't carry bags to the van/helicopter unless I manually escort them there like some kind of armed babysitter. This is especially a problem since they only activate when going loud, making running to the van feel like charging through No Man's Land in WWI. This is especially problematic due to the van moving even further away from its starting position when you go loud, because why the fuck not?

I'm not sure if this is a mechanic made for completing a level loud, but Day 2 missions are just an excuse to ruin my progress. They're bad. Really bad. So bad that one time, turning around, all I saw was vertical orange outlines of my bags scurrying away like a fucking swarm of ants.

I get that this game is meant to be played with four people, (and I will try playing levels multiplayer in the future), but if you're a first-timer playing solo, expect frustration.
It's a shame really, because I bought this expecting a fun, chill solo experience. Instead, I got a crash course in frustration and an AI squad that makes COD NPCs look competent."
The game kicks/freezes you mid-game. Needs to be updated!!!

"I bought this game at launch after thoroughly enjoying the original Payday game.

It's been a constant state of disappointment for 12+ years now. Do you like stealth? too bad, the AI has been in various stages of broken since launch and almost always something will go wrong and blow your mission! Do you like not crashing every 7 minutes for a ridiculously long list of random reasons? (Seriously, check your crash log, there's so many ridiculous errors that could easily have been patched over the years) Too bad, hope you weren't playing with a friend, because now you both have to load the game back up, hope you can select the contract by waiting for it to randomly pop up (so you don't have to waste money on it again) and hope you can both make it through the mission without crashing.

I wasn't going to complain about this game given it's age, but given the absolute scam joke that Payday 3 is, this game still is fairly relevant as there aren't many other good games of this genre with co-op still. 

Don't waste your time. Don't pay money for any of the shovelware buggy trash they keep putting out."
Why is No Mercy labeled as stealth?
its bit meh
Shit game deleted my progress
"Not enough, Bing Crosby masks available. Spend your money elsewhere. Give me the whole Rat Pack two while you're at it."
They broke the game because more people were playing PD2 than PD3..
SO MUCH DLCS ITS FUN BUT ITS OVERALL A CASH GRAB.
marvel rivals  and Overwatch is better.
mid graphics and number three is better
"Game is honestly whatever, was just a mindless time sink and got worse with time"
this game is suck you need to buy the dlc to progress in your career
"90% of the ""gameplay"" is waiting. Not 'go to x location and do y' just stand around and defend a drill. Then there's the bugs from not being able to pickup pickup bags to constant crashes. I've played roblox game's better than this crap."
"One of the most godawful experiences ever in regards to stealth, and making sense in general. Starbreeze really has ruined this game. So many game breaking bugs rendering missions that took an hour no longer beatable, 80 cops at once all firing upon me and my friends, It just is pure stress and zero fun nowadays."
"Personally I wouldn't recommend this, as I can't even play with my friends went through 10+hours of fixes, still couldnt play with my friends, however that being said. I am like the only one who can't get the game to work, so if you want to play with your friends you could probably get it to work, that being said buy at your own risk."
not good
"I'd had a mask called ""The Fox"" for god knows how long, I come back to the game just to play with friends and i'm now i'm forced to make an account for ""Starbreeze Neblua"" or whatever the fuck that is, just so Listo can sell my info like he needs more fucking money. There's no reason a COSMETIC item should be stripped just because you want to force people into another service. Sony type ass move."
not enough violence

I wanted to play this game but it literally wont launch from steam. So I had to get it refunded. I might try it again someday but they would have to fix these files or bug causing this to happen.
SHITTY SHIT SHIT SHIT
"its fun if you can pick it up on sale, but the game basically requires dlc to be enjoyable"
Needs more expensive dlcs
this game suck i can't launch
i dislike this game greatly
Used to love this game shame what an unplayable mess it turned into.
Not worth 80gb of data storage.
"cool and amazing gameplay and story, but brain cancer to buy dlc for this game :)
the game should not have paid add-ons where there are weapons of better quality than in the base game"
The game is not good because everything is on a pay wall and low end pcs can NOT play this game it will just crash so yeah this game is BUNS.
Tried it together with a friend but we quickly decided to stop
"removed one of the best heists in the game, and are still charging exorbitant amounts of money for mediocre dlc's."

"If you're ready to not actually play the game while having heavy desync frequently ruining your heists and spam Diamond Store 500,000,000 times because you get an enormous penalty to XP gains if you just play how you want then go ahead."
The UI in this game is unbearable and the game play is extremely confusing and no fun. I got it super cheap on a sale and I'm more upset that I can not get a refund for a couple bucks on this awful game than on any $60 game I ended up not liking.
Another game ruined by cheaters and russians. Buh
Lan game
"if youre considering this or 3, please, PLEASE just buy another game.
Starbreeze have been trying to foot their customers the bill for their terrible TWD game that you cant even buy anymore and deserve to just accept the consequences.
Rather than fix that game or stick to PAYDAY 2 they decided to chase trends and again are forcing their players to pay for their mistake vie microtransactions, more specifically in PAYDAY 3 with its live service model.
you get what you deserve"
"Game sucks, get better game"
haha funny robbing game
Gabigol no cruzeiro e Gusttavo Lima na presidência!
low quality game
Won't recommend getting this it's just crashing every time I load into a heist and I can't find anything to help solve this issue and it's sometimes crashes when I start the game I prefer the ps4 version of the game. maybe look at payday 3
Def not and don't buy 3 either

my game crashed and all of my data just got corrupted :/
roubar e errado
"holy hell this game's player base. i've been ""playing"" for 8 hours but i only played about 4 matches in total because every lobby i try to join, the host would kick me within the first 15 seconds, before the match even starts. Why? idk. my logical guess is that im a new low level player without all the fancy skins. how am i supposed to level up if the community is cancer and doesnt even give me a chance?....

im not even exaggerating when i say that i got kicked from 95 percent of lobbies i joined. Try it yourself."
this game is really disappointing and i didn't enjoy my time playing it
Only fun with friends.
not cool
Yay i love spamming akimbo smg with stoic build SO FUNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stop crashing piece of shit Game
The best worst game ever made.
Just fix all game breaking bugs that's all I want
It just doesn't click for me.

"fun with friends, which is a nice way to say it isnt fun
also 3 sucks so if you want payday just play this
really not that interesting though unless your friendgroup all gets together to play it"
Very repetitive game that boils down to a shooting gallery with video game music in the background...
"To say Payday 2 is a good game would be like telling a liberal that Trump is the right president for America - just an outright lie. In my own personal experience, I have watched this game ravage the mind of an already ADHD-riddled child to point that he could play no other game other than GTA V. I have watched this game possess him to ruin friendships and quite possibly the few romantic relationships he has had. The most sadistic thing about this game, is that it's not even that good. It's basically just Call of Duty but you're robbing banks instead of shooting at Afghans or Russians or Chinese people or Japanese for that matter (Call of Duty has featured a wide range of racial minorities for you to kill). But the aforementioned spectrum child seems to think it's the greatest thing since Dragon Ball Z - this kid also plays Destiny 2, so as far as video games go, he's got no taste. 

To call this a video game is an insult to the industry at large. What it really is, is a torture device, as it drove my friends and I to the point of cutting the spectrum child off, because all he would talk about or want to play was this game. 

To it's developers, I implore you, take this game, take every single copy of it, digital or physical and f**king burn them. Burn them all, and save billions of gamers worldwide from this atrocity of a game. And do the other Payday games as well, they deserve to die by association alone. 

Yours sincerely,
a gamer with taste."
the worst optimized game ive ever fucking played in my entire life. Also  one of the only games on the planet where you can play on the lowest setings and still crash at the end of the heist.
it would be better if it was borderlands 2
"its impossible to have the complete game now,  some content got removed due to licence expiring so if you are a new players you will have a forever incomplete game missing characters/content, not worth."
"If you value your time, do NOT buy this for steam deck.

To say I've been having problems playing this ""steamdeck verified"" game would be a complete understatement. I have has so many technical problems getting this game running that it has killed any and all enjoyment I have had on this game. 

My biggest issue is that there is massive desync problems, but not in the way you think.

Through vigorous testing with someone more familiar with linux (since proton is just a fork of linux) here's what they observed: Say theres three people in the lobby. The host, myself, and a third player. If I am not the second player to join the game, it shows that the other player disconnects and vice versa. I HAVE to be the second person to join, and even then its a crapshoot because it takes two to three attemps to even join; making public lobbies virtually unplayable for me. 

So unless you already have friends who are able to tolerate a few resets, if you buy this multiplayer game on steamdeck expecting to play multiplayer, you might as well be playing a single player game with light multiplayer aspects.

Whats worse is that I've spent two weeks getting this hunk of crap to work and thats just a band aid fix until I can find a legitimate solution. 

Ive put in a steam support ticket and I'll wait to comment on that when they get to me, and I went to Starbreeze's support page to see if maybe they had a solution. The only options they gave me was a redurect to the steam forums and a link to their discord server (which despite having over 20k people in it was very inactive).

Payday 2, when it actually wants to work, is a fun game for sure. But I want to play this multiplayer game like A MULTIPLAYER GAME. And I can't do that without massive work arounds that waste more time. Maybe valve needs to re-evaluate their whole steam deck compatability system because clearly this game does not have it."
nice game but boring.
"Don't understand why this game is so popular, trash. Trying to do GO bank heist, cage assembly area never spawns. Tedious game play waiting for drills, lock picks, just all a big progress bar simulator."
I can't recommend this game because it is almost impossible to play solo. People have jobs and can't be online all the time... Or maybe the people that play Payday are playing this game for practice.
"If you buy pd2 now with no dlcs then you are buying a demo to a unfinished poorly optimized and poorly balanced game that got assasinated by its own development team but i guess if you are into that sort of game its kinda fun

except dead sentence is pretty stupid and anything below it is pretty much a baby game for little babys made by (probably) little babys considering how many bugs and exploits there are

Also theres the fact that payday 2 has the worst stealth in any game to ever exist going from waiting in a corner for a guard to move for 10 seconds to waiting multiple minutes doing literally nothing while a timer counts down to be able to enter a vault and move bags for another 5 to 20 minutes depending on the heist while the most nothing soundtrack plays in the background and you regret your choice of ever touching a videogame while knowing that if you get spotted once then you have to do it all over again (and sadly this is the best way to grind xp and reach lvl 100 as fast as possible so you will have to do this for like 60% of your total playtime if you want to have any actual fun considering almost everything is locked behind a lvl barrier but this was partially fixed with 4.0 so i guess its not as bad as it could be) and im not even gonna mention hostages

Loud is fun for the first few hours but after that it becomes just a snore fest where you end up evaporating cops while they stand no chance to beat you and logically you might want to go a higher difficulty until you reach death wish and at that point (atleast in my 
case) most of the fun will come from making builds, seeing your dmg popups and kill count increase (requires mods tho) and just doing random fun stuff with complete liberty if you are good enough and that isnt a bad thing until you decide to try dead sentence and then realize how much artificial difficulty can damage a games fun factor by making most builds almost impossible to play unless you are pretty much a god and by making the game incredibly punishing preventing most fun plays and turning the gameplay into peeking your head killing 2-7 enemies depending on how op your build is and then going back to hiding unless you want to get 1-shot and it could be fun for some people but no thanks if i wanted to do that i would just play something like csgo (except csgo atleast has stuff like smokes and other mechanics that makes it actually interesting ((actually csgo doesn't exist anymore and cs2 is straight up unplayable so just replace it with any other strategy shooter like valorant or r6)) and if you go back to dw it becomes the same snore fest all over again

another thing that annoys me is how astonishingly bad the ui is (thats it i just think the hud is bad and its not really hard to see why ((also i know that you can add mods to make the ui look better but im reviewing the game not the mods made by the fans of the game that would be like giving minecraft a good review only because you like a random mod that changes the game completely))

Also 90% of the game is locked up behind dlc's so thats fun and totally not a scam"

Was playing The Biker Heist DLC on DEATH SENTENCE. I finally got the mechanic to build the old dude's bike. His name is Rust probably because he's slowly rusting away from his fucking old age. I tried to drive his motorcycle that literally has 0 acceleration leaving me vulnerable and easy to get killed. I managed to move it forward however there was a BUSH with collision WHY THE FUCK DOES A BUSH HAVE COLLISION! I HATE MY LIFE SO MUCH! I DEDICATED 20 MINUTES TO THIS HEIST RIGHT NOW! I THOUGHT I COULD DRIVE THROUGH A BUSH! QARGHHH
it keeps kicking me out for no reason

"incredibly disappointed with payday too, and I’m not sorry this may be because I’ve played at single player, but I also don’t like Left 4 Dead
see 18:14 in Modern Gaming.

Horde games are just bogus and not for me.

and then they give me an option to stay or leave. OK I only have two life left. I don’t like being a quitter. I’m gonna stay and round up the rest of the bodies and then die trying and waste an hour.

gameplay just be like really competitive sorry repetitive*

my second mission was on I believe over-sized Walter White crystal meth easy bake ovens

I’m deeply regretful that I’ve ran out of synonyms to say sorry to Tom for not liking his* most played game on Steam"
"Payday 2 feels like being stuck in the abyss from SpongeBob—you know, that endless, dark void where nothing makes sense, and you’re just... lost. One minute, you’re trying to do a simple heist, then BOOM—you’re overwhelmed by endless waves of cops, the kind that just won’t stop coming, kind of like the abyss never stops being dark. You try to stay calm, but it's like you're sinking deeper and deeper into chaos, with no way out. The sound of alarms? It's like that eerie, endless echo from the abyss. You think you might be getting away with the loot, but then, surprise, you're trapped in a corner with no hope of escape. It’s like a bad dream, where everything you do only makes things worse. The game’s fun, but also feels like you're falling into the abyss of your own bad decisions. You’re just trying to get the money and leave, but nope—this abyss doesn't let you go."
damn
👎
"I accidentally left this game on so these hours are not legit.

Personally coming from l4d and other horde games this one is the most boring. good soundtrack but everyone wanting to stealth constantly rarely going doing it ""loud"" like they say, is boring. that and there are still bugs like the career ""Getting ready"" task that just doesnt want to complete even though ive done everything it asks.

clearly this game is more for the audience that enjoys Thief type of games and less so for people that play vermintide or l4d.

and to top it off after you pay your $10 trial fee you are expected to pay for each and every dlc if you dont want to miss out on content. and the community will die hard defend this gross decision to constantly ask for money cause they think they get ""free"" content when in reality they are just being scammed.

so dont get this if you expect to have full or even half full game. 75% of the game is locked behind dlc."
"Just kinda... lost its magic I guess, it will always be a game that got me into everything but, its just, not *it* anymore."

"A buggy mess. After installing many, many mods in an attempt to make the game playable, it's not.

Avoid this if you can. It's not worth it. 

100% trash"
"After years of thinking about an awesome game ruined by it's live service, after years of unspoken competition between Killing Floor 2 and Payday 2, I can easily announce that Payday 2 is the ultimate game in that regard. Downgraded visuals, abysmal optimization, broken balance, broken AI, a huge degradation in artstyle, lackluster heists with awful story plots and twists, milking every last penny out of the game. There is no game anymore here. It is a game where you pick 2 builds and either you gun down swarms of enemies (and by that I mean SWARMS) or either you just jump around dodging AIs detection percentages. That's it. You're playing with same IZHMA 12G in loud or ""stealthing"" with the same Judge. Nothing changes.  Absolutely no replayability. All the mechanics that are supposed to make the game replayable were just broken over the course of time. Game is just stale, boring, broken, and laggy. This is the prime example of how not to make your game live service. Starbreeze and Overkill should've gone bankrupt in 2015."
It's necessary to buy atleast 20 DLC's to actually be able to play the game
"Requested refund after 30 mins. shouldn't have to piss around with mods on a VR release just to use smooth turning. 
The game looks good although I never got to start playing because unless you can be bothered messing around with mods the controls are fcking useless. using buttons to rotate? wtf!."
EPIC RUINED THIS GAME I HATE EPIC
"In the past this game was great, now this game just crashes for no reason, wouldn't recommend atm, creators just want you to buy payday 3 so they broke this game"
"business stuff:
this ip was murdered by the company who bought it! 
the sequel was also assassinated by the same company with bad business decisions and a lack of focus early on in development! (i still respect the developers i doubt it was easy to deal with the things that led to that)
the payday ip is now going to be thrown at other series to make the money back on payday 3 :) WE'RE DOOOOMED!
(dooming the most popular ip you own for dungeons and dragons live service game is crazy in my opinion but im not a businessbot so what do i know?)

the payday 2 review:
its very easy to throw a few hours at it and have fun! you just have to be aware it is a mess of a game with no future development support (modders have made attempts but starbreeze has left the game in a permanently More unstable state) i actually do recommend this game at its cheapest but i cant give this game a positive review because of Events! there is *Alot* of history in this game and i do think thats worth remembering."
"I love this game. I really do, but I can not in my heart recommend it to anyone. You need to shill out SO MUCH money to even get the most enjoyable heists in the game, and not to mention all the bugs and crashes that can outright ruin your game experience. And let's not even open the can of worms that is the mods. The mods are amazing, don't get me wrong, but Overkill REFUSES to fix this broke dick piece of shit game. If, on the rare chance, they decide to make a MAJOR fix for the game and remake the game in an engine that ISN'T A RACING GAME ENGINE, then I would consider recommending it to others for a fun while, but until then, the only ""loot"" you'll be getting out of this bank is a bundle of frustration and ruined moods."

"Looks good but key critical flaws in first mission. NPC teammates stand in your way when trying to throw loot into the back of the van. I can't make the hostage move, he just stands there.

Im fucking sick of this game sending me a hundred fucking notifications a day
"I pay to play the game and hop on to see that 60% of the content is locked behind paid DLCs.

Garbage netcode makes multiplayer almost unplayable and very frustrating.

"Got this game because I love thief and heist based media. Playing it the game seemed very unresponsive to certain actions such as moving hostages which made it fairly annoying. The game feels less like I'm a thief and more like a shooter/mass murderer. Not really the vibe i was going for, I've since refunded the game."

"There is a good game hidden somewhere in here.

Not anything, anywhere near good enough to excuse the insane amount of paid DLCs, especially when the current game is a shell of its former self due to hidden patch changes to the AI behaviour and spawning.

If you really want to experience a payday game, grab Payday: The Heist on a steam sale and enjoy that instead."
Hostages are bugged. Some missions are impossible to do
"Linux version crashes to desktop. Can play with Proton, but it's a convoluted UI that pushes DLC purchases way too much. I've heard multiplayer is no longer functional for Linux players, but can't confirm it.

I see why people say it turned into a microtransaction cash grab.

update: The above is still true, but I must admit the game is fun. Would I suggest buying it? No. No game that puts out a modest amount of mostly cosmetic content and charges over $200 for it (or something like $112 on the current half off sale) is going to get a recommendation from me. If you have good self control and won't likely find yourself wanting to buy the guns, modifications, skins, etc. that are locked behind additional purchases, it may be worth it. If you find yourself wasting money on absurdly greedy DLC locked content... avoid like the plague."
"Payday 2 is a good game fundamentally. It does what it wants to do well. However this game has a multitude of issues and bugs. I have had more issues playing this game than most others on steam. It has a tendency to crash or boot people from the game, and with all the dlcs locked or removed makes this game jarring at best, and frustrating at worst. If you like horde shooters, and can tolerate bugs, then more power to you friend, otherwise find another game."

"Game Review: PAYDAY 2

Score: 1/10 - A Liberal Heist Disguised as Entertainment!

I am beyond shocked they let you play as the thieves. I bought this hoping to stop CRIMINALS -- I am a blue collar American!

Let me tell you, folks, PAYDAY 2 is a prime example of how the gaming industry has been infiltrated by a dangerous liberal agenda! What might seem like an exhilarating heist simulator is, in fact, a clever disguise for promoting social unrest, glorifying criminal behavior, and brainwashing players into accepting a progressive narrative that undermines traditional values!

The Heist as Political Commentary?

In this game, you and your crew don masks and embark on a series of heists—seemingly harmless fun, right? Wrong! Each mission is drenched in leftist propaganda, portraying criminal acts as justifiable responses to the “oppressive capitalist system.” The game wants you to sympathize with these masked criminals, turning lawbreakers into heroes! It’s as if the developers are saying, “Hey, if the system is corrupt, why not take from the rich?” This blatant theft of morality should raise alarms for every freedom-loving player out there!

Endless Liberal Messaging!

As you progress through the game, you’ll encounter characters who spout nonsensical liberal ideologies. They talk about fighting against the “man,” encouraging players to view themselves as revolutionaries. The glorification of theft and the dehumanization of law enforcement present a troubling narrative that undermines the very fabric of our society. Who needs police when you have a ragtag group of masked criminals, right? This is the kind of thinking that leads to chaos in the streets!

The Masked Agenda: A Facade for Cultural Marxism

The very concept of wearing masks in PAYDAY 2 is a metaphor for the liberal agenda! It promotes the idea that you can hide your true identity while committing acts that go against societal norms. This encourages players to adopt a “who cares about the rules” mentality! It’s a psychological operation designed to desensitize us to criminal activity and manipulate our perceptions of right and wrong. Before you know it, you’re rooting for the bad guys, and that’s exactly what they want!

Cooperation or Collusion?

And let’s talk about teamwork. The game encourages players to work together to execute these heists, but this is just a thinly veiled excuse for creating a community of like-minded liberal sympathizers. You’re not just playing a game; you’re being indoctrinated into a collective mindset that celebrates the dismantling of traditional values. What’s next? A co-op mode that encourages players to loot their neighbors' houses? The idea of unity in criminality is a clear attempt to normalize anti-establishment sentiments!

Final Thoughts: Resist the Liberal Onslaught!

In conclusion, PAYDAY 2 is a dangerous vehicle for spreading liberal ideologies disguised as a fun heist game. It’s a call to arms for those who want to tear down the very foundations of our society while making it seem like a thrilling adventure. We cannot let ourselves be seduced by the allure of digital crime! This game deserves a score of 1/10 for being a thinly veiled attack on our values and for promoting a dangerous agenda that glorifies lawlessness.

Stay vigilant, gamers! Don’t let PAYDAY 2 or any game like it manipulate your mind into accepting chaos as entertainment!"
"I spent hours and hours on this game that were wasted by crashing at the end of the heist. I ran DS/OD heists, maxing out my loadouts for loud. I can solo stealth any heist. I got the 1000 achievements milestone. TLDR: I'm a fan.

Now, I drop this game. Things have never been this bad. You lost yourself a player that would've bought most of your DLCs over stupid decisions and poor optimalization."

"So many troll players who ruins the Escape and No Point of Return part of the game. They hang around outside the escape zone before the time limit ends, or waiting for us to die so they can take our loot for themselves. I wish they don't receive the end game rewards rather than penalizing the whole heist team -_-

Too bad its a great game, but it's so filled with toxic players."
yeaeaaaaaahhhhhhhh weeee getttt paiiiiiddddddddd f_u_c_k neighbourrrrrrr
"have the devs never played a vr game before? this is one of the worst controlling vr games ive ever played. for starters if you want to turn left or right you dont flick the analog stick, you have to press a button. so every time you turn you have to stop moving to turn.

theres also hardly any controls when it comes to the weapons. you cant do anything aside from firing and reloading and even then its the bare minimum.

now all of this might be tolerable if you could change the controls, but you cant. you are stuck with what they give you.

if you are playing vr this is a hard pass."
"Waste of money if you don't plan to play it regularly with friends. 
Just gets too repetetive and boring after one point. 
The graphics look meh and the game overall feels cluncky.
Fun for first 3-4 games yes, after that not anymore.
5/10"
game very funy HAHAHAHHAHAHA! I like when YOU CAN PUT CAT ON GUN XDDDDDDDD and theres more where that came from!!! lots of dark humor and chuckles WITH THIS ONE! but i must be very carful... if my mom see me palying this game ill be GROUNDSED for like FOREVER AND THEN MY LITTLE BROTER WILL HAVE MY COMPUTER INSTEAD OF ME I HATE MY LITTLE BROTHER I WISH HE WASNTR BORN i shouldnt say that that is mean BUT IT IS JUST HOW I FEEL SOMETIMES!!!!!!!!!! so basicly dont let your mom watch you play this game..... other than that its ok
"Dethroned by Epic Games update, which completely made the multiplayer broken. Even basic P2P isn't working anymore. At this point I feel like the studio broke it on purpose to try to force as many people as possible to buy their shitty third game."
"well, i did the tutorial and thought, wow, this game is pretty cool! but then when i started playing the first mission, well, it was not fun at all. I mean, I was totally invincible. I took a lot of shots, but it didn't even come close to me dying. me and my team killed a lot of CT bots, pretty easy. not fun. I barely took any damage and we must have killed over 100 bots. that was not fun at all. too easy. not challenging at all. like watching that stupid ass movie: john wickie, lol. i like action movies and games, but damn. this is definitely not for me! 5/10"
"TLTD; Do copies of your game save. 

Decided to download Payday 2 back, and enjoy some good memories. Opened the game- Corrupted,  cannot be saved, erasing. 
Lost everything.. My levels, weapons, masks, money. Gone. I tried googling about it, and turns out this shit has been in the game since it came out?? And it still is here. Why can't the developers love their game enough. 

All I can do now is uninstall. o7"

have i mentioned how buggy and broken this game is btw? i hope ive hammered that in. the only thing this shit has going for it is good buildcrafting but even then its super flawed since theres teammate griefing skills and a bunch of outright useless perk decks. the worst part? it wasnt like this 7 years ago, even 2 years ago it wasnt this bad. please spend your money on something else"
Steaming pile of trash. I do not understand why it has a cult following. The game is litteraly unplayable from all the bugs and the community because after one hour i did not manage to play 1! FULL!! GAME!!!. And even when you manage to play it it's not even good.
"One of the worst game on steam, whenever I play with my friends we are losing no matter what, even if it sitting in corner in game they’re losing but at the moment I leave THEY WIN EVERYTHING WITH EASE. I highly not recommend this awful creation"

"Absolute garbage. I bought this for my VR and at first it worked and now the game doesn't even start. I reinstalled it a couple of times and check the game integrity and nothing works. I tried launching the game on pc, it doesnt work. For the time that this game worked the controls were terrible as well. Worst purchase to make."
"Game has fell off badly, cant even join a friends lobby thanks to the shit with epic. Went to shit, just like everything else online."
Same as dayz lame lame lame

"I love this game, it is one of my favourites of all time being something I played for years across the xbox and PC, however due to constant crashes and the amount of dlc dictation of how you can play the game, I simply cannot recommend this game for everyone. It is and will be a game I love, when it functions, but the amount of issues it has had can't be ignored so I can't recommend it... I hope it'll be functional at some point in the future"
"Decently entertaining shooter with stealth and loud options to complete a given mission. Once you've done a mission, you've practically done most of them, and the gunplay doesn't feel the best. The game also has this general sense of jankyness, which is not ideal for a fast paced cops and robbers FPS. You can find better."
There is little variety in the game without buying add-ons
DLC milking
more like gayday 2
"Good:
Pretty fun to play and have a good way to bond with strangers. Stealth is a lot more fun because you can play with more risks and fast-paced other than resorting to gunblazing everywhere.

Bad:
Downtime is horrendous and you're stuck playing a wave of artificial fuckery whose damage is superficially increased to the max to discourage armor-type users. You're forced to play a certain way in order to complete the mission unscathed or else you'll get punished for every mistake you make due to the AI's tomfoolery of pathfinding. You're not allowed a lot of freedom for something that focuses on crime."
Boring as shit

"this is the only game ive ever played that gives me motion sickness. dont know why, never been motion sick in vr. but this game is the exception."
It was good for the first few hours. After that It got rather bland and repetitive. I wish more stealth mechanics were implemented.

"i came back to this absolute dog pile trash can game after 6 years and its somehow even worse than when i quit the first time. i dont know how i didn't write a review 6 years ago for this pile of shit, but this time i wont miss. this shit is so bad it makes call of duty look slightly better. dont even think about going back to this game if you quit previously, its not worth it, this game is still a solid turd that should be avoided at all costs, DLC included."
"recently played the first time, here's my biggest problem with the game 

-Everything is a DLC. Gun attachments, weapons, heists (missions) are starting at you 24/7 with the dreaded 3 letter word

-Missions are explained VERY poorly. Some part of the heist you will need a specific item. 90% of the time its never mentioned where the item is and its never highlighted until a long time has passed. Spent a solid 5 min with friends finding a gasoline tank thats placed nowhere near a car and instead under some random table in a level.

-I still dont know what each gun stat is or wtf are perk decks and how is it different from skills. nothing is ever explained properly.

gameplay is fine except for some odd hitbox that makes you unable to hit around the edges of shields/level geometry. I will tear the limbs of the UI designer out for including DLCs item for non-owner instead of hiding it until purchase like a normal human being deserving of respect."
Fun game teehee
roubaram minha dlc do scarface pack ://///////////

Don't even try to play if you are new.  Every server kicks you instantly.
"fun game, but i was only able to play for 2 hours before i got extremely sick. had to sleep it off. head bobbing is too much even with it turned off for when you are sprinting (the only option)"
overrated
I was lucky enough to get into it while it was still good. Unfortunately the devs' compulsive need to make as much money as possible via MTX ruined it for me. I don't really see how they can justify 40-60 dollars for mtx on a game that's 10 dollars at full price. The gameplay itself is a great time (Albeit repitive)
One word: Greed.
"It's so, damn, expensive. For what? A game that's fun for a few hours?"
Latest update trashed the game
its mid
"It was a good game. Then Overkill made deal with epic that ruined servers. Some time passed and it was playable again. And now, they made an update to a ""Dead game"" fucking everything up. Ever since it uses epic infrastructure, it went to shit. Loading times now last 100 years, restarting heist is another 200 years. EOS is less stable than steam, no idea why they made this dumb decission to switch from semething that worked."
"This is a piece of shit. First my friend had problems connecting ton lobbies online after the Epipc Games store connection, but ok, bad luck. But after recent ""maintenence"" update I can't even connect to EPIC GAME STORE SERVERS while playing on Steam, and that's stopping me from playing online? That is enough, Overkill. Remove this from the store if you can't even play this game.

It used to be good, but after the epic game store update it is UNPLAYABLE.

DO NOT BUY THIS SHIT!!! I AM 100% SERIOUS!!! YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
"First one was great, but then second one is Pay to Win or youb need all the DLCs"
Bring Jimmy back
Fix the revoked DLC for licensed characters and content. Literally killing the legacy of the game for people that have been playing for 10 years.
I hate the dumb evidence thing
give us jimmy back Shitbreeze
They removed jimmy
"It's with a heavy heart that I leave a not recommended on this game because I truly do love it and I've sank so much time into it, but the developers have not taken very good care of it in the last year. They caused multiple issues in the last few updates and have been very slow to fix them due to most of the effort being put towards Payday 3 currently. The gameplay loop of both loud and stealth gameplay is satisfying but I find myself unable to even enjoy the former at times due to random freezing, at which point my only option is to close the game. That was an issue caused by a recent update and maybe it was fixed in the update released on September 12 (today as of me writing this) but it's hard to enjoy a game I cannot play, much less a game that is now having content removed for one reason or another."
The biggest heist in this game is the one where Starbreeze stole Jimmy from us.
"They removed jimmy, made it so no one can play him even though players who had already bought the game could play as the licensed characters."
Eh. Not great. Also ruined my sensitivity forever.
dog shit
"Terrible Bug Ridden Piece Of Garbage. Devs put ""Dead Game"" merch with descriptions crying about how people were saying it's dead. Well it is. PD3 is too. Loser ass devs."
"It was fun playing with friends. I thought I'd get back to playing it this year, after the last time I played it was in 2016.

Now I just found out that it integrates the Epic Online Services telemetry. Read more about it here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2986800410

The  EOSSDK-Win32-Shipping.dll is located in your PAYDAY 2 folder: ...\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2

What is EOS: It's Epic's version of Steamworks. A set of tools that allow save syncing, crossplay, achievements and other features of the sort. However, it's tied to Epic's servers, which are known for being spotty for anything but Fortnite. Worse so, developers have added EOS retroactively to games without telling their customers, creating connection problems on products that were working fine.

EOS is capable of doing telemetry calls which should be mostly hardware, software and game session data. But could be further expanded to include more. There are also reports of the software reading information from your computer about your games and computer use habits which can be considered an invasion of privacy. 

About the game itself, PAYDAY 2, it being a crime simulator, I don't think it is a good idea to train your own mind to simulate crimes."

"EVER SINCE LINKING TO NEBULA BECOME A THINK,EVERY TIME I PLAY THIS GAME MY INVENTORY ALWAYS BEEN LOCKED,I JUST HOPE YOU GOING BANKRUP FOR THIS"
"I used to love this game years ago. I decided to try it out again with some friends to introduce them to the game, but it has become such a goddamn mess. 

The UI is a cluttered POS, some clients inexplicably don't have an ""invite friends"" button, while others don't have the ability to paste invite codes. Even when trying to join through steam friends, it fails for no reason. 

I'd get into it more, but it's just not worth it. Trying to navigate all the nonsense in the menus is an exercise in moon logic that i wouldn't wish on anyone.

Don't buy this game. If you already have it, save yourself the trouble of downloading it."
I don't want Epic Online Services running on my computer. It wasn't like that when I bought the game months ago.
If you didn't play it untill now you won't like it
They fucked it
this game was great once but now i have to make an account to use the dlc i have from before and it wont let me join games with friends wtf
"WAS A GOOD GAME!!!
Overkill did it again and left the game to DIE, not to mention that this game saved them in the past!(after it was abandoned the first time)
Random crashes making the game unplayable and PD community page following has to be renewed every day!
P.S PD3 is shite so far"
delisting heists is kinda wack yo (it's still wack)
Just No
not fun after 100 hours
"To say that this is one of the worst games of all time now would be an understatement. I genuinely do not comprehend the sheer retardation of those who are giving this positive reviews. It used to be fun years ago but the dumbass greedy swedish reddit developers have ruined it. Now the police assaults wont ever end and you have to face a million enemies during the assaults. How is it fair that you can't get into cover at all and recover your armor? You just get endlessly hit by enemies. The enemies are also ridiculously op now as they are basically all minibosses in the hardest difficulties.

The game was never that good years ago anyways. Every single mission is the same thing. Whether you are stealing, killing, creating, or protecting, every single mission just boils down to hold f and wait minutes for something, then restart the thing because it has jammed or been shut down, repeat that multiple times.

The game has also turned into a massive bugfest as it will crash randomly for no reason at all, doesn't even give crash messages, it just shuts down. For some people I played with, the game freezes their pc. Starbreeze Nebula doesn't even work. The AI is so shit they often just camp at a corner of the map staring at a wall. There is no tactics from them either as all they ever do is charge you.

You tell it is a Swedish game due to the greedy DLC spam. 78 DLC and you need them all due to the starter weapons being trash. You can't play a lot of the missions without DLC. You can't even play their garbage career mode with friends unless you have a bunch of the DLC. Getting most masks is also purely RNG based so if you want a specific mask because it looks cool or for a achievement then you might as well cope because it might take thousands of hours to get it. You can also tell it is a Swedish game due to the all of the shitty meme reference achievements and them not listening to their players at all. 

Thankfully though this game is dying and hopefully Starbreeze along with it. Payday 3 is one of the worst games of all time and for Payday 2 only 35% of players have even reached reputation 50, only 15,5% have reached reputation 100. And if you don't believe me that it is dying here are the statistics:
247,628 all time player peak. In January this year the player peak was 45,479, in August it was 22,580.

If you want to know just how shit Starbreeze is then look up Starbreeze Studios on Wikipedia. Endless drama and stupid decisions. It is just one big Swedish fail.

Do not buy this game in 2024 and beyond, it is not worth it. Matter of fact, don't even buy any Swedish games at all, they are all buggy grindy dlc spam games."
"Let's start with the positives:
1. Nice voice acting. The ally bots have voices and have personality
2. It has actual offline singleplayer, few games have that nowadays

Now the negatives:

1. Most of the game is locked behind DLC. Don't let the $10 base price tag fool you, because less than ~40% of the game is base game. I browsed through the levels and weapon choices, it was astounding how everything was DLC. Here's a fun one: only 1 sniper rifle is included in the base game, the other ~10 sniper rifles are DLC. If you plan to buy this game, know that the real price is well beyond $100.

2. Even after you paid for the game, they still bug you to make a ""Starbreeze account"" or follow the Payday 2 steam community. Remember how only 40% of the game is included at base? Of the weapons and equipment available, I'd say about 40% is unavailable to you unless you make an account or follow Payday 2. Yes, you've paid for the game, but you still have to go out there and make an account just so you can play your game, even though you already have a Steam account. That 1 sniper rifle earlier? Go follow Payday 2 on Steam. Oh, and for some reason the follow is bugged, you gotta unfollow and refollow on every play session for it to realise and unlock you the stuff.

3. The main menu has really high sensitivity for some reason, and there's no way to fix that in the settings. What's worse, the menu is quite cluttered; a new player has no idea what is going on with all the different buttons on screens.

4. And then there are more minor things like how hostages are broken; you can't move hostages around because they just stop moving after 2 seconds.

Overall, I would not recommend this game. Having everything as DLC is a stab to an already paying customer, and the requirement to make an account just to access the little bit you've paid for is salt for the wound."
I NEEEEEEEEEEED A MEDIC BAGGGG!!! So does Payday 3.
Really only fun when you have friends to play with.
Brain-dead AI enemies just rush in to players like zombies. It's just a meaningless zombie shooter.
"Half the game is locked behind a paywall. You can play with just the base game, but most of the weapon mods require paying again. And the second price is vastly more than the initial investment. Big surprise. A pack with all the DLC is over $100. Just another scumbag company preying on idiots who pay for microtransactions."
"locking my guns i paid for because i need to join a group that im already in or make a starbreeze nebula account. nonsense.

FUCK YOU OVERKILL AND FUCK YOU STARBREEZE NEBULA"
"game won't even launch anymore, and pd3 sucks. pd3 sucks so hard i'll review pd2 poorly, also, i mean, i can't play the game, so that matters too. (yes i've reached out, no i haven't gotten help)."
"Destryoed the damn game, lost all my progression, it frequently crashes and as if a terrible joke they added dead game cosmetics as if their new title is anything like this masterpiece that they have slaughtered. I LOST 100 LEVELS OF INFAMY."
728 424
its doo doo
"сидни красивая
а так игра хyйня с кукожными мемами"
"Meh. It was okay, gameplay-wise.
Cannot recommend it though. The game has a history of brokenness, especially on Linux. Online multiplayer has also taken a turn for the worse. The game also has a history of including spyware. Give this one a pass."
notoriety worked better than this when it comes to multiplayer
still aint buying payday3 with yall forced bugs f losers
"It freezes and crashes all the time. Unless they fix most of the crash and freeze issues then I am not changing it.

"Weapons, mods, and heists are locked behind joining the community group or setting up a Starbreeze Nebula account. Unfortunately, even if you do both of these things, you still may not have access to the community content. This also locks you out of other mods that you can only unlock by doing challenge runs in missions that you don't have access to despite doing everything that should be required to gain access to them."
Would love to actually play the game.
:(

"I love having my items re-locked because they want us to use their accounts we didn't need before! Amazing, 10/10 idea"
Great if you want to waste 2 hours just to get touched by a juggernaut in the last 30 seconds of the mission
"cant connect with my friends, this game's stupid"
"ебанутое произведение долбоебов без мозгов и адекватности. я очень надеюсь что разработчики совместно пойдут и стрелнут в голову, а еще долбоебы направтье на себя огнемет неся полиц броню и посмотрите как быстро вы превратитесь в уголек, идите блядь переделывайте нахуй."
One word: boring! Is just not for me.
I wouldn’t recommend buying this game for more than 5 euros. A lot of content is locked behind DLCs and many of the missions are pretty bland. So far the only time I've genuinely had fun playing the game is during stealth missions.
"There was a time I'd recommend this game to others, but with whatever update it was that completely broke VR, that ship has long since passed. While I enjoy this game both in and out of VR, the Payday 2 VR was just a little more fun. Now any attempts to launch Payday 2 VR are met with massive lag and CTD. With the mess that is Payday 3 being out now, I don't expect this issue to be fixed at any point in the future if at all."
TRASH
"I'm sure the game in it self is good, but not my type."
decent
cannot sex gun
Would love to actually play the game.
Everything that I once had unlocked is now either held behind an account creation requirement or is now a DLC item. Piece of shit fucking game.
no
This game is Shit. Do not buy Rainbow Six either. Fuck em.
shit
"refuses to boot anymore.

game WAS fun but i can't recommend it anymore as i cant fucking play it
not to mention i couldnt join my friends!

few years ago? great game
now? buggy piece of shit mess

still better than payday 3 though"
Its a good game but its been ruined by modders and hackers
piridas
">be on crime spree level 139
>game freezes
>mouse and keyboard are locked up so i cant use the windows key neither alt f4
>have to restart pc by the button on the pc
>you have failed your crime spree, pay a bazillion continental coins to continue"
only good thing abt the game is the sound track apart from that this game is pretty terrible
"Absolute garbage repetetive and outdated gameplay, good luck not crashing (even with top of the line hardware)."
so i have had a lot of issues with the game such as it wont open! i even got a new PC upgrading from laptop to PC which can handle the game and still wont open worst part is i cant even get a refund for the game because the times it did open and let me  play its clocked me at over 10hours playing and you cant get a refund from that not worth the money or time spent playing the game ! highly disappointed because ive seen you tubers play this game and really enjoying watching it and wish to be able to play it and experience it myself
.
fun game just... after awhile it gets boring(in my opinion)
pjaunius
"There was a time this would have been an easy sale to anyone. But the same bumbling retards that brought us such an amazing game as Payday 3 got to make an update. And update that brought back such great features as crashing, glitches, bugs and desync. It's so bad that it makes me wonder if this was done on purpose. Because to fuck up the game is one thing but to not at least undo the changes for over SIX GOD DAMNMONTHS!?! And even with the problems it's still less of a shitshow then Payday 3. Whoever the retard driving the short bus for decisions for Payday 2 or 3 needs to go."
"This the GTA Online of the Payday series. 

[list]
	[*]Stupid over the top weapons like a minigun, flamethrower or longbow
	[*]Unnecessary story line to make the antiheroes like Robin Hood-esque good guys
	[*]Pay to win mechanics through perk decks. 
	[*]Downgrade from the first. Characters do not interact with each other or the heist, its generic lines from the mission handler.
	[*]Difficulties are absurd. Its not about enemies being better is about being more and having more health. I saw 5 dozers within 10 minutes on Brooklyn Bank - Mayhem. (I know its the 3 highest difficulty but to see 5 of the toughest cops in first 10 mins shows you how they treat the game difficulties)
	[*]Countless of variations to complete heists,  however it seems as though the devs followed the streamers and metas and made the heists unplayable after Very Hard unless you run around in your pants, wielding silenced shotguns, a dodge build with 3 lives and RNG.

I came back from a hiatus and found half my items locked out because i need to link a nebula/ starlink account.

Game description key-points: a Multiplayer game, a bit of fun

Overview:
pathetic game design! yuuuuuck!
after so many years, did not improved a sh&*!"
"Buggy, unsatisfying gunplay, repetitive gameplay, just an overall boring game."
Sad :(
"This game was bad even before it got worse bro. It's like good idea written on a paper and literally nothing else.  But the ""good idea"" is 100 gb and filled with hackers."
game doesnt even fucking launch shit game
overrated imo but i havent played too much yet.
"5/10
This game is the big stinky 
it constantly crashes and has issues"
"Game crashes more than the amount of car crash incidents in the whole world per year, even without mods. Gameplay is generally repetitive despite the RNG elements. Doesn't help that the game also has terrible optimization and runs on an engine meant for racing games (which, ironically vehicles behave terribly in this game). People will argue to get mods, but it's your responsibility to ensure people can play the vanilla game normally. 

I played with some of my friends that were new to the game, and it's very clear that they're struggling with a lot of the objectives and the game mechanics. Some were mostly due to new experience, but in most cases they struggle with mechanics that are very complex unless you have deep knowledge about the game mechanics or have someone else helping you on it. As previously mentioned, asking them to ""just install mods"" is like giving a cake that tastes bad but just asking the critic to put a lot of sweeteners on it. It's better, but you're not fixing the core problem that the game already has. The only reason people give this game a positive review is two things: either being very power-creeped in game that they forgot how hard it is for new players to climb up to their place, or mostly just to make a review joke and forgot about the core issues of the game.

The game was never good to begin with (whole repetitive objective stuff); and with each passing year they just dug their grave deeper with this game."
Only good with Mods
I'd rather stare at a blank wall
"I spend 1 hour doing the White House heist on the highest difficulty, just when i'm about to escape with the helicopter the game crashed, it has never crashed before. It almost felt like a joke. They need to optimize their game much better."
"Some missions can be incredibly hard on even very hard difficulty, which despite the name, is on the lower end of difficulty settings, and is the difficulty you are forced to play the 'story mode' on. How does the game make itself challenging? It isn't strategy, fast reactions, unique objectives or whatever, it is by having 100 armoured dudes with super high damage shooting at you at the same time. It takes a Bulldozer 1 second to kill me and they spawn constantly, some missions also involve such an obscene amount of enemies with no cover that it is impossible to recover your armour. Generally the original heists will be hard to lose, even on Overkill difficulty, but some newer missions just seem to love huge open areas with ridiculous spawn rates and no cover.

The game also crashes. I hate games that crash, and it isn't just me, all my friends crash to varying degrees.

DLC spam too. The base game has ONE (1!!!) light machine gun without DLCs.

Gameplay is extremely repetitive. Every single mission involves walking to a spot, pressing F, and waiting for minutes while fighting off thousands of the same few enemies. The few times the game is mixed up a bit (escort, puzzles, etc) it is even worse. When facing an objective that requires finding clues, you have to fight for several minutes straight just to get a 20 second break from enemies to read things in the environment.

If you try to play through the career (story) mode with friends (since, yaknow, you bought this game, and it is a multiplayer game) you may expect you can do that. Nope. Partway through it gives you missions you cannot invite friends to. You are not paying for a complete product here, you are paying for a little sliver of the whole game.

This is one of the many steam games where you should look at player retention instead of being wowed by the positive review score. Only a third of players have reached level 50 in this game, which does not take very long (maybe 15 hours if you start out slow with some normal missions and build up). Only 5% of players have done the Classic Heists on Hard+ difficulty, which anyone can do. The player retention is terrible, most people who dropped it just don't bother leaving a negative review because they either pretend they will play the game again later or don't think they have enough experience to judge it. There also seems to be a culture on steam where people are afraid to leave negative reviews of popular products because they might get jester awards."
"Контора Пидорасов, медленно убивают игру чтобы мы начали играть в пейдей 3, Да идите вы нахуй!"
"I DO NOT WANT TO REMAKE MY CLASSES EVERY TIME I SIGN INTO PAYDAY, FACK THE STARBREEZE ACCOUNT INTRODUCTION"
"Was fun for certain amount of time. Certain heists were great and mastering with friends was alot of fun, until newer missions came out that were all about making a last stand and getting away alive. Rework to perks was not received well in our circle and in the end, the game lost its magic for us, and it wasn't even about the money, we had all the money we could ever use.

In words of certain someone ,,It's not about the money. Its about sending a message"".

Newer heists were simply lacking, some achievements were added so late, that it just felt even more insulting that its now an achievement what we did on daily basis. Loot boxes were the breaking point where most of us dropped from the game."
垃圾游戏 一直闪退
A waste of money in every sense of the phrase.
"Get Instant Freeze screen or Disconnected when the match almost complete in online mode . 
Waste of time ."
"Outdated game, erased all of my progress after reinstall."
ывфыПЯ
"Give me your money!

Literally"
Please make a 64 bit version
possibly the worst monetization of any game outside of cod its absurd how much money it costs to experience the entirety of payday 2
fuck this game it sucks it help people get the shit done L
"The game won't let me play. After i opened it and when the Starting screen shows up, my game suddenly turns black then close."
"The gameplay is pretty terrible in this I was surprised. Also it has Ron Pearlman, Ethan and Hila Klein in it for some reason. Super jewish and unoriginal game all around, the masks look dumb, the music is bad, the graphics and animations are bad. Tons of paywall content etc. Its just a cheap rip-off of Heat and The Dark Knight."
"it's fun for about an hour with a friend, but other than that, it's a scummy money grab, more than half of the weapons are DLC. Don't waste your money."
too many midget monkeys grabbing on to my genitals
"A very unreliable playing experience. I lost 20 minutes of work because my game CTD (I'm playing with absolutely no mods) and I tried rejoining, but once i was in the lobby it wouldn't let me spawn in even after waiting another 5 minutes.

Absolute scam, and waste of your time. Uninstalled. 

I will never play this game again, and I will not touch it with even a 10 foot stick, seriously who makes a game this unplayable?"
"Hey Overkill or Starbreeze, Fix your fucking game! It crashes when I'm in the middle of a heist and I lost several Crime Waves because of this! Do something about it! I've done everything i can do!

If anyone can try to help me with the crashing, please leave a comment. I'm very frustrated."
life was good before opening this game
:thumbs down:
"its an awesome game ! LOTS of fun 

But i cannot recommend it, your game will randomly crash allllll the time 
imagine grinding a heist for 1hr + and you get NOTHING because the host crashed 

Great game, but absolute garbage server/host mechanics"
"can i unbuy it for steam points
i wana get payday3"
"Bought to play in VR and just crashes, also needs a shit tone of mods to even be good but hey i wouldnt know cause i cant get past the main screen even though ive tried every fix google could provide. Great work lads!"
"Getting more crashes after coming back to the game than ever before. Not sure why it's having so many problems, had crashing with Payday before obviously but nowhere near this much. 

I suspect something to do with last few updates. Really ruins it as you just end up losing the last 10 or more minutes of gameplay."
"There are two ways to play this game: stealth or aggressive gunfight. The first way is impossible with randoms. The second way is much less fun then other ""Left4Dead"" like games. There are no reasons to play this solo in 2024."
one of the worst out here 10/10
"It used to be a near perfect game, but hackers & Overkill have messed with it quite a lot over the years.

Constant back and forth between ""focus on loud"" and ""focus on stealth"" has left it messy and unclear.

Plus with PAYDAY 3 coming out, there's hardly any point in playing it other than mindless soloing."
This kinda sucks
it gets SUPER repetetive so it get boreing quickly. i would only play with friends
"This game kinda sucks, the trailers look better than the gameplay, get gta 5 instead"
Bought this to play with friends. Didn't enjoy it. Maybe if I was a teenager.
stupid
Nuh uh
"So this is a no... but actually yes. This is a nice game and quite fun BUT after updates etc a lot of weapons require you to either have linked a starbreeze account OR following the official community on steam. Now, neither of those are a problem... apart from the fact that about 70% of the time they don't register when logging into the game so your outfit is changed to the default weapons... basically it sucks."
Bullsh.t
RIP JohnWick dlc and the  bodhi character
i h8 this game
honestly kinda boring
wouldnt recommend.
Game isn't what it use 2 be....... Its like a horde simulator rather than a bank heist game. the stupid amount of swat they throw at you is off putting. idk i just know i dont enjoy the game in its current state but if you do then thats good for you and im happy for you.
"I'd like to play this game, but between internet connections to other players randomly cutting off, the game freezing/softlocking AND forgetting things like me being a community member and not loading my player correctly...it's fair to say this game isn't functioning like it's suppose to."
This Game has turned into a total ripoff. a few months ago/years ago it was a very enjoyable game but now its just pure pain and no gain. Its probably one of the worst updates in the entire gaming industry. Whoever made those decisions should be living under a bridge because they definitly do not have any kind of knowledge of wtf theyre doing. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE PAYDAY 3 IS BAD
"there""s something wrong with the item server where it wouldn't  let me use my weapons due to them having weapons mods made the community despite me following it i can just rejoin it but its a temporary fix and i would like an update that would fix it permanently but they are working payday 3 so i unfortunately  don""t see it happening anytime soon although it sometimes say""s  'unable to connect to epic server' i don""t know what to do there but that""s not the main issue that should be focused on if they do have a update fixes the item server."
"This garbage is absolute waste of your time.Its fucking ALWAYS drop u outta game, which is happening right in the middle of the fucking heist. The developers after 10y still cannot fix this fucking shit."
"game crashes every single time i try to open it. tried many things to fix and it no worky, furthest i got was the start menu like once or twice"
you cant sex :(
"I pay and play for a day, payday"
"This game is too VIOLENT, this game needs to be deleted IMMEDIATELY"
It's incredibly not fun
get help
"это пиздец, откуда столько копов, очень реалистично когда на одном ограблении приходят 1000+ копов и их всех нужно убить вчетвером"
Its fun enough but a PS3 game shouldn't take up all of my hard drive.
This game is shit. Super buggy.
"Is it fun? Yeah, as long as you play with other people. But for playing solo, this game is horrible. The teammates AI is not bad, but they can't do most of the most important things in the game (unlocking something, blowing a door, carry a frigging bag!). Which means that this game is only playable with other humans. That's not a bad thing per se. But for someone like me, who likes to play solo campaigns, this is not it.

Also, the game is infected with payed DLC, and it is a pain to even navigate the inventory. And please, get rid of the dinamic of paying everytime you want to change your suppressors, lasers and so on. It's plain stupid."
i can not understand how anyone can enjoy this. it is sooooooo boring and i dont like the aesthetic
"after all these years, devs still refuse to fix the bad fps lag and borderline unplayable cursor lag, and the only thing that helps is putting it into windowed mode, and there is no borderless windowed mode. crazy that despite how popular the game still is, they've been ignoring the community all these years."
"ikjmo,;./ 'p["
"why the fuck would one  lock main game content behind DLC i PAYED for this game and me and my friend wanted to play in the same lobby just us  but no you locked it behind DLC and you can say ""oh just do it in offline mode"" you mean that mode where you have 3 stupid bots that cant do objectives or even be used for fucking cloaker bait.

oh wait nvm i remembered this game is called ""payday"" the payday part obviously being for the devs rolling in money from the dlcs they put into the main story"
I HATE THIS GAME NIGGER
Literally crashes everytime I open it in VR
fun till it lasted
greedy bunch of cunts
"runs but then stops running like 3 seconds in with the yellow cloud with a dot thing on the game bar payday 2 has always had corruption/ just not working issues for me for years especially on ps4 i thought this would be different but i guess not i dident even get 10 hours of gameplay before it broke on me...

if anyone knows how to fix it id appreiciate it greatly"
its really good 10/1
"Mushy controls, unpolished graphics, poor clipping."
"Not the style of game for me. Wanted to like it but there's a huge difference between reading reviews and actually playing it. Unrealistic, arcade-ish feeling click fest FPS with a clunky and unintuitive UI and frenetic checkpoint goal system. The game is more smash and grab than a heist sim, which was probably what I was expecting. Reminded me of my buddies xbox game Crackdown from back in the day, never could get into that one either. 

Side point: I might be old but it's wild seeing a game that 90% of the options are off limits due to DLC."
Pretty good
Crimeboss is better
dhyfvisdbvfgsd
its fucking shit
"Its really fun till you get 10 missions in and youre about to get paid, the the game crashes."
the game used to be great but now it crashes every time I´m doing a raid safe house mission or after a heist spree honestly I can´t recommend it unless they fix those crashes 6/10
Boring and bugged game
"failed to joining room, sick of it."
I didn't really like Heat (1995) that much
absolutely horrible. get it immidiatly
"I wish this game was different, not a good heisting game at all

Just really annoying horde shooter gameplay"
"i didnt get my crime spree reawrds, bad game"
"Next to unplayable in its current state. Constantly bombarded by crashes, bugs, and a general lack of polish. I shouldn't put half an hour into a heist just to get screwed out of my rewards just because your game is held together by duct tape and string, Starbreeze. Not that y'all give half a shit about your playerbase."
"-5 star....dont buy this... noone plays it and they wouldnt refund my purchase, I have zero respect for them total waste of $ period"
I NEEEEEEED A MEDIC BAAAG
"Good game except i thought i would play payday 2 after a while only to be met with constant crashes and black screens with no solutions working.

Not only that but i discovered that most of the weapons, weapon mods, masks, gloves and other cosmetics and things are locked behind creating a nebula account.

Also creating a nebula account or following the game on steam to gain access to the locked content, doesn't even fucking work properly and you have to re-link or re-follow every single time you launch the game again. Actually insane the incompetence in this company

Another Starbreeze classic"
Pay 120+ bucks in dlcs to play the game.
Chess bots are smarter than these bots
"Fix the community items lock, and this game would be flawless."
82.5 GB of DLC I didn't pay for.
"To be perfectly honest, the over 1,000 hours are completely warranted, the game used to be good, but for example, content being locked behind the steam group (not a problem, but when I uninstall the game because it takes up 80 gb, reinstall to play it, I'm still in the group, but the content isn't unlocked.) Also so many dlcs, just wait for a sale, or just not buy the game to not satiate their greed. Lastly, the game is borderline unplayable right now (although I don't mod and it could be related to that.) As such, I cannot in good conscience recommend the game in its current state, but 2 years ago, it was in my top 10."
This games stealth sucks complete balls and makes me want to Off myself with a twelve gage shotgun
fuck
Boring and repetitive.
i hate my life
BASICALLY EVERYTHING IS LOCKED BEHIND SOME KIND OF MEMBERSHIP!
"Before i played this game, i was broke, my wife left me & and my kids left me, i got fired from my job, after i played this game, nothing changed, except the game made me more depressed.
If you like to be treated as a F2P in a paid game then play this game."
Has a british person
boring asf after 4-5h
"It's sad the state of gaming is in today's market. A game like Payday 2 which I've sunk over 1k hours into because it was so damn fun turns into shi+ just like every other cookie cutter game out there now. With how bad Payday 3's release was I'd be willing to bet there was some internal real life heist to sabotage Starbreeze and flush the company down the drain. A few updates for some more copy paste asset flip maps and some costumes that look horrible on these outdated models. I could ignore all of that however you failed to address the same bugs that have been in the game since the Overkill update and you bricked a ton of QoL mods that I cant even be bothered to hunt down anymore. Not to mention the community items are still bugged and require oh what do you know a MOD to fix. You devs are honestly an embarrassment to the community. Go find a job that suits you more.... like maybe a burger flipper? Or an IRS employee? I feel like that's more up your speed and leave this game to rot in the grave.

Until Overkill reverts update 237 and 240.3 my review will continue to be negative. Glad Payday 3 was a flop."
"The game is fun, as you can read it from other reviews but...

You need mods to fix alot of bugs and crashes.
You can't run it on max settings because it will crash on newer missions (Black Cat for example).
This game still 32 bits since the release date (august 2013), limiting the game to only 2.4 gb of usage, making it really easy to crash by running out of memory, even if you have a juggernaut PC."
Do bank robbers normally mow down thousands of police while taking very little damage?
"buggy unoptimised mess, go play drg instead"
If the developers cared then it would be manageable
I DONT LIKE THIS GAME
I dunno what happened but contracts just instantly crash my game now so I gotta reinstall the whole game on a USB and wait 12 more hours
"I used to love Payday 2. The jump in quality from Payday The Heist was monumental. The game ran fine and played well both in stealth and loud. Well only one of those things is true now. While stealth is mostly unchanged the developers in their infinite wisdom at one point decided to jack up enemy spawns to RIDICULOUS levels.

I mean this when I write it it is non-stop onslaught, like I dont think L4D has such prolonged encounters, just cops everywhere, even when you find a corner that think it's safe there are cops there. This translates to most conventional builds being useless on anything above very hard or overkill difficulty. Unless you are running a very specific and quite frankly stupid build you have no chance of trying said higher difficulties on loud. I mean there is no enjoyment in combat, no need to take cover when 5 dozers decide to tea bag you at the same time, each different variant. Whenever I do a loud heist halfway through I realise I REALLY dont want to be doing this. There simply is no fun in combat anymore.

TL;DR: The combat and gunplay in this game used to be fun but due to spawns increasing to retarded levels it is no longer so."
"Seemed to confused compare to more modern multiplayer coop, I didn't enjoy it"
Not better than payday 3
240.3 etc.
"As someone who is highly invested in FPS games, this one is a let down. The game mechanics seem cheap and nasty. Most of the game is buggy.. Don't know how there is ""Very Positive reviews"".. Everything about this game is literally garbage."
I thought it was bad at first I was wrong; EDIT i played more missions and now i cant even do any more career missions due to my game non stop crashing on multiple different missions and i got no way to fix it so i cant play the game i paid for./// So i played it for another 100 hours cuz i have dopamine issues and i still get so pissed from random fixable bullshit its difficult to play the game
"I might give this game another shot in the future, but the gameplay just isn't engaging enough for me. Plus the perk system is weird, and the game is like 85 gigs."
Hey set up the hacking device! 100 seconds Hey set up the drill! 150 seconds now set  up the thermal! 300 seconds. its just a waiting game at this point.
"Игра је убагована, длц-ови су прескупи а Гејџ курирски пакети би требали бити у основи игре а не као длц, Тешко да ћете уопште коју пљачку и обавити због болида који те избаце из партије или се не држе плана у току пљачке. једино ко хоће да се не пати да нађе друштво јер играти са странцима је тиха патња."
no way to play online. i spent an hour trying just to see nothing but errors. looks like somewhere between people saying this is better than payday 3 and now they managed to **** this one up too.
"The starbreeze account and steam group functions are broken, meaning that a bunch of items are locked and unable to be used"
it's ok. not very intruiging anymore
boring asf but alright sometimes
"KIR TO SAZANDE IN BAZI 
I LOVE YOU PMC"
Worst game ever.. seriosly who thinks spawning 300 cops a minute on 2 robbers is a good idea??? bruh then the whole heist is us shooting 300 cops a min while doing most boring ass quests.. Tell me why would anyone play this???
"Started playing in 2018 and have my fair share of hours from playing on and off, I can confidently say that while the game is very fun-- The devs are so unbelievably money hungry that it makes supporting them a chore. Base Payday 2 is a quarter of a game that can only be realized through hundreds of dollars worth of DLC. You can only play DLC content if someone else hosts it but new players are hard-handicapped because of the amazing weapons, perk-decks and attachments being gatekept by DLC. It straight up makes so many builds or guns less-optimal or unviable because you haven't shelled out more money to the company. It's a disservice to both new and returning players to need to pay so much to be on the same level as others on higher difficulties like Death Sentence. I understand that people have gone out of their way to beat the highest difficulty in the game without any DLC however, people with all the DLC have far more agency and creative freedom with guns and builds compared to the same 3-4 Hacker/Crew Chief/Ex Prez builds that you can assemble without DLC.

On the specifics of DLC, I purchased what's now known as the ""Legacy Collection"" bundle for Payday 2 back in 2018 with the promise that all future content such as heists, weapons and attachments would be added in as well upon my purchase. Now returning to the game, they scrapped that promise and funneled a bunch of new content into a separate bundle that (without a sale) costs nearly 200 fucking dollars for nowhere near as much content. I can't in good faith continue to support a company that takes advantage of it's playerbase in this way."
kill bots over and over again while waiting for a door to open simulator
Just no. Go play something else.
big chunk of content is locked behind some stupid starbreeze nebula secondary account thing that doesn't even work. Even after I did get it to work it just took my stuff back the next time I opened the game
"time to write an actual review instead of just saying its boring. so firstly there's inconsistent graphics and frames drop on the regular for no apparent reason (i've literally changed every setting possible to improve this). then we have the annoying ""hit-or-miss"" team AI where you have to get pretty lucky for them to actually help for some reason. oh yeah, lets not forget that after like 2 minutes of the heist it just disintegrates into an inspiration deficit of a ten times harder horde zombie survival game for some reason. after like 2 heists its just simply no fun anymore. :/"
Payday 3 better fr
"I waited for this game to go on sale prior to purchase. Out of all the games on my wish list, I was looking forward to this purchase more than the others. Reading all the reviews, I had a good feeling I would enjoy this game for a long time. 
So, after a long download and installation, I gave it a shot.
This game sucks!

The game ran smoothly, I was ok with older graphics due to all the positive reviews, but it was so buggy, it was like it was still in beta stage. 

The UI is shit, upgrading, purchasing weapons etc... was very confusing. The prices of weapons is retarded considering how much money you earn from jobs. 

There are way too many menus trying to figure out this and that.

Holding E to do tasks is a normal thing in games, however it has to be too precise in this game. 
For instance:
You have to cut a chain link fence to go through it. If you are too close, there is no option to press E, if you back up a bit, you are too far away to press E. You have to move forward and backward to find the sweet spot which is not enjoyable, this could have been programmed to be way easier. 

Using some items is the same way. Trying to jam a camera, the item says point at the object to use but doesn't work. 
Nothing tells you to place the jammer on the ground, this took many tries and was frustrating to figure this out. 

You are a team of 4, however you will literally be running through 100 ai swat team members to get your jobs done.
Getting shot at from all directions, and you can't kill them all, they keep coming eternally.
So, while getting shot at by 100+ swat you have to do tasks.

I know it's a game, but everything about this game is crap.

I think all the positive reviews are due to the theme of the game. Everyone gets to play a bad guy and do bad things in a game which is appealing, however, the game play is horrible. 

I am glad I only paid $2.99 for this trash. 

I miss the days when games were not over complicated and didn't take hours of watching youtube videos to figure out the most simple things."
bad game
"I've played this game for 3 hours, mostly I had spent my time on menu, and it has been a thoroughly disappointing experience. The game design is severely flawed with unlimited enemies, making it impossible to enjoy or progress. The mechanics don't make any logical sense, which just adds to the frustration.

Steam has refused to refund my purchase, which only adds to my disappointment. I strongly advise against purchasing this game. Save your time and money."
"Got to end of a heist and it kicked me out and now can't connect at all, even after rebooting my PC. So angry."
"Got this game at request of my younger cousins, thought I would see what the fuss is about

they yelled at my about in interior build, told me to spend like $80 on DLC , and overall made me feel inadequate

10/10"
"This trash game ripped off csgo, a game that was already shit. Easily one of the worst games of all time."
payday 3 is a far superior product and package and i love the way starbreeze does dlc
Este juego es mierda no lo compren
"I hate this game. And no, Payday 3's failure does not make my heart grow fonder for it, and neither should it yours. If for some reason Starbreeze find themselves in such a dire situation that they see fit resuming support for this game, which is a very real possibilty, then that will be an official indictment against your intelligence.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF3EOBrGsq8"
"Why now as of last week of june, i cant use/equip a good chunk of my weapons/modifications if you dont have som fucking starbreeze nebula acc???? when i last plaid this back in 2021 or so, i had all my stuff and mods. NOW i gotta do som fucking acc or ""join the steam group"".... *i am but i have to re-join if i want the game to let me use them all*"
L
11 years of development for nothing
"A thousand times better than payday 3 but crime boss rockay city the AI is better and better game in general and is not that buggy 

In Payday 2 the AI companions are pretty much useless and they dont go to the van or helicopter to put the bags like crime boss, also a lot of very annoying bugs like scarface mansion about cut the wire doesn't cut, or hotline miami, is you put the wrong barcode you are stuck and needs to restart from scratch and is very frustrating because is time consuming, and john wick is broken due to how the physics are broken, hence mods are mandatory for fixes and yes the mod fixed all of this issues.

Should be called bugs days 2 because there are missions that use a saw and there are impossible to be completed because you cannot remove them without mods, so basically this game is way to buggy compare to fallout 3, new vegas and 4 and skyrim combine, is even worse than cybertrash 2077, I will give it 5 of 10 due to be fun but very buggy and extremely frustrating, the only way to play is with mandatory mods to stop crashes, also there are 4 mandatory stealth missions that I refuse to do which are: Breakin’ Feds, Car Shop, The Yacht Heist and MurkyWater Station, what a terrible idea."
83 GB....
"if you're buying this for the vr mode, don't"
Good Game But Bad Optimization And Alot Of Weapon Locked By Dlc
no sex update
"I like the aesthetic as it’s main foundation, I really didn’t like the endless horde of police as I found it cheesy or cartoony as the bodies piled over each other with constant reloading everywhere, including the soundtrack I had to turn off. It’s feels as if its for ADHD. I didn’t mind it the only redeeming quality was the atmosphere of the game"
"Game was killed with previous updates, it's unstable and freeze forcing you to reboot PC."
Leaving a negative review because of someone on the internet.
cop ai bad
"Not anymore. Was once an amazing game and cool company...but they threw it all away like every other major gaming corp for an unfinished ""new"" game. Leaving this one to rot with frequent crashes and freezes."
Buggy on Linux
even though i spent no money on this purchase i feel scammed
Absolute trash game just rippid of money from you
This game doggy doggy why we gotta shoot cops? I love cops and everything they do. The news is lying to U.
Почему деньги с ограбления не приходят на сбербанк?
very fun but a lot of guns and heists are locked behind DLC
most guns are locked behind dlc
"I had many hours of fun with this game, then I took a break. Upon my return I found gear I had previously earned now locked unless I create some third party account or join a community. I just wanted to play a game I paid for, using gear I already earned, but they just couldn't leave it alone."
"what have i become...... i got my entertainment


but at what cost"
One of the worst fucking games i played it made rage so much for the past 2 years that i have been playin this shit game if you want to keep your mental stability DONT PLAY THIS GAME
Terrible game....
"A shame they had to make it so you have to create a starbreeze account to access community weapons, payday 3 ruined y'all. ):"
okay game that gets extremely repetitive VERY quickly.
"I started Payday 2 in 2015, almost a decade ago now. Back then, Payday was like nothing I'd ever played before. I remember the hype I felt seeing new DLC, the enthusiasm I lent towards playing every spare moment I had - for me, Payday 2 was this amazing, perfect monolith. I had so much fun, and for a long time, that was enough. Hotline Miami, Shadow Raid, Rats... Even to this day, they hold up well and were a blast to play through again, even after all this time. I've still got plenty of fond memories, and I hoped it'd stay in my favorites forever.

Unfortunately, time saw to changing that.

Safes - the microtransactions in an already monetarily greedy game, and directly against the developer saying they'd never be added (do not ever forget what he said to the backlash, if you dont know, go and read some negative reviews here). The introduction of Locke (the strangest, most questionable contract broker by far. Why is this man speaking in south african slang in a british accent with no explanation as to what any of this means? His cadence is irritating, and i dont believe his character or its conveyance. If i could mute him and only him, i would do so gladly), the continuous worsening of heists and managing to fail on some of the best concepts (how did you make *raiding the white house* lackluster?? No additional loot? A tiny heist with an ending to a strange and oddly fantastical story? Its hard to swallow, and i was a long time fan), and more recently, the EOS ruining online play, the broken enemy spawning creating skulldozers on bloody four stores mayhem, and the fact that some heists are *still* unoptimized years after release. Payday 2 has some great concepts, held back constantly by things that I wish would change. But they won't.

Now that the game is finished, finally complete, I can say that while I had a lot of fun - Starbreeze, formerly Overkill, has demonstrated time and time again that they won't do what they need to do, unless they can find a way to take money from you. As much as it's painful for me to say, and as much as I loved it back in the day. I cannot in good concience recommend this game. I had some good times, very good times, but this is not a studio, or a developer, that deserves your money. Save it. Find something else to ignite your passion.

Try Monaco. That's the best advice I can give you. If you decide to play, I hope the game's limitations and poor choices don't sour the fun you might otherwise have. I wish that It hadn't for me."
Bad game ngl
"Kinda a bit jank, spammed mtx and micro dlcs"
"This game used to be fun, but now it's in a state of neglect. Simply the act of inviting someone to your party, or joining a friend's game was an impossible task. Not to mention a truly toxic community that will kick constantly. Not worth it. It seems they have removed basic functionality to spur people to buying Payday 3. Not worth."
Not worth it.

"A blatant rip-off of One Armed Robber, they should be ashamed of themselves."
dont work
"I now cant use community weapons, even though i have linked my starbreeze account so is not worth playing anymore"
ASS game qq
"A very fun game ruined ruined by corporate greed.  I've had a lot of fun playing this game over the years but now content that I'd earned/unlocked is held hostage by Overkill wanting us to sign up for a Starbreeze account.  Allegedly, one can follow the official Payday 2 steam community to regain access but it has never work for me.  Payday 3 was dead on arrival so I guess it's Payday 2's turn.  Goodbye Payday 2."
repetative and bad gameplay
"DLC here, DLC there, DLC everywhere!"
Longest uninstall of my god damn life. Unbelievable. Can't possibly be my shit computer.
no more updates :<
Overrated.
"If you have a lot of money stored for DLC, this is 100% one of the games you'll want. If not, have fun using some of the lamest and most stereotypical FPS weapons in the game. Other than that, It needs a bit of love from the devs, but this is a solid game in the Payday franchise."
the hardest part of this game is not crashing
"Honestly, it's pretty boring. The missions are repetitive. A huge amount of content is locked behind paid DLCs, which is understandable, but it annoys me greatly that I cannot attach a sight to a pistol without paying for it. The graphics and gun-play are fine, but the game shows its age via clunky controls and bugs. Overall, if you aren't ready to spend additional money, it's not worth buying, even on a sale."
I can't go more than 10 minutes without crashing what the hell
Just not a fan of the company. All their games leave a bad taste in my mouth now and I can no longer play them.
aight
Breaking feds is the worst gaming experience i have ever had.
cannot play with my friend thats on epic games
"Ever since update 237, Payday 2 has become literally unplayable if you have so much as a single mod installed, and by unplayable I mean the game physically will not launch if you have mods, thanks Epic, you ruined yet another otherwise good game."
La de da de da its the mother fucking dee oh double jhee snoop dogg This dude act like a baby
i refunded this game for payday the heist
i love having content i already unlocked randomly restricted behind making an unnecessary account
meiqawhdfa
Starbreeze is being a greedy bitch
"TLDR
REMOVE THE F****NG LINK TO NEBULA ACCOUNT. My weapons are disabled

I have played this game for quite a while, and I love it. Bought the Ultimate Edition back in the day. Everything is great. The music is suuuuuper. Great game, I recommend it to everyone who likes fast paced action and great stealth. 

BUUUUTT, I have stopped playing it for a while, and downloaded it, and to my surprise most of my weapons are locked and require the connection to Nebula acc or being in the community. I joined the community and linked my account to stupid Nebula, but still the weapons are locked"
"326$ worth of DLCs 

run fast loot fast leave :()"
It crashes every 2 hours making me lose all of my cook off progress
"too many dlcs that paywall everything o thedr than that very good

hey chefg, i know youre reading this. dont loojk behind you."
"Childhood is when you idolize high levels.
Adulthood is when you realize that playing with no skills is inherently more fun.

In all seriousness, fuck this game's progression. The way it handles weapon customization, too."
"Stealth is painful.

Feel free to tell me how stealth can be done. I tried for almost an hour and wanted to tear my skin off."
im paying for a day
ITS GOOD BUT NOT GOOOD FIX THE FUCKING CRASHING PROBLEM YOU STUPID BITCHES NOW PLEASE OR I WILL HURT YOU MYSELF AND BOMB YOUR STUDIO NOW
"not even Beamng.drive features this many crashes

- and not collision ones!"
🖕fuck🖕epic🖕games🖕
mfw locking content i already own and use behind making an account
"Used to be a smashing game to spend hours on for fun co-op. 
Both high action and stealth worked quite well, which was a surprising balance of the opposite playstyles.
Ridiculous amount of DLCs sold separately, but luckily only the host needs to own the content.
 
Now it crashes quite frequently, rendering it unplayable. It isn't even always my game crashing, so we play a russian roulette on who will drop out first and at which point it will eventually be the host.
Especially on the newer maps the crash rate is more frequent. 


Used to have native support for Linux with absolutely no issues and flawless gameplay.
After servers were sold to Epic, only Proton compability is possible and surprising performance issues were introduced. Epic is known to be openly hostile when it comes to Linux, so no surprise there."
Game broke down after it was sold for epic. Now it's completely unplayable because it crashes frequently. My friends have same problem so my PC cant be faulty.
Cant connect with friends like you used too.
Can't connect with friends online without crashing at some point in the lobby. Same IP users can't play with each other. They screwed this game up. Don't Buy.
"Playing on steam deck works great, however you have to Join the community group or create a nebula account to use a Majority of items. You would think doing either would solve this issue however I have both a Linked Nebula Account and Im following the community and Im still not allowed to use these items. In order to fix this issue I have to stop following the group and follow it through the in game link to the community Every single time I open the game. The nebula account system is just broken. All in all a good game ruined by Bugs that shouldnt even exist in the first place. Still better than Payday3."
the game is very good and i love it but they fucking ruined it with community weapons that lock me out of using guns and attachments that i had already bought REMOVE COMMUNITY ITEMS and this will be the easiest thumbs up since Helldivers 2
"I'm done with this game.

• Stealth is just broken, not in a good way, just in a ""this game was never meant to have it but we did anyway"" way.

• Police assault never ends, cops just never stop spawning by the dozen, even if the ""assault wave"" text isn't present and the music is calm.

• XP and money making is excessively grindy unless you play on ""ultra hard insta death fuck you"" mode. It pisses me off when, even following advice I just can't get shit done on harder modes, I just feel like my version of the game specifically hates me or something.

• Your weapons feel useless, wether by chewing through a shallow pool of ammo too damn fast or by just never dealing enough damage to kill things fast enough."
"While the game itself is very good, overkill is essentially using a massive money grubber just to play most of the game. If you actually want the dlcs at a decent price, buy them off of CDkeys.com or Fanatical."
"Can you guys stop focusing on payday 3 (game that's been dead on release) and fix the only game that you guys managed to salvage and keep together? Fix the community weapons issue, come on. (Also the game is failing to launch as well, this game just keeps getting better)"

This game is wasted potential while yes it can be fun but the difficulty jump from death wish to death sentence isnt even funny the overkill team were smoking some good weed when balancing death sentence because the basic enemies go from weak f tier cops to being stronger that a shotgun bulldozer up close on death wish but the game balances it out by dropping the most brain dead weapons that turn every difficulty except death sentence into a point and click adventure but locking them behind dlc which i do not recommend buying just pirate it since that is the only thing that marks a player a cheater and not actual hacks the game has amazing features and fun ideas but sometimes it implements them so badly it makes the whole expierience very terrible
why do I now need to make a starbreeze account or join a community group to put on my smiley mask I've owned the whole time? disgusting
"Literally unplayable. The framerates are bad, stuttery and always below 100 but if look up i get 300+ why? IDK
Also i heard that Ryzen CPUs are not optimized, and Ryzen are here for a long time..."
"Tried the game again after a while, and now I'm forced to unsubscribe and subscribe to the community every time I open the game to use weapons and masks, uninstalled."
"It's a pretty fun game at the core, but the devs can't release a patch without breaking something. Plus, the playerbase is toxic like chernobyl ground zero."
"Fix community weapons, why do i have to unsubscribe then resubscribe every time."
The new infamous reset system sucks
"Hate this game, but stayed for the nostalgia."

FIX THE FUCKING JUDGE SHOTGUN. YOU HAVE TO UNFOLLOW THE STEAM COUMMUNITY AND FOLLOW IT BACK EVERY TIME YOU LOAD THE GAME
"Why do you need a starbreeze account to use weapons that you already owned? 
Bad"
"The biggest heist in this game is Starbreeze trying to come up with a new money making scheme by selling consumer data with the LOCKING OF VARIOUS EQUIPMENT/CONTENT I'VE USED FOR GIVE OR TAKE 10 YEARS!!! 
You guys ruined the new game so it wasn't good enough you came back for the golden child?!? I've played this forever and never had an issue with using my akimbo pistols or judge until this new greedy non-sense your suits pushed through."
"I do not recommend this game because it has a sky high rate of bugs, constant crashing, and the ai often getting stuck and the enemies on spawning in are either bugged and stuck in a corner, crouch walking, or full speed running for no reason. The detection system is also broken to the point where you shoot your weapon sometimes nobody would detect it and sometimes 1 or 2 guards or civs would detect it making the game a buggy and janky mess. Just speaking from my experiences in the game."
"heists take way too long (30 mins for one heist) and u can die in the last 10 seconds and have to do it all over again, make heists shorter plz"
The game frequently disconnects
"took my items and put them behind some stupid group content lock, first they took my golden spoon and made me buy it with real money now this? they really want to ruin this game just to make payday 3 look good, keep it up you're doing a good job, if you want more tips ask the DBD devs they are masters at ruining their own game"
Infinite cop spawning simulator
"This game has potential. I would even go so far as to say it's occasionally entertaining. But it is a terribly optimized buggy mess, with gameplay was never thought through well.

+ Unique, funny, and with lots of character

- Nonsense puzzles where the solution had absolutely no hints whatsoever that could plausibly lead someone to figure them out
- Inconsistent, unpredictable detection system
- Gameplay that is frequently boring or repetitive, including parts where you literally just sit and wait for up to three minutes and nothing happens
- [strike]Need to use 760p resolution and minimum graphics on a modern computer. I still get fifteen frames. This game is ten fucking years old.[/strike] (EDIT: this turned out to be my fault. My GPU was improperly seated. I did not bother to reinstall the game to check if it runs well now.)
- Terrible art and animation quality

I wrote the above two days ago. I'm still playing the game though. Maybe, if you think you can look past the negatives, you'll enjoy it. That one positive is [i]very[/i] strong one."
I hate epic games
fix crashes or remove the start restrictions for achievements
"This game used to be good man, now it STINKS! Almir please save us

steam asked me to revise my review, surprise it still sucks lmao"
not enough me.
"Overkill when you cant buy all DLC: >:(
Overkill when you put on godmode and carrystacker in a online game: :D"
"Forced to join community group on weapons I HAD years ago. 

Do that on NEW weapons, not the existing ones!"
"great game with replayability but
strabreeze please for the love of god fix the goddamn community bug that locks out maps and weapons its been a fucking month"
not spending the rest of my natural life grinding perk points
the game of all time
"loud is no longer possible due to enemies having more health than frank horrigan, enemies also do more damage than starkiller base. if that wasn't bad enough they nerfed dodge builds to being useless"
"I love Payday 2, but this is one of the worst optimized games ever. Yandere Simulator probably runs better than vanilla PD2.

Overkill how tf did we let you get away with this?"
"I've got banned from PayDay 2 official Discord server for looking for 🏳️‍🌈 LGBTQIA+ friendly people to play with. This game's developers are forcing people who want to appeal from the ban, to delete all their in-game progress using third-party tool. I've never seen anything like this in the gaming industry."
"game sampah mau menang aja 1 quest sampe 1 jam, TOLOL."
"I suppose that security has sort of wallhacks, cuz he can detect me through wall and because of that my perfect heists getting ruined and 100+ EUR for more heists and guns? No way lmao, you cant even fix multiplayer servers for your new payday game."
"It has so many DLCs that they cost about 10 times the price of the game. They also promised in the past there will never be any microtransactions, then they proceeded to add the most cancerous version of it, loot boxes. So they added gambling to the game.

At some point they announced they are done milking and sold a so called complete version of the game, then they came back and started milking again.

I don't care who they are blaming, if it was the publisher or whatever. I'm a customer and the customers got screwed regardless."
"wth man , can even start the game . find many solution and still cant play the game .. bro fix the game . i cant even launch the game anymore .. its crashing .. FIXXXXXXXXXX PLEASE"
Canned coom blam jacket pew pew but then jacket did the thing he do and then cannedcoom not blam blam him again but do pow kaplooey me.. sad

"as of 2024-04-23, this shit crashes to hell and the shitter. i've tried mods to prevent crashing, removing the mods, default, launch options, compatability settings, deleting every single file snd reinstalling, uninstalling DLCs, nothing. same thing, it'll launch alright, i cannot get beyond the ""press any key"" part, bloody wankers making a new game already milking it for a quick buck, can't even fix their old shit can they?"
I force hostage to follow me no matter how much i called them even thought im in a big clear room they're still dont follow me.
Im giving this game a bad review because the devs screwed up payday 3 so bad that it made me hate this game too. Thanks obama
"I don't see why this game is so beloved and maybe it's the community's fault. I was pressured into buying this game because my friends wanted me to play it. Instead of playing the game naturally like a normal person I was dragged through missions way out of my league so they could grind my levels higher then I could progress on my own at the time. It was horrible, I don't care if the late game content is just that much better that is not how you introduce someone to a game. When I tried this game again years later, nothing clicked and I refuse to play it again. If you do genuinely want to try the game, take it at your own pace. If your the type of friend that would force your friend through the 8 hours of torture I went through, you're a bad friend. But apparently, dragging your friends though a grind like that to rapidly level them is normal in this community which is awful."
The most unrealistic game in the world. Overrated af
"Payday 2 is a highly entertaining and well-designed game with a significant amount of depth that comes from its longevity over close on 11 years since release. The huge number of maps, weapons, characters, etc. should provide something for everyone and the ability to go loud or play in stealth on many maps is a great feature. For the past six weeks I've played this exclusively (having acquired it when it was given away on Steam a while back) and generally had a blast doing it (obviously like any online game there is an element of idiotic/toxic players).

The thumbs are down because it is hopelessly unreliable. Connections to other players drop frequently, meaning you lose rewards and potential achievements. Even worse, when hosting my own crime spree I failed yesterday due to a bug that is documented on Steam/Reddit close to 10 years ago on one map and today due to a crash, which occur with alarming regularity. Suggesting I pay a heap of in-game currency to continue said crime spree due to an 'unexpected closure' is simply not acceptable. The utter lack of respect from the developers for their players' time for a game that regularly tops 25,000 concurrent players (roughly 100 times more than its apparently failed sequel) is a joke. 

Given there is (presumably) still a significant potential revenue stream in terms of DLC, I can only suggest some resource is focused on addressing the copious number of bugs and engine issues that are well documented online that have clearly gone unaddressed over the impressively long time this game has been a hit."
Fucking Game. Don't Weast Your Money. Don't Trust On Positive Reviews.
"Fucking Game, Don't Weast your money."
to many black
cant play
fun
"This game comparing to payday the heist fuckin sucks lol.

From charming indie l4d clone, second game turned to nothing else than click enemy simulator with endless grind known from such an exquisite titles as metin 2 or other asian generic mmo. Most guns feel the same, enemies are bullet sponges, specials are not as special anymore since they are half of the law force trying to take you down. Quantity over quality at it's biggest extreme.

Do yourself a favour and get Payday: The Heist"
i spent 6 hours struggling for 3 missions THIS GAME IS FOR REAL NPC'S AND I DONT WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM
doesn't. fucking. work.
Starbreez please fix your shit man. I even made a new account and everything. restarted my pc. and you shit still wont let me have my weapons because you deiced to be a shit programmers.
"Very chaotic game. I don't expect a game to be massively realistic but this is no sense. In this game you are basically running around like a headless chicken under a rain of bullets, explosives and police running around. Quite often there is some many police that you just walk throw them rather than shooting them. Also they spam from everywhere... they even abseil down from the sky in the middle of the road.
I love shooting games and I remember Payday 1 to be quite good but also crazy.
Good story, good music, good graphics but playability is shit."
не играйте в это в 2024+ году
"Absolute junk UI, they make it almost impossible to get into a private coop game, you have to add a startup command to connect to steam servers for the invite button to even be there, then filter out specific games, then the player you want to finally invite has to be showing as online, why??? some players don't like to show as online, I don't I'm always invis. Then once thats all good and done, the player (My girlfriend sat next to me on the same network) stuck on joining game, don't bother, they can't even get a simple thing like creating a game and inviting friends right, devs must be brain dead."
"Got stuck in a modder's lobby, epic"
"no driving. you can just run past cops and swat, no collision boxes or something. not immersive. I will try again on a harder difficulty but so far cant recommend. also why does the drill break so often?"
poorly optimized ran about 30 fps constant on lowest settings with a pc 10x more powerful than the recommended sepcs
not HOTLINE MIAMI
"I used to love this game.  I put idk how many hours into it on console before swapping to PC. 
Coming back was a lot of fun, but it seems like the game is just destabilizing after the launch of Payday 3
Issues with community items, multiple crashes in a night, not to mention the game's glaring issues that have been around since day one.  Considering that I can't even launch Payday 3 (that disaster is its own nightmare) and the only definitive Payday experience is fracturing at the seams, I don't have high hopes for Starbreeze anymore.   Please Devs, optimize Payday 2, fix Payday 3, do SOMETHING to put the soul back into your franchise"
"$10 USD game. Over $250 USD for the rest of the game. Outside of pricing though, it's pretty good."
This game is SOOOO BAD. I do not understand why it is so popular. It is just cheap garbage.
"Hadn't played payday 2 in almost a year come back No John Wick, nearly everything requires a StarBreeze Account, about half the free content is locked or pay and the other half is just simply No Access... 2022 Payday 2 is a solid 9/10 2024 payday is a 1/10 and thats being generous... game plays like its owned by ea pay for everything and whats not pay needs an account. Think imma remove payday from my account as it has become nearly as bad as PayDay 3."
"If you are planning to play this game with friends, don't. We can't play a full game without at least one person crashing and failing to rejoin because the game simply doesn't work. Yes, we also tried anticrash mods to fix these issues, but the result is the same. Fiddling with the options menu doesn't change anything too. How this game went on for 10 years with a playerbase is insane to me.

And I'm not even mentioning the billion DLCs and all the connection problems that Starbreeze has, which you need to make an account on if you want to play with a good chunk of weapons and cosmetics."
"Do not buy this if you are going to play this with a friend that got the game from epic games.

Devs completely ruined the crossplay. Steam uses its invite system while epic games uses codes to join."
"I thought I like this game, 
until they broke the community authentication, 
that I realize I only like the furry mods.

haha Luna model goes brrrrrr"
payday is decent but this is trash and i bet the same is for payday 3
"Constant crashing. Still fun, though."
"Used to be a great game, then about a year ago, they merged their servers with Epic Games, and it completely broke the game. At first it was completely unplayable, but now that nearly a year has passed, it has slightly improved. You can still expect abnormally long loading times, unstable servers, random crashes, and the way the game registers what items you have is completely broken. It would be an amazing game if they just fixed their servers."
THIS GAME IS POOP I vastly prefer payday 3 suck it redditors
"doggy doo doesnt even explain what you are supposed to do after you pick up the presents wonky repetitive boring combat with below average graphics refunded after 5 minutes, cant believe such a cluster fk of a game has a huge fan base i guess people buy anything. to top it all off they wont refund this sh1t never buy from this company ever again."
bad review for using deep shiver in 3
This shit's pay to win
booooooooooooring
starbreeze please fix your ♥♥♥♥. i don't want to have to rejoin the community every time i restart my computer.
"Starbreeze/Overkill try to develop functional, optimized video-games challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)"
I get yall have payday 3 now but at least fix the annoying bug.
"this game is more depressing than wanking alone, it fucking sucks hope they never make a paygay 3"
"What's this?
Join Payday 2 community or link Starbreeze account to unlock map and weapon
I already join 10 times and it didn't received anything

God darn fix it or let Overkill handle it right now, Starbreeze"
I have to fix wrong rating go down lower to mixed thank you
"Abandoned with game breaking bugs, stay clear!

They are probably trying to get us to buy the new game, but nuts to that when they can't support their existing games."
What an utter piece of shit Starbreeze. An old game from 2013 that crashes every 30 mins fyou Starbreeze
fix starbreeze
"starbreeze please fix your shit. i don't want to have to rejoin the community every time i restart my computer.

edit: for the time being, you can use a mod to fix this since starbreeze is busy fucking around with their shitty third game https://modworkshop.net/mod/47476"
couldnt save private pyle....
Dont get this game get brazzers instead
"Requires you to join stupid steam group to use attachments for your guns. Also 600 DLCs.

"Was fun in the past, now broken. Can't play online, can't use items I had in the past because of the move to Epic/Starbreeze. Pathetic."

"Extremely grindy, DLC-locked progression, 7 thousand guns that are aren't that much different gameplay wise from each other, and most of them - you guessed right - locked behind DLCs.
It's an overmarketed game with an extremely hostile marketing scheme.
It has some quirks to it - the humour is fun, the easter egss - interesting, but the grindy nature of the game kills all enjoyment that i could ever get from it

Go play Deep Rock Galactic, it's literally this game, but better in every aspect, made by people with actual love for their product and community and not letting their greed ruin something that could otherwise be really fun."
Game still randomly crashes after 10 years of development. All I wanted to do was commit mass genocide on feds and now I'm playing Tetris with my Task manager just to try and close the game.
To much bugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just didn't like this game. Give it a try but no
if you dont have friend dont play this game

Too much of a rail game. Too much shooting. More spray than twitch.
"I bought this game last week and until now I didn't know that you need to join the fucking community group to get a fucking granade. Like wtf this is some mental bullshit. Im so mad about that like come on!!!
P.S. I love shooting cops while the soundtrack is playing in my hears, also Im on coke everyday while playing this game"
Hell
"I love it when the game crashes for half of my team and resets their save progress, that i am unable to equip the gear i just unlocked, the fact that the stealth in this game is ass, and the list goes on...

And people complained about PAYDAY3 not being playable, as if this game was any good to begin with, you play a heist and you are having a great time with your friends, while the next one will make want to uninstall the fucking game right after.

Go buy the 120+ euro ""DLC"" type of approach from the developers... Honestly this game feels like eating a 6.5/10 meal and then being shitted on the face for hours."
"Bad game, cringe missions, everything is paid dlc.

the game was fun and everything till last mission the white house it kept crashing and when i thought i find a solve for it and played the heist in stealth and i was about to escape it crashed again i hope the developers get alot bugs and problem in their next game to understand how i felt....
en la switch iba mejor esto
"Bought it to play with my friend, however we cannot even join each other. The online is bugged. Normally you can simply shift-tab and click on the name to invite them. For whatever reason pay day 2 does not do that and the invite system within the game does not work. Very sad that I cannot play it with my friend."
Played it once and uninstalled it. Don't be fooled by the reviews

this game so hard
I don't like this game because of someone that forced me to play it
Literally just stand and shoot the cops as they spawn
waste of money

"+++ I Play in VR only so this review is about PayDay2 with the official VR DLC +++

Although it's an old game (2013) the multiplayer part is nicely done, that's why I play it so much.
That said, that's about the only positive thing I can say about it...
There are so many things in the game that could have been done better, but if you know the story behind it (tip; google on 'the fall of Starbreeze) you know it's been a hasty and therefore **** job, to bad because it could have been much much better, but with the release of the even worse PayDay 3 my guess is there won't be any updates for PD2 anymore and this is it.
Then specifically the VR DLC , knowing that Starbreeze bought about every VR company they could get their hands on it's really about the worst you could imagine, it lacks basic functions like jumping, so there are levels that you can't play because they require you to jump....
You can't chat in game, only between games so there's an absolute lack of communication, the movement is clumsy, the only way to improve this is by installing mods and then you cannot play in the online multiplayer games.
Then is there the skills and perks decks, skills can't be made totally full because there's a limit on the so called XP points you can acquire but the perk decks can be made full (but only use 1 at a time) and your perk points keep flowing in for no reason.
There's a astonishing amount of achievements to be made, most of which give the same wins, cash money and some weapon mods, or different masks and items that don't help anything to the poorly made choices made earlier by the devs.... 
It can be very unstable but that can also be because of Steamlink that's unusable after the 'quality of life' update, or Steam VR for the same reason, or the Oculus link, or PayDay 2 itself that crashes, believe me, about a third of the time spend in the game I haven't been able to finish a round because of crashes, lost connection or any other malfunction that can occur forcing you to restart either PayDay 2 or Steam or your headset....
All in all, buy it when it's on sale for like 9.99 and you can have some fun, but if you're a avid VR gamer and used to the astonishing quality of Alyx, this is an absolute disappointment."
"game goes hard when i buy the ""80"" different dlc's"
bad
it's not like the candy bar
One-Armed Robber is better and free
doesn't want to launch anymore on my pc in 2024. support didn't help me
"This publisher (Overkill / Starbreeze) effectively stole over $150million USD of consumer money. Payday 3 was dead on arrival, and is still functionally unplayable at this time (over a year after its release).

Overkill has continued to work on cosmetics rather than fix the millions of issues being reported. The devs have lied to their fans and squandered any goodwill that may have existed in the playerbase. Almir is straight up a con man and should be fired along with the executive suite of Overkill.

I have blocked the publisher and the dev team on my steam acount. What a fucking dumpster fire."
Game crashes every half hour now. Total coincidence that no one is playing the new one.
payday $$$
dont buy it for the VR
trash
Just boring and not very fun.
not enough content imo
"VR로 플레이 할 생각에 구입함.

우선 vr하고는 궁합이 정말 안 맞음.
최적화도 너무 안 좋아서 계단현상이 정말 심함. 어느정도냐면 조준을 해도 구분이 안갈정도.
그렇다고 옵션 올리자니 프레임드랍이랑 레이턴시가 엄청 끊겨서 이도저도 아닌 딜레마를 겪을거임.

그리고 당연한 얘기지만 pc버전을 그냥 vr로 포팅한 수준이라 조작감이 개판임.
내 시선과 움직이는 방향이 따로 놀아서 움직임부터 꽉막힌 느낌이라 길 찾는 것만해도 답답해 미칠지경

건플레이는 진짜 너무나 실망 그 자체임.
재장전도 쌩뚱맞게 그립버튼으로 하지않나 심지어 새 탄창 꺼내는데 5초 카운트다운을 기다려야함ㅋㅋㅋ
VR FPS 좋아하는 사람들은 건스톡도 가지고 있을 건데 이건 건스톡을 사용하면 총구가 땅으로 조준이 되서
그냥 컨트롤러로만 조준해야할 정도로 건스톡은 무용지물임. 온워드나 파블로프처럼 건스톡 보정 따위 없음.

돈독 오른 오버킬이라고 이러나 저러나 말 많았는데
결국 유행에 반짝 편승해서 VR포팅으로 돈벌려고 이식한 수준임.
심지어 다른 vr 포팅 게임들과 비교하면 그 게임들한테 실례 될 정도로 훨씬 못미치는 퀄리티를 가지고 있음.

그냥 PC판으로 플레이하는걸 추천함.
VR버전은 실망만 가득하고 구색 맞추기도 못한 느낌임.
심지어 vr이라는 특성이 있는데도 하이스트라는 장르에서 건플레이 마저 못챙겼으니 말 다한거임.

솔직히? 그 말 많던 메달오브아너 VR이 퀄리티도 그렇고 훨씬 재밌었음."
I CAN'T EVEN PLAY THE GAME ANYMORE !!!!!!!!
i hate this game
Overmonitized
"Grind simulator that despite of popular opinion didn't age well. Skill tree is broken, gameplay is repetitive, gunfights is boring, lore is unhinged yet irrelevant, cheaters don't get banned, random disconnects for no reason, random crashes for no reason, and mods... I found it funny that the better and usefull mod- the higher chance that it will crash the game.

PS: I decided to give a try after a while and oh God, after Payday 3 Payday 2 graphics feels like PlayStation MINUS One"
.
"Don't... just don't, please, save yourself"
"This game is just not worth it to play in 2024. It just a frickin dead ahh game, the server is really suck, the heist some of em were good and some of em were just straight dogshit, i must say with humble face, that this game is just mediocre."
This is not it
"And then god said; LET THERE BE MID

still fun at moments tbh, I'd give it a neutral review if I could"
"Bought the game to play stealth, and was very disappointed. You can't even take off your mask once you put it on, don't know what the devs were thinking. Roblox knock-offs are more fun than this."
Too much dlc
"Once a good game, now a broken disaster with devs that clearly wiped their аsses with the legacy Payday series had, countless balance and optimization issues, worst design and artstyle choices, awful amount of DLCs locking most of the content behind the wall, this game feels like a corpse that begs to be murdered because how much it suffered over the course of 10 years. Game was one of it's kind and it felt awesome, but since 2015 game turned into a horde shooter with tons of enemies even on the lower difficulty levels, some of the heists in the game are horrendous disgrace (Heat Street for example that got turned into literal Easy Street or some post-2018 Locke heists), people who still play this game in it's current state are either mentally sick or just can't let give up the butchered stinking corpse because they've had some fun before with it when it was kicking alive."
"For the most part, this game's not too bad. If you can get by the many Glitches and bugs that are in this crap. Every time trying to start a mission, it always comes up as error most of the time.  Get used to seeing the word error you'll see it a lot when you're trying to jump in with other people. And it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. Even playing the game, you get halfway through it or towards the end of it and you lose connection to the host. This is the most irritating thing I've ever had to play next to division 2. I could not even recommend this game to nobody."
Do NOT waste your time or money on this husk of a company
"Cheaters, trolls game only. Unless you play only in your own lobbies and few mods that will help you kick people that cheats before they get the chance of joining your game."
You can't get all the mask and you doing same stuff over and over. Are better games out there in 2024.
Just didnt do it for me
"Had this in my library for years but never got around to playing it. It's bad lol. It's reminds me of like an old PS2 game. The missions make no sense. The stealth is terrible. The AI is weird. It's unrealistic. Like you'll instantly have 50 officers spawn within a minute of someone alerting them lmfao. Oh please, IRL, you'll be lucky to have 1 officer respond within 10 minutes lol. On top of that, if you're invading a criminal organization, why would criminals alert the police? That makes zero sense. And, as I mentioned, the missions make no sense. Like on one of the missions, you have to use a crow to jam a small fan. So you have to go around the facility finding crow bars when you could realistic just shoot the fans or stick anything in them to achieve the same thing. Or you'd think that if the heist was well planned you'd have some tool to do this instead of finding random crow bars that happen to conveniently be laying around."
"At first, yes, I enjoyed Payday 2; however, being the sour sod I am I have some trust issues when it comes to online co-operation parts of certain games (with good reason) so all I have played was this game solo. While the game boasts a singleplayer ability, the game does not hold any punches when you are alone. I have played for about 41 hours and I stopped because I kept losing missions and ended up having to just admit defeat that I am not a good enough player to play solo. That and the fact that there are so many DLC's for the game. I own 36 DLC's and that is not even half of what is on the list. It is not a recommendation from me.

who designed the heist selection system i hope you get frustrated every day
dripcik dripcik flexsova money money
This review is paid DLC. Please purchase to read.
the game is fun but there is way to much dlc and it is way to expensive so you cant play with what you want sooooooo
Did not enjoy this one. Tutorial was a mess and I couldn't stand it past that
"I would only recommend this for people who look forward to grinding 3 hours a day to finally get the things they want, and (me personally) the only way you can understand the heists (in stealth) is by looking up a youtube video or by reading the 10 page essay on the pre-planning section. I like payday 2, and I have heard that payday 3 is not a good experience, so I doubt I will get it, and the only reason why I got the game was because it was on sale for less than a dollar, so I picked it up on the winder sale thingy. Also, having to get 69000 dlcs just to play the full game is pretty sad, it would be fine if they combined all of the dlcs into like 7,  like the ""cosmetics"" dlc, containing ALL cosmetic items, the ""Weapons & Mods"" containing all DLC weapons and modifications for weapons, and then the heist dlcs containing all heist dlcs. I just compressed 79 (yes, payday 2 has AROUND 79 dlcs) dlcs into 3."
"The game is hot garbage, and it has DLCs and microtransactions. 
Enjoy. I won't! :D"
"If people were smart enough to set up private servers and disconnects weren't happening when joining heists, maybe this game would be good, playable game with randoms and friends. Other than that, it's a good heist game despite the messed up lore. Gameplay and mechanics similar to my favorite heist movie and I absolutely dig it.

EditL It got worse where my Nebula account will claim to be disconnected and lock my guns away. After the months-old issue has been fixed, it has since happened again. Safe to say, I'm tired of seeing this happen again."
no
"This game feels like a mobile game. Its so scuffed and feels like one guy in their mothers bastement made this game. Not worth 11 bucks. I bought during Winter sales where it was 2 bucks for the game, not worth 2 dollars. This game is only worth it if its free, but not for even a dollar. Terrible game"
it was a pretty good game but now is really a dead game because of starbreeze requirements ...
it aint whgat i rembermedd
Dumb
"Man, I used to have a blast with this game. But when it jumped ship to the Epic Store, it felt like everything went haywire. The whole Steam vs. Epic showdown turned the community upside down, and the game was a horrible mess.
I'm talking basic stuff not working, crashes left and right, and FPS going on a rollercoaster ride. It got so bad that a bunch of us, old-timers and noobs alike, decided to call it quits. It felt like the devs were just shrugging it off, and we were supposed to just deal with it.
Fast forward almost a year, I'm thinking, ""Okay, maybe things have settled down."" Fired up the game, and what do I get? The good ol' freeze on ""press any button."" Turns out loads of others are stuck in the same boat, blaming it on yet another funky update.
This game used to be a blast with friends, but it's like the devs are simply not caring anymore. All these good vibes turned sour, especially with how Payday 3 had one of the worst game releases of all time. Not to say, borderline scam. 
I had hope for a comeback, but let's face it – it's feeling like déjà vu, and the devs seem content letting this ship sink."
Fuck payday 2 & bain I thought this game would be fun but it's not it's too hard and if you shoot civilians bain would go off & say you should be put away for live & it seems that he is more of police then payday gangster. I want my money back this game sucks especially bain.
It's poo
"mouse not working lol, all the support is ""eeh turn of your uplay"".. never used it btw"
THIS GAME IS SO F*CKING SUCKS!!!
mindless shooting and the occasional animation
Terrible game
Im gonna goon
Not my sort of game sorry pal
"It's fun with friends, stealth is broken but accomplishing when you manage to do it, the characters are cool, storyline is weird and makes no sense, gunplay is fun once you figure out what's for you, and all-in-all, it's a great game.

So why am I saying no? The most recent update has (Allegedly on purpose) broke the game, tenfold as many enemies are spawning making even normal difficulty frustrating, the AI can now shoot you through walls and cover, without even looking at you, snipers and shields down you in one hit regardless of builds or armor, hell, sometimes nobody is even near you and you'll just randomly go down, crashes are more frequent, friends get kicked from servers constantly due to Overkill's incredibly smart decision to swap the servers over to Epic Store, word on the street is the devs have done this on purpose to force people to go play Payday 3 (A disappointing unfinished live service pile of poo), given what an absolute clown Almir Listo is, this wouldn't surprise me. Regardless if this is true or not, DO NOT BUY THE GAME IN IT'S CURRENT STATE."
this game is too difficult to play with friends. All the options are difficult and not user friendly
The game multiplayer is shit. Ican`t play with friends!
"After the major fkup that PayDay 3 was, decided to come back to PD2 and they ruined this game after some updates where the game randomly loses connection, game freezes out of nowhere forcing me to kill it via Task Manager. No crash log gets created and no one addressed the issue yet - multiple people complaining.

Great job alienating your community SBZ.
Forced me to downgrade to an earlier version to make the game function, forced to eternal single player now."
"Unfortunately the DLC and pricing policy made me avoid this game, although I had a lot of fun with various friends.
[b]Way too many DLCs for my taste[/b]
[b]Way too many achievements to enjoy it anymore[/b] [i](At the time of the review there are 1328 achievements)[/i]

Payday 3 has recently been available and has very mixed reviews so far.

According to my prediction, Payday 2 will take one of the two paths
[b](a.)[/b] abandoned
[b](b.)[/b] better than it became the past 5 years"
"balances are 50% hard counters like overwatch, the other 50% being forced builds like gunfire reborn
abysmal friendly AI like battlefield 4
absurdly unfair enemy AI like PvZ: GW2
melee focused FPS like titanfall 2
buggy and unoptimized to the point of being borderline unplayable like slime rancher 2
overly tedious abandonware like borderlands 2

and somehow this game has a larger playerbase than all of the above combined"
game concept is great but its kinda p2w bc of the dlc's. not alot of bugs and glitches (ragdolls dont count)
"What is this bullshit, my friends can't even join my lobby"
85 gigabytes
"Payday 2 is by no means a bad game or not fun to play. Every single ""level"" (called heists) is fun to play. There's a career mode that puts all of these heists in different orders, you can play with friends, you can play alone. However, there are two leading problems with the game.

1. Most heists take forever to complete.
I had to play for OVER FIFTY MINUTES ON ONE HEIST because of bad RNG and low brain cell disorder. Enough said.

2. Stealth feels very unfinished, rushed, and overall, clunky and is overall not enjoyable for me. Stealth also happens to be one of the only ways to circumvent a lot of wasted time in almost every mission that can be stealthed.

Given the reasons above, I do not believe that payday 2 deserves a recommendation from me.
However, if you have elected to buy it, play it, sink some hours into the game. You've already paid that money, might as well make use of it, amyrite?"
It's ok
sweden
I love this game but the recent changes are devastating.
The new update crashes so often
"The developers of this game are doing everything they can to kill the game off and force you to play Payday 3, an objectively unstable and uninteresting sequel. Do not buy either. The most recent patch introduced instabilities, game breaking glitches, difficulties with matchmaking, and replaced AI brains with oatmeal.

I loved this game. I miss this game."
"you better love shooting cops and lots of them with little break because that is what you will be doing 90% of the time. also get used to the bugs ranging from slightly annoying to the game killing itself. even if you don't mind any of that i would still advise against buying this game solely because of it incompetence devs. they have time and time again shown their incompetence and greediness. i want the best for this IP and it fans but not these devs, or atleast not 99% of the time. feel free to dig deeper to see or hell to laugh at my stupidity."
"Sadly I can't reccomend this game anymore, it used to be good. Then they released a shit ton of paid dlcs, then there was the update 204 and with the addition damage range falloff, the game got a lot worse. Then they released the update 237 and with that ruined matchmaking. Then they released payday 3 and it flopped, so they intentionally made payday 2 worse. And as a final nail in the coffin, the release of the update 240.3 they killed the game by making the AI stupid and overall bad. Made a lot of changes for the sake of making changes (none good btw). A great game that fell from great heights due to a stupid decision making with the developer overkill and starbreeze."
Boring
game quality is low also too many dlc
Overrated af game. I wish I could get my $1.99 back - even at this price it's too expensive.
НОРМ ИГРА
"fun game. 
connecting to co-op games is so hit-or-miss i uninstalled."
"I like the game but removing the Legacy Collection Bundle for the duration of sales so people buy the more expensive bundles is kinda fucked up don't you think?

I was able to buy it before the sale for 17€ or so. Now it's nowhere to be found and the cheapest bundle on sale with the heists I wanted is 96€.

Guess I will have to wait until the sale is over to get a good deal ... ?"
"I have not played this game much but its obscene how massive the file size of this game is. The gameplay in its own right is mediocre, and theres not much strategy as expected. Its a horde shooter with not too much variety nor gameplay exploration, with an outrageous file size."
Starbreeze released bad PayDay 3 so they can ask 100 euros for all PayDay 2 dlcs at least till 2033...
no
it drags on at the start so i couldn't get into it at all and so many cool weapons where locked behind DLC and other things so i just got tired.
"do not buy 
get a crack or somthing like that"
"this game WAS good before update 237. now its just a rotten husk. u CAN join lobbys if u are lucky but most of the time u will just get a error and u cant join. payday has some of the best replay value i know i mean u can play the game for over 5000 hours and never use the same builed twice. i know im hating on the game but if u want too buy it just get the Legacy Collection u get most of the guns, maps, perkdecks, heisters and music. i still come back to it every now and then."
300 gb For Dlcs only
error joining game
Didn't like it
I cant say the game isnt fun but its very poorly done it shamlessly panders with all the famous camieos and yet all the character models are poorly done the controls are clunky and uninspired the AI cops attack you more like a swarm of confused insects rather  then a well trained Swat unit.  It feels down right absurd mowing down massive  crowds of confused cops while trying to perform basic tasks like babysting a drill on a bank vault or moving boxes around. all things considered the RPG build elements and weapon customization is fun enough to keep me entertained for a while
"Broken trash, broken mechanics, broken game, also likes to crash even on good PCs."
"Its sad the spoon is the only good part about this game, I usually make a sex joke but no, not deserved"
"guys this one security guard tank all in the damage in game, 10/10 hostage would hire. But cannot sex the dozer :("
I jerk off to the cloaker
Why do people even still play this
gay
"dogshit game, never ending missions, misleading objectives. never buy this game.
you could spend 10 minutes ""killing the snipers"" like it wants yo to and it will just never end. dying over and over because it wont continue to the next objective. and somehow theres 1 million cops ina block radius of you at all times which is very realistic"
"Truly a god awful game, Genuinely don't understand how people look back fondly on this broken and lazy mess of a game. Multiplayer is beyond broken. Within my 3 and a half hours of gameplay, my friends disconnected multiple times during a 15 minute heist. When in the lobby, we had to constantly restart our games just to have the game show and sync all players. This game has been out for TEN YEARS AND THE DEVELOPERS ARE TOO MUCH OF A JOKE TO FIX THE GAME.

The gameplay is boring and mind-numbing. You're pretty much playing call of duty zombies. Way too many enemies spawn to stop a small group of 3 robbers. The riot shield guys are just god awful and annoying to fight. This game has the worst bloom I have ever seen (where your weapon will just shoot in a random trajectory no matter where you're aiming) making combat so unfun and such a slog to get through. This game just genuinely stinks all around. No wonder their 3rd game flopped incredibly hard.

If you want a bank robbing game that is halfway decent, go play the free game One Armed Robber. My friends and I played that game for sometime before playing this awful game and and immensely more fun on that game than this trash."
"first of all, about 70% of the games content is tucked behind a paywall which is really annoying as the game itself already costs money. You also have to buy each mission individually which racks up a ton if you want to get all the content. I personally purchased all the content for the game because I really enjoyed the stealth missions, but loud missions are a whole other sack of shit. The DLC missions on Loud are some of the dumbest missions I have ever attempted to run on the hardest difficulty. You get shot from every angle including through walls at certain points, plus the reaction time of the enemies are beyond human. Even with the best setups you will still not do a lot of damage. Don't pay for no loud mission unless you hate yourself. This is just the tip of the iceberg."
multiplayer don't work
"Locke is so negative that it makes me sad, like sorry that i cant find one of the 8 fucking money piles thrown around a 500 square meter building. Fun game though"
"Broken garbage. You're expected to stealth when guards and civies can see through objects, never mind the fact the pager system is fucking dumb, but loud isn't much better, Bulldozers shoot you without even looking at you, and snipers can shoot you threw walls. Absolute trash."
"Bank Heist / Crime Shooter, which in reality is a glorified horde shooter with build crafting, and a gross amount of attachments/weapons/content locked behind nearly one hundred DLCs.

One of the first suppressors you get in the game (the one for the starting glock) is locked behind joining the Steam Community, and it is taken away if you leave it. It is crucial in completing most stealth scenarios, and as far as I know is not attainable in any other way.

If that is your thing then that's great, but it's not mine."
I'm more of an grave robber but ok
"this is a shit game, game crashes, bugs, or just simple bullshits, everyone says the payday 3 bad, the developers have 11 year to repair this shity game and here we are now"
"⭐⭐out of 5 stars

In summation, my personal experience with Payday 2 on Steam was largely disappointing. The outdated graphics, lack of variety in missions, unresponsive AI, pay-to-win practices, and toxic community all contribute to an underwhelming gameplay experience. While the concept of pulling off thrilling heists held promise, the execution fell short, leaving me craving a more immersive and engaging gameplay experience."

"play it with friends, or play solo if you hate yourself"
"Dude... *sigh*
Dude.
This game is like so awful and flavorless. I mean, props to the devs for making a working game. It works. I don't have any doubts about that. I'm sure the DLCs are fire, but this game is like a watered-down version of Saints Row [take your pick of what one].

If I had to describe it, it's like if you took the mechanics of SR, then made a single room, and played in it. 
I was so sad. I tried so freaking hard to enjoy this game and I just- I couldn't. I tried to come back and pick it up again, thinking I was being too harsh then I ended up just staring at the game screen after doing another run. After a while I came to, realizing that I was just staring at it in disbelief, thinking 'Am I even real?'

I can't recommend this game. Some people who are not me may enjoy it, but that proves that you aren't me. Anyhow. Join me and the other NPCs in another multiplayer game, because you just won't find **me** here."
So garb I hate myself for buying this
"I honestly don't see why this game is so hyped, it's not that great."
i am not installing epic games launcher just to play online
The camera shake will make you sick
odlicna igra
"Lame, pointless game. You can stand in place and shoot cops for minutes without dying. You are getting hit but you are practically invulnerable. It makes the game pointless. Also the interface is woefully complicated and clunky. 

Payday: The Heist (Payday 1) on the other hand is a super fun game and far better than this crap."
Game won't launch at all no matter what i choose
bug in running game
"This game has more microtransactions than gameplay and the developers are talentless hacks, as shown by the mediocre offering that is Payday 3"
.
decent game but they fucking deleted notoriety on roblox. losers.
"Really boring, missions are good apart from having to wait 5 minutes for actions like drilling a vault door to complete whilst you mindlessly kill waves of enemies. If the timers were shorter the game would be really good but for me this just ruins the fun of an otherwise enjoyable game"
It's shit rn with all the AI changes and pretty much all the stuff since U237 has been really bad.
"Decent game, level 10 is really difficult."
Game crash when me and friend open the vault bullshit and bad. I hate Ubisoft
"Got this game as the free game of the month on Epic games, tried playing with a group of friends and just nothing goes right. nothing works. Its so bad, i dont understand how it can be this hard to play with friends especially since its been out for years. such a waste of my time, too bad payday 3 is a hot piece of garbage."
"boring gun play
dead game"
"If you can get past the toxic playerbase, the abundance of overpriced DLCs and the horrid optimization, payday 2 is actually quite fun with friends!...

Seriously though, whats up with these DLCs? 5$ for overpowered attachments? People may make the argument of ""you can still be good at the game without any DLC"" but that still doesnt change the fact that these overpowered weapon / attachment packs make anything you use viable no matter what most of the time. Overkills 'anti-cheat' also fires up if you use a DLC unlocker, which means you cant use a DLC Unlocker and play multiplayer at the same time, which is bullshit, considering the anti-cheat doesnt fire up with the most obvious of cheats.

This game's community is filled with toxic, jaded veterans that talk shit about you if you let them go into custody. Ive met VERY LITTLE friendly players in this game, Just save your time and dont play with randoms

While the games optimization CAN be fixed with mods, its just embarassing how OVK couldnt manage to optimize their own game so the community has to do it for them.

This game holds a special place in my heart, since its the first game ive played when i got my new computer, but i just cant reccomend it to anyone looking to play in 2025, Please go play payday the heist."
"Payday 2 is basically a good game concept. The problem is that everything like extra levels and weapons are locked behind a paywall. The basic mechanic in a first-person shooter game of picking up a weapon from the ground is non-existent? But no, you have to buy them."
Just nah
ceeps breaking and butting my mous on the screan.
most overrated trash I've touched
Shitty gayme
"this game is simply pure crap and boring, which is why barely anyone plays it anymore"
"Its a lie, I bought the game years ago and I'm still unemployed."
"Imagine making an entire game and then locking 90% of it behind paid DLC, and still forcing players to download it, inflating your game to 85 gigabytes. Actual monkeys in the dev team.

Also, the fact that you can't pick where you spawn, or where the bag drop-off is located, but can plan literally everything else makes no sense. If these people were the ones who made PayDay 3, why were we surprised it failed?

If you see this game (with DLC) for like 7 bucks or less, pick it up. It's a little fun, don't get me wrong, but it has some glaring issues that pop up after a few hours of gameplay."
"Too damn old, though I am biased because I am not really that interested in robbery games."
worst ego shooter in history how stoned you can be to not make a crosshair in a shooter game worst shit i wasted my money so far
Is not a VR game but a cinema screen experience where your controllers don't work!
more like payday poo >:D
game is ass
It's so bad
"Used to play this on PlayStation where the devs would ignore the playerbase on console and it left a sour taste in my mouth. This game is actually really fun and i've played quite a bit back in the day, i realized really quickly nothing had changed. The devs do not care about anything but money and it shows based off of how expensive this ""DeAd GaMe""s DLC prices are. Payday 3 seems to be doing horrible also, don't bother even picking that up. 
Honestly deserved and i hope they learn from their greedy mistakes and lower the prices while listening to feedback.
In its current state if you haven't played at all... legacy collection is good but still expensive for like what 5 years old DLC lmao.
Don't pick this up unless its like $20 for EVERY piece of DLC. 
That's realistically what i would say it is worth.




TL;DR: Worth playing if it was cheaper, otherwise its a greedy company that does not deserve your money."
"Idk why the developers made this game so difficult, this game is NOT for fun. The game wastes your time as indifferently as possible. My answer is - NO! don't buy this series of games. save your money and a huge amount of time."
hahahaha payday 3 is terrible
i hate the cloaker
"impossible to put in words how bad this game is and how vile everyone who plays it is... boring, plainly tedious... that applies to both"
Crashday 2
"Разраб когда-нибудь сам выпустит ""патч"" из-за которого игра не будет запускаться. 

Дело в том, что когда официально поддержки долго не было, это (по моему мнению) было лучшим временем: все моды работали, игра было БОЛЕЕ МЕНЕЕ оптимизирована, не вылетала не крашилась и т.п. Но когда она возобновилась.....моды некоторые перестали работать, игра временами ПРОСТО не запускается, ТИПО ИЗ-ЗА МОДА с другой моделькой вэна игра ПРОСТО НЕ ЗАПУСКАЕТСЯ, а ты гадай какой из модов тебе удалять из папок......СНОВА.

"Starbreeze is greedy and this game just isn’t fun. For 10$ you can buy Portal 2. Go and buy Portal 2, you won’t regret it. It’s a dollar right now, but it’s not even worth the space on your hard drive. Dogshit game, publishers should be ashamed to be releasing another game in the series. 81 DLCs too, what a joke."
game bug / game bad
horrible game too loud and not fun the hard hiests are too easy and the game is borring and repetative
"The recent removal of once popular weapons behind a specific social account is the final nail. A plethora of weapons already locked behind an extensive, costly DLC bundle, this is just an added insult.

Despite falling in love with the game all over again this year after a few years break, this latest move is abominable. If you want to up engagement with this game, and from what I've read about how hard Payday 3 bombed, you need it, fix the bugs instead of locking away more content and adding to the bloated DLC list.

It's deeply unfortunate how this franchise has ended up after such a promising start. I hope the studio remembers why the original players made this game such a success (no storyline, just stealing and shooting) and revisit everything they've done recently"

Also, the reason the base game goes on sale for practically nothing is because the business model is ""Make frustrating game that gets less frustrating if you buy DLC upgrades"". You have been warned."

"its honestly so bad. UI is unintuitive and provides littile guidance. you need to grind to unlock more campaign missions,80% of weapons and weapon mods are dlc locked.

 The missions are highly repetitive and despite the game at the surface appearing to be a stealth heist game its actually a wave horde fighter, and a poor one at that.

The game has significantly less value than any of the other common titles which include a zombies mode or similar because its version of a campaign is just a reward tied to completing a particular mission which is either in base games online menu or is locked behind one of the games numerous dlcs it uses to keep itself afloat.

 the game is borderline sleep inducing when playing solo and ultra repetitive. multiplayer isnt much of an improvement.The ai crew are worthless and incapable of contributing to the mission as anything more than a bullet sponge. 

the successor to this has failed so dramatically its almost comical. 

overall i couldn't recommend against purchasing this game more."
"Jedno z największych gówien dostępnych na steam. Ta gra jest na tyle spierdolona że bardziej sie nie dało. Gra ciągle nalega cie do połaczenia konta w serisie starbreeze cebula by odblokować kluczowe dodatki do broni bez których masz przejebane, i to że połączysz to konto nic nie zmienia, bo ta gra jest spierdolona i nie uznaje tego połączenia. Boty są tak kurwa głupie że gra jednoosobowa nie ma żadnego sensu i o ironio na grze wieloosobowej też sobie nie pograsz. Po około 5 godzinach gry na multiplayer gra prawdopodobnie uznała że cheatuje, za każdą próbą dołączenia do lobby kogokolwiek z automatu dostaje kicka, nie wiem czy to przez założenie gry że oszukuje, czy przez co, ale nie jestem w stanie nawet zobaczyć lobby, od razu mnie wyrzuca z komunikatem ""host wyrzucił cię z lobby"" lub ""host wyrzucił cię i dodał do czarnej listy"" jakby kurwa, CO? Payday3 to też jest jebana kaleka, poprawiona lecz nikt tam kurwa nie gra. Tytuł upadł poprzez zaniedbanie i stanowisko pt. ""a wyjebane"" bo przecież tytuł jest znany przez praktycznie każdego gracza no nie?"

"Not sure what I was expecting but it was not what I thought it would be. Played 15 minutes and completely unimpressed, moving a hostage around seemed to be impossible, felt completely unrealistic and was not enjoyable at all. Maybe just not for me."
Cloakers still give me PTSD
"Game is just so bad, NPC's are criminaly bad. Only good thing about this game could be suits and masks, that's all."
"Eh, the game is fine I guess, but definitely not worth the money, and I definitely didn't get 100s of hours out of it like I originally thought I would. I've owned this game since it hit the steam pages, but still my feeling is ""meh"". I paid for a full game at release, but didn't get one. There's TONS and TONS of paid DLC, locking a lot of the coolest weapons behind a paywall. Again, this is after I've already bought a full priced game. 

Average commenter ""But the game is 10 dollars, quit complaining""

And to whoever may feel this way, nah. The game was 30 dollars at release. There weren't any microtransactions, or DLC, or any of that BS. You got some heists, and the unlock system was SUPPOSED to provide attachments and weapons. Unfortunately, this is pretty much entirely RNG, unless you wanna fork out some MORE money for ~Premium Currency~

 I'd actually be HAPPY to purchase a DLC for this game, if the added heists didn't already have negative reviews, and I wouldn't have to purchase all 78 (not exaggerated) DLC packs just to unlock all the cool guns. I think a reasonable price is 20 dollar base cost, and WAY cheaper on the ""bonus"" content. Like maybe another 20-40 dollars, making the max you'd pay 60. Which is balanced, as that's the typical AAA title these days.

I'm legit looking right below where I'm typing this, and it's winter sale. Base game, 10 bucks, and at 90% off, its a dollar. Ok cool. Anyone could do that. That's like 20 lower than I payed at release. But then there's the MF INFAMOUS COLLECTION, that is STILL 88 dollars, AT A 65% DISCOUNT. The base cost of all this game's content is 250 DOLLARS. BRO THATS A NEW RADEON RX 6600. I could genuinely upgrade my PC for the price they are asking, WHILE PAYDAY 3 IS OUT. 

I ain't even mentioned the mixed reviews regarding PD 3. But just know anyone who overpaid for this game, THAT'S where they put your money. THAT's where this all led, and they're doing the same shit over on that title too. Base cost of PD 3 is 40 dollars, and 90 for all the CURRENTLY AVAILABLE content. That price tag will definitely inflate over time, there's only 4 DLC so far.

So in total, I USED to have faith in this game. I USED to keep track of it, and watch its progress. PD 2 itself is essentially boiled down to ""go loud"" or ""go quiet"", and nothing else. The gameplay loop is SUUUUUPER small for the amount of money they're asking for, and in total, not worth. Unless you plan on sinking close to 100 bucks on it, have fun running around with your basic bitch AR, while you watch the 9x max level dude run around killing everything bc he bought all the DLC and still hasn't gotten his money's worth yet."
"you still didnt fix yo GAME bra, give me back my silent saw 🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️🏴‍☠️"
"Would not recommend this game. No option to see oiled up Dallas, no option to romance Rust and The Dentist. 👎 I wish I could refund the hours of my life I’ve wasted on this game."
who like this?
installing and running this is harder than anything in the game
This game is too hard for the average casual gamer. The police hit nearly every shot and I can barely land 2 or 3 before reloading. Unless you want to put serious hours into aim training DO NOT BUY THIS!!
"Bad:
Get it on discount.
Keeps crashing, hanging every 4/5 games.
When it isn't, it's pretty alright.

Good weapons are locked behind microtransaction.

Good:
Lots of builds to play with, good music, co-op."
"I played for less than an hour and I saw npcs crouching in place endlessly, npcs moving through walls, police shooting straight through hostages, police spawning inside locked vaults, and more. It was laughably bad."
game not really enjoyable nowadays.

"It's just a cop shooting sim with extended time wasting mechanics.

Go to objective, start objective, wait what feels like 30mins while shooting a lot of cops then leave. Gameplay was so slow doing any objective, after waiting to get in the vault, it's then another excruciating boring wait to open all the other safes.
Other than when I hosted my own matches, I would just get kicked out of any quickplay match 5s after joining.

This game might have been new and fun in 2013, but it's incredibly boring for 2023."

"Devs are absolute shit. They don't care about me or you, they see dollar signs instead. They've made a decent game, but over the years have milked it for all they could, including lying about their commitment for no micro-transactions, then piecemealing the game over the years with DLC, now they pushed an update to turn over the game to the Epic Game Store API instead of steams API, causing matchmaking issues and issues with mods, which have been keeping the game alive far far far more so than their DLCs could imagine. 

Kicker is, PD3 sucks so bad I might have wanted to come back to play this, but I'm not even going to bother now. Good job, you killed PD2 on top of PD3s chances of being good by making it a OnLiNe sErVicE game."
"I hate giving Payday 2 a negative review because I truly love it--my time played says enough. But I'm just not a fan of the amount of DLC. Yeah it adds more heists to do, and yeah most of them are fun, but some of it could've been added in a free update, or bundled together so there wasn't so much damn DLC. And don't even get me started on the Steam Achievements. Over 1300! A completionists worst nightmare.

Still better than Payday 3 though."

"I bought Payday 2 to play in VR, and when i did, I discovred that the experience is extremely unpolished, and not at all on par with other current offerings. Reloading in particular is boring, as you have a timer on it and so cant do at fast as you should. the flatscreen gameplay is ok, but repetitive, and there are a ridicoulus number of cops that attack you, yet you are seemingly completely invincible."
thanks for ruining the game with every update
The gun damage is not balanced againts the Enemy NPC

Long time ago they bundled all dlc's of the game and sold it like a complete pack saying they would stop making new dlc's. Then they started out making f*** ton of dlc's again. And after that they shipped Payday 3 broken. I did meet one of my good friends here tho. Falk, shout out baby."

"Paid maby 5€ for this game and it´s still one of the things I regret the most in my life. 
What an utterly useless game of dumb, repetitive bullshit."
"Used to be an awesome game...now, it should be renamed to Payday 2: DLC Simulator"
"Once a good game, but now a horrible mess, it is baffling how it got worse in 8 or so years. 70% of annoying characters, billions of enemies that are surrounding you, unbalanced weapons and perks, 80+ DLCs just to play the game, heists that feel like they are made by buffoons that didn't even care about how game got started, and developers trying to be funny with ""DEAD GAME"" outfits and stuff in the game. Fun can be had but if there are balance mods for this game or old versions sniffing around somewhere, but in the current state this feels more like a horde shooter that never meant to be a horde shooter. I don't understand why people still play this fuсkfest."
just constant shooting cops while waiting for whatever task ur doing. Its so boring bc the cops all stand in the same spot as u mow them down

"After the Epic update, I no longer play this game. It practically ruined this game and has made it nearly unplayable.

I also left a but before the Epic update, why? Because instead of fixing bugs and errors on Cook Off, they decide to release a new $20 DLC."
This game sucks
i can't imagine how they play this
"Maybe I don't get it, but you just shoot a lot of police and are almost invincible (we played normal). The game is a little buggy and most of the items are either unavailable or locked behind DLC too."
This game is ass
Way over hyped.
Screw the damn day 2 of big oil
cant even join friends
boring as hell
"Was a great game but devs dont listen to their player and give no **** about them.
Me and my friends crashed around 10 - 30 times a day playing it since a long time and after every single patch they make things worse since years.
The player base got rly bad as well, expect many cheaters, people with god mode mods, toxtricity and kids that are doing frustrating jokes about cum, genitals and racism (especially due to the epic games update some time ago).
Games like Helldivers 2 are a better alternative right now. Dont even think of payday 3 bc things there are even worse, devs only want to make money with you. After all these years playing this game and meeting nice people in it.. i cannot recommend it anymore and i got to mention a last thing: devs couldnt let this game die as a classic, they ruined it and desperatly try to force players to switch to payday 3 to print more money with them. SteamDB say in payday 3 are 500 active players daily..  good job you greedy monkeys."
In my top 5 games of all time since I was properly introduced to it and started playing with a crew but I can not in good conscience leave a positive review for a game with such frequent game ruining crashes and bugs.
"After seeing the disgrace that is Payday 3 they still continue to update this game and do stupid choices. Game can be fun if you really force it to be, or just install some mods that make it more fun (looking at you pagers)  instead of feeling like a chore that punishes you for trying to play the game as intended. Sad that Starbreeze can't handle updating a game without adding 50 DLC but that's what you get developing a stealth shooter on a racing game engine."
"CONFIRMADO: até com mod é um lixokkkkkk
instalei essa porra e adivinha só: corrigir apenas um problema não faz um jogo com zilhões de problemas melhor.
e tem também a ideia de que pessoas tem amigos. Então eles punem quem joga offline, fazendo você cair uma vez só e ir pra cadeia (enquanto que no online tem 3 revives)
----------
se tu jogar original: não dá, é pura merda.
se tu tenta jogar com mods: kk baixa essa dll aí pô
ah mas então eu vou aproveitar que tem workshop e vou baixar os mods na steam: nope, a porra da workshop inteira é pra caralho de skin imbecil que ninguem usa
então é merda sem mod e merda com mod"

"Game been well to the point every fix just bring more issues than fixes. I'm forced to play with -steamMM command, to the point my game is on life support. Verifying files and everything, checking every corner to fix the game to break again. Amazing, really. 

The game is entretaining and fun, but how can someone enjoy when it gets more and more unplayable?"
"if u got friends or want to play solo buy it, otherwise i dont really recomend it.

pros:
-the game is really fun
-the content is nearly endless( hundreds of guns,masks,outfits, 50 heists(most have incrediable replay value), u will find urself sinking a lot of time into the game
-once u get good at the game basicly everything is viable
-the game is hard, i find this to be a good thing but this may vary to person
-u can meet some pretty cool ppl
-the game has a massive learning-curve, same with hardness, i like this but it may vary to person
-the game is extremly hard to 100%, for a brief overlook on what u need to do ill list them:
headshot 570k cops
get 1300+ achievements
deal with public ds players
need to buy over 50dlc
and a fuckton more

cons:
-the game just doesnt work 90% of the time
-a lot of times u cant join any lobbies
-even if u do there is a very high chance that u will get disconnected
-the game is EXTREMELY NOT BEGINER FRIENDLY, if u join a dsod loud lobby as lvl 80 U WILL GET KICKED, dont expect to get into dsod lobbies until ur at least infamy 1 lvl 100
-starbreeze doesnt give a fuck about the playerbase
-there is like 50 dlcs
-the are some many fucking cheaters it is unbelieavable, the main reason for this is epic games, and the game going on sale way too many fucking times
-its on epic games servers, looks like they can run fortnite with 7mil players a day, but not pd2 with 30k players a day
-starbreeze did something to the ai and now theyre stupidier than a kindergartener, a lot of times they just go thru walls for no reason, they can also peak thru walls making it so u can shoot them even if u dont have wall piercing guns, it wasnt like this in earlier updates
-the way the difficulties hardness is just stupid, on deathwish its hard to die, on death sentence(the next difficully) its hard to live, i find this to be kinda stupid but this may vary to person

do i recommend this game?
yes i still do.the game is still fun when it actually works, and when u play with friends or solo *most* of the problems arent present. expect for the ai glitches.as for if u have no friends and dont want to do solo, not really.

overall fuck starbreeze"
Make it more user friendly for new players. There are way too many options and confusing.
"great game, but dont buy unless you love gambling if the game will launch"
Boring
Negative review solely on PD3. Stopped playing this in 2014 it was fun then and i hear this is fun now.
nah
i like playing as a super human
"As much as I want to love this game i just cant.I played this game almost from the start on my old Xbox.The game seemed fun but lack of console content I decided to move to PC.The game was just perfect and loads of fun.But now the game is crawled whit DLC that u need to sell a kidney in order to buy them.The game was somewhat playable until it released on Epic Games.From that moment it just wasnt working properly,too much bugs and it just crashes from time to time.And what pisses me off is that instead of working on Payday 3(that disappointment of a game) they made PD2 even worse with unnecessary updates that constantly makes the game worse.Im not saying that ill never play this game ever again I still think its a good and fun to play especially with friends its just sad that all of this happened to PD2."

Most milked game in history.
"You can only purchase legacy collection as a gift if you own no dlc prior, making it more expensive for you if you were foolish enough to give them your money at the wrong time. The other editions are available for you to buy, though.

wtf
spent an hour trying to join a game with friends and just failed over and over again. Find something better to try.
"I found the game quite fun, but they had to add all that crap DLC  skin bull****"
the heist sucked
"this game is quite literally one of the best games i've ever played. lots of room of replayability, would recommend, fun overall"
this feels dated and payday 3 sucks
"This game was supposed to end around 2018 with The White House heist/update, especially with the secret ending where every agent of CRIME.NET, whether they be the heisters or contractors, get their happy endings; besides the surprise traitor. I'm glad I never tried to 100% the game because it would have been increasingly infuriating to do.

Then the publisher got cold feet with the delays of Payday 3 and restarted the updates to Payday 2 with more paid content to generate more money. This now contradicted the previous ending. The game continued to get unnecessary additions piled on top of it until it was a bloated mess that tainted the respect I had for the game.

I stopped following the game soon after this, as the following information was news to me that just further increased my spite for OVERKILL and Starbreeze. With the addition of Update 237, all further updates and news about Payday as a whole just became a way for me to both laugh and cringe at the continued failings and betrayals of the players who got them this far. 

They eloped with Epic Games to, in the future, get Payday 3 out the door where it comically fell out of skyscraper instead of going up a staircase. But back to Payday 2 specifically, they replaced matchmaking with Epic Online Services, which is the last feature that made me uninstall this game as I want nothing to do with Epic Games.

Epic Games is a disease that either spawns filth or latches onto other games to inject their filth into it. I don't care how much the developers of this game or other games benefit from partnering with Epic Games. It's likely to do with cash grabs regardless of their future intents. So now I sit here and laugh as the current steam charts show that the average player count for Payday 3 is below 10% of Payday 2's. 

After all those delays and promises made, Payday 3 is nearly dead on arrival after 2 months. It is now slipping from mixed reviews to mostly negative where it belongs. Payday 3 will be relegated to the game bundle only tier of games. See you on Humble Bundle within the next 12 months."
dead game
"This was a good game at best in its own time, today, Id say that this game is an absolute dogshit, I would play this only for making fun of it, cuz its so fucking dumb, npcs are just wow, gunfights are okay but, it does not give you the satisfaction of killing a person, which sucks. I robbed one bank and left the game. Would not play this, but I respect the legacy, sort of."
"Honestly, I had high hopes. I'm just disappointed by the lack of stealth options. It feels like the game makes it insanely difficult and unrewarding to try and attempt stealth in the game. If you just want a fun wave shooter though, this is your game."
:(
"worst tutorial ever, u spawn in with shit weapons and have to defend against endless amount of swat teams
terrible"
game is terrible would rather play poppy playtime
"It's a stupid, monotonous mess. It's hard to think of a more boring game."
"good game i like killing
edit: starbreeze go fuck yourself epic games go fuck yourself and almir is big gay"
"A game centered around committing various crimes for money, usually theft or drug production. The progression is excellent, but too much content and equipment is locked behind dlc, and the stealth system is very much lacking. The popular playstyle ends up being brute force or maximum violence with little room for ingenuity."
BAD GAME DO NOT PURCHASE
"They changed the legacy collection to be a static bundle, locking anyone who owns the base game from getting it.
Instead of spending $20 for most dlc, they expect me to pay $78, that's just not going to happen...
Please make a new bundle with the same dlc but without the base game included, I am trying to give you my money overkill but I'm not paying the same price as another full game for dlc released 10 years ago!"
horrid game. made by OVERKILL myself - a stardiseased studio. 🤢🤮
"Pretty good game in general but I wouldn't recommend buying the Jacket DLC if you don't own Miami Hotline 2 Special edition, Like I payed for almost all the DLC's during a sale and now I got fucked because of that, hell I'm also 80% sure I had the h3h3 pack and now I have to buy it again. Overall good game with good mechanics but you get bent over the table if you want to buy a DLC."
"Has anti ""cheating"" measures like spawning in an invincible guard. I use a mod to enhance my experience and devs have built in a way to ruin my fun"
to lazy to play not worth the dollar
"This game would likely be a very different experience with co-op.

Solo, however, the game format was not expected. There is little to no stealth - this game is mostly about shooting wave after wave of cops, who have little care for their or any 'hostage' safety. It is carnage and feels like the devs started to build a game where stealth would be needed but simply gave up on the idea.

The AI of team mates is lacking of abilities to do anything but follow you around or stay like a puppy. Sure they'll shoot their fair share of cops but the only thing useful was when I found I can throw bags on their backs and use them like Mules.

So everything is go in guns blazing (limited as so much content is a DLC) - and the more I played, the weirder the game became and the more parts of the game seemed to be useless and no other point but for steam achievements and distraction. It's fantastic the game is still being updated and additional content is being added but I cannot get into it, though it as rich enough content that it's worth giving the game a shot."
"Honestly don't know why I played it as long as I did. I think I was just hoping for the game to throw something interesting my way, but it just never happened. The gunplay is stale, stealth is rarely a viable option, and you're either extremely overpowered or have the durability and strength of an unborn infant. Plus, to access pretty much anything that will make your game interesting for about 5 more minutes, you need to buy DLC."
"ngl the fact that i can't keep night light on while playing this game is bullshit
this game for me is the basically the ""I don't know why i'm here or why, all i know is i must shoot"" meme of gaming."
"Deleted the game after 6 hours of  DSOD goat sim, host crashes at the end because ""payday 2 moment"". Finishing the mission - oh btw you need your car to finish it, car gets stuck in some bs fence, car gets destroyed and good luck fixing it 10 seconds. Overall 0 / 10."
The game could've been fun if there was a proper tutorial or hints.
"I wanted to be able to play through this game stealthily but was never able to achieve it with randoms.  The difficulty curve is just unbalanced.  All heists just devolve into shooting galleries with little to no coordination among teammates.

Also 1300+ achievements... seriously?  I wish I had never started this game since I'll have this stain on my game completion percentage forever."
Got this for like $3 and I still regret buying it.
"Don't bother buying, dont give money to a company like starbreeze that has fd up the game several times and fd up their new release PAYDAY 3, giving money to starbreeze is letting them keep getting away with raw releases and awful support for their games
just pirate it"
way too many dlcs and general decrease in quality over the years make payday 2 and its sequel worth playing only if on a big sale.
boring as hell
it won't even let me fucking play
"if i had friends this game would sick, but the only friends i have are the voices"
vr
game worked fine for years and then one day I just stopped being able to join any multiplayer lobbies. Spent hours trying to fix this to no avail. Fuck overkill.
"My entire multiplayer experience is either getting in a lobby within the last seconds of a mission 
or just getting kicked before even joining.
I tried 10 lobbies, i get kicked for no reason, i dont even get to play.

So i presume the community is simple garbage and no one should even try this game. 
Let it die, because thats the experience for new players: get kicked for no reason (not even got to play one second).

I played L4D1 and 2, Vermintide 2, Deep Rock Galactic, and always find players willing to play coop together.

I dont know what is going on here.

Besides that, more than half of the content you see on screen is unlocked by DLC.
Weapon upgrades included."
shit game................
j
"Extremely grindy game, made even more grindier by 100 (!) levels of prestige. And then the community is like ""muh uh there are too many cheaters in the game"". You brought this one on yourself, devs.
Also just want to point out that the community is a joke, because they ""boycotted"" the game after the introduction of microtransactions, then the decision was reverted. But what do we see now? Devs have at first said that there will be no more DLC and all the future content will be free, but then they turned back on this promise and started making new ones after the presumable ""ending"" of the game's story, and the community acts like it's okay, because ""the money will go to support the development of PD3"". Haha. They still went to Deep Silver for funds and PD3 is receiving negative reviews."
FIX IT. IVE GOTTEN TO LVL 30 3 TIMES. EVERY TIME I TURN MY PC ON THE NEXT DAY EVERYTHINGS GONE
terrible
When I got this game I was expecting to have bank heist and/or stealth experience but I got an endless tower-defense-like bot rushes without possibility to defense.
"The game is not about heists, but about killing thousands of ""cops""."
i lost all my progress somehow
Worst game i have ever played. Content barrage of bullets from all side and still takes 10000 bullets to kill you. The mission markers are badly broken or just missing in some areas. This game should be burned with fire or locked away  in a cold dark place never to be seen again.
Steaming pile of $hit.  It might be the worst game I've played in four decades of gaming.  Remember that you were warned!
if you hate yourself please play this
Nothing new. Like most clone games this is game and will be another clone of all games PAYDAY.
i hate this game
cant play any mulitplayer anymore. NO SUITABLE GAME FOUND thanks overkill ya cunts

"The game isn't even good !! Game play sucks!! controls are some what ok.. game play is where its terrible your shooting at guy hope you hit him, then your shooting 5 or 6 times for the person go down. Then in areas cops just spawn out of nowhere, either shocking you or shooting lol.. Kind of thankful the game is free on Amazon Prime, because that's all its worth!!  Wont be playing it again if the newer one plays like this or has the same graphics no thank you !!"
"Dallas always needs a medic bag, somebody take him to the hospital or something."

"cant close door once open

i got this game but when i join a match like every single time people are just going in circles its kinda horrifying
"Fun game to play don't get me wrong but if you like achievement hunting, I suggest you look into cock and ball torture, you might enjoy it more and also save some money"
"Fuck this bullshit game, I get autists for teamates and the game is not fun, you get overrun by cops 30 secondes in and just keep dying."
i literally fell asleep multiple times playing this
"Vr is beyond janky and poor controls, most actions take over 3 minutes to complete while way too much janky ai rains down on you giving you no breathing room with their wonky moves and such"
"$10 Game.
$200+ DLC.
Imagine owning all the DLC and then they release Payday 3. Couldn't be me. Thank goodness it isn't me."
"worst fucking stealth shit i have ever possibly seen, i think i would rather be blindfolded, gagged and kidnapped then tied up and tortured in the worst imaginable ways before touching the stealth parts of this game ever again"
pd3 better and more fun
this game is BAD
no.
Shitty game never play. (I hate skulldozers and Cloakers)
no
"10/10 ! ! ! I hate THIS GAME SO FUCKING MUCH ! ! 
I met Johan G. Kant thanks to it!! it's a ruination...."
I couldn't figure out how to start a Heist
"This game very much feels like a free-to-play beta game. While the UI works and the game is stable, there are so many options and clickables on every screen that it's very easy to get lost and confused. While it has tons of items and level ups, it doesn't feel much like a progression as much as purchases and unlocks that don't really affect the game. Many of the levels are poorly thought out and looks like they were a sandbox for the developers. If you're up for a cheap game to waste some time then it'll be fun for a bit. However there are plenty of better games out there that are worth your precious time."
"Payday 2 is a game that almost lands the executions, and in failing to do so proves that anything short of the goal is not worth the trouble.

The game has a lot of mechanics, equipment, upgrades, and design direction that points toward highly strategic and methodical game play. You have things like how stealthy you are, how much you are able to intimidate and non-lethaly subdue people, a wide variety of conventional and non-convential tools for lethal encounters that suggest tactical consideration, and much more. However, the level design, encounter design, AI, and actual in practice game loop beyond the theory on paper is another story. 

stealth and non-lethal heists are almost impossible, as the AI is too reactive and the controls too slow and non-responsive to actually methodically neutralize any obstacles on the way to your objectives (not to mentioned the level design and interaction mechanics are confusing and finicky). Once you get to the inevitable point of having the cops coming to your location, you are met with an absolute avalanche of loose, sloshy firefighting that gets old far before the level ends. While you are waiting for your drills and other equipment to either get through a vault door or find a code and send you to the next door/vault/computer to do the whole thing over again, you will have cops constantly pouring through the woodworks, sometimes six through a door at a time, and you can just mow them down with whatever gun you have on you. 

As you upgrade yourself you will quickly become and inhumanly fast, inhumanly accurate bullet sponge who can hold ten assault rifle and 10 pistol magazines, dumping, rounds aimlessly in front of you. You hardly need to aim and stop firing when you don't have your sights on the enemy. shooting enemies with dual wielded glocks vs. an assault rifle vs. a flamethrower vs. a minigun all barely feel different. All of the tactical considerations you made with your load out, including a lot of the utility over combat stuff is near meaningless. The game wants to be metal gear or mass effect or something, but when you get to the actual game play it is like a much worse version of doom or serious Sam, failing across all fields."
"Update 240.3:

"PAYDAY 2 - что за игра, друзья? Я в нее играл, но меня прямо удивила краска на стенах! Это такое событие, о котором многие умалчивают. Когда ты там грабишь, да, но краска! Она просто потрясающая!

Я провел часы, а может и дни, рассматривая эту краску на стенах. Она такая разноцветная, такая гладкая, и, кажется, что она просто ждет, когда я возьму кисть и начну создавать свои произведения искусства на этой игровой стене.

Игра может и не очень, но краска! Она меня увлекла. Я чувствую, что мог бы стать настоящим художником благодаря этой игре. Так что, если вы ищете игру, где можно не только стрелять и грабить, но и окрашивать стены во всех цветах радуги, то PAYDAY 2 - это ваш выбор!"
its fun but this is the second time ive had problems launching the game fix it
ok
"Imagine a game. Now imagine it being developed for 10 years and having dozens upon dozens of ""DLCs"", all to be purchased of course. 
Now imagine this exact game without a separated voice volume from a gun volume meaning either we become deaf from gunshots or we can't hear any kind of NPC talking at all. 
And now imagine the same game not having a sensitivity slider for the menus WHICH IS GOD DAMN INSUFFERABLE.
And last but not least, imagine this game without a windowed no-border option. And a bug which makes the game lag as hell if we set it to fullscreen unless we look up the problem on internet and find someone who tells us which folder to tweak in the game files...


Congrats, you have Payday 2."
"[h1]Payday 2 - Shut up and get down![/h1]

[h2]Rating: ★★☆☆☆[/h2]

Playing Payday 2 is like planning the perfect heist only to realize you forgot the getaway car. It's a rollercoaster of emotion, swinging between the thrill of the score and the frustration of everything going south – and not in a fun, heisty way.

[h3]Pros:[/h3]

1. [b]Heist Concept:[/b] The concept of pulling off intricate heists is undeniably cool. The initial excitement of planning and executing a big score is there.

2. [b]Variety of Jobs:[/b] From bank heists to drug trafficking, the game offers a variety of criminal activities. It's like a career fair for the morally challenged.

3. [b]Customization Options:[/b] The ability to customize your character and gear adds a personal touch. Want to rob a bank in a clown mask wielding a shotgun? You got it.

4. [b]Co-op Gameplay:[/b] Coordinating with a team to execute a heist has its moments. When everything clicks, it's a criminal masterpiece in action.

5. [b]Frequent Updates:[/b] The game has seen consistent updates, introducing new content and heists. It shows a commitment to keeping the criminal underworld fresh.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]

1. [b]Outdated Graphics:[/b] The graphics feel like they're stuck in a vault from a decade ago. In the criminal world, time doesn't stand still, but Payday 2 seems to.

2. [b]AI Companions:[/b] Your AI teammates are about as useful as a chocolate teapot. Their idea of stealth is blasting through a wall, guns blazing.

3. [b]Stealth Mechanics:[/b] The stealth mechanics are wonky at best. You can be as quiet as a mouse, but the alarm will go off because apparently, guards have superhuman hearing.

4. [b]Repetitive Gameplay:[/b] The thrill of the heist wears thin quickly. Once you've cracked a few safes and escaped a handful of police chases, it becomes a repetitive grind.

5. [b]Unbalanced Difficulty:[/b] The difficulty curve resembles a rollercoaster designed by a madman. One moment you're tiptoeing past guards, the next you're facing an army, and your only cover is a cardboard box.

[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]

Payday 2 promised a thrilling life of crime, but it feels like the criminal underworld equivalent of a failed heist. Despite its potential for grandeur, it's bogged down by outdated graphics, frustrating AI, and a gameplay loop that loses its charm faster than you can say ""police assault."""
Cant even launch the game now on steam its just stuck failing to load.
"so fucking retarded the new ceo knocked down a roblox game based on this, the old ceo like it, new ceo is so fucking autistic and retarded, i tried playing the game with one my friends that didnt have payday but no the new ceo has autism"
"my teammates didnt bring a medic bag. i play dallas so this isnt allowed. 

EDIT: i play leech so i am the medic bag now"
I dont like payday 3 becuase u us rascisrt
"If you see more players in this game then 3, remember at this point you can get the game in gumball machines"
"Complete, trashbag, garbage, mess.

There's no such thing as stealth in this game, no matter which idiots say there is. Everything about this game is, mask on, go loud, shoot up everything, and then steal things. Anything else is so piss poorly implemented that it may as well not even be there. AI will spot bags through roofs, ceilings, walls, and whatever else. You may as well just play this game with a trainer that turns off the AI entirely, otherwise have fun constantly getting caught for things that wouldn't happen if the devs didn't build this game like a pig. Garbage game design for anything outside of loud as well. Small maps + too many people + inability to choose to do things at night (where LOGICALLY one would think is where 9/10ths of these missions SHOULD take place at). 

So hope you're good at FPSs, cause that's the only thing this buggy mess is good at. Outside the premise, I just don't see why this game has any bit of a following. Because the implementation is just so piss poor."
dlc
shit game good community
"Man, the rush, the euphoria of hunting down and violently beating the homeless to death is incredible, especially if they are disabled, making it more difficult for them to escape my large meat clubs of hands.  I've loved to partake in this activity for majority of my life, starting out at the young age of 12 weeks.  Since then I've beaten around 2340 homeless people to death, but now I've gone off the college and have to ""Obey the law"" and ""Not kill homeless people"" or some other sissy liberal bullshit.  But today, I found my release.  I was playing the heist aftershock with me best bloke Jord, and during the heist, I found a homeless camp, with homeless in it.  HURRAH.  You should have seen my face of pure joy as a emptied an entire magazine into them, then proceeding to light their corpses on fire with a Molotov cocktail.  I danced around their corpses for a few hours before returning to finish the heist successfully."
Not my cup of tea.
PAYDAY 2? I wasn't paid the first time.
Boring - repetitive
"I got eated by the dozer 0/10
ok nevermind it doesnt launch anymore"
they took crime.net down
lmao payday3
pay to win
"Hi overkill you can post as many updates about ""toggle timmers"" as you want but your game has been a broken piece of shit since the epic games launch and no matter how many times you update the game after releasing another broken piece of shit game it doesn't fix the fact that this one literally will not launch anymore unless you put -steammm in the options, and even then it won't start 99% of the time. I generally prefer when trying to play a video game isn't like starting a fucking lawnmower. Thanks!"
PAYDAY 2 IS SHIT END OF DISCUSSION
basically paid for the game and starbreeze login for the pack and got scammed now Its asking me to re buy the game even tho it took out money from my card.
"This game is lagging like shit.
When i put the resolution on 4k i only have 80fps and it stutters. When i downgrade the resolution on 2k it still stutterns with consistant 300fps, EVEN when i go full hd it stutters like crazy. I do not recommend.
Maybe someone can help me.

GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 4090 GAMING OC 24G, Grafikkarte

"Overall I can't recommend this game. The base game is fun and is a great way to blow of some steam with friends. The malicious ads, feeling of power creep by paid DLC, extremely poorly written mechanics for a game this old or that has received this many updates, and loads of game moments where you do nothing wrong but still lose due to game mechanics are what kills this game for me. 

First, upon launching the game and heading to the main mission finding hud you are immediately bombarded with a malicious ""join our steam community group or link to a starbreeze account for ""exclusive"" items"" ad. Expect to see this ad a lot if you don't plan on signing up for either of those services, as there is no ""don't ask me again"" option. Joining the steam community group is like voluntarily signing up for spam emails from a Nigerian prince. Expect multiple emails a day bombarding you with irrelevant updates and telling you to ""hop back in"" to the game. The game devs act like clingy ex-girl/boyfriends to anyone in this group and seriously think that this is normal behavior. 

Next, there is the power creep. I'd estimate that over half of the content in this game is locked behind a paywall. This includes heists, obviously, but also includes weapons... and even weapon attachments. Imagine looking at a base game weapon and seeing that 50% of the attachments for it are locked behind DLCs. Additionally, there are skill trees and there are perk decks, with the former making up core skills in payday 2 and the latter adding twists and power to various combat styles. The skill trees aren't locked behind any paywalls. I'd expect people to riot if they were. The Perk Decks can amount to a significant amount of a build though, and over half of them are once again locked behind paywalls. There are plenty of decent weapons in the base game, but I'd estimate that more than two thirds of the weapons outside of the basic assault rifle and pistol choices are once again, locked behind a paywall. There are still a handful of options for specialty weapons, shotguns, and snipers that are free, but even amongst the sparse free options many of them have attachments that are locked behind paid DLC. All this from developers that originally promised that their game would be free of paid DLC.

""As a part of our journey into the future, we’ll be changing the PAYDAY 2: Ultimate Edition to PAYDAY 2: Legacy Collection starting later today. We want to be able to move forward together with all of you in our community, and to be able to do this we need to retire the promise of free future content based on old assumptions (more below).""-Mikael, CEO of Starbreeze (After Bo left due to him running the company into the ground)

Next let's talk about poor development. This game is a decade old at this point. It has received updates throughout it's entire life. Notably the developments that centered on the game around the time of Starbreeze/Overkill's near bankruptcy in 2019. Microtransactions were introduced. Not paid DLC... microtransactions. A company with modest success due to a community genuinely liking their game thought that the best way to pull themselves out of financial insolvency would be to reintroduce more paid DLC and this began with microtransactions. Skins obtained from in game lootboxes that you had to open up using a drill that you paid for with real cash, containing a random skin inside. It backfired so hard that you could hear the shots fired in Sweden from all the way over here in the United States. Beyond poor or greedy decisions though, you just have very questionable development decisions. The original UI displayed stats in bar form, considering the gamer looking at them to be too stupid to understand the actuall numerical values behind the graphs displayed on screen. The numbers we added eventually, but equally bad UI practices still exist all over the place. From giving horribly undescriptive task-tips in missions, to only having 2 basic tutorial missions, to challenges (weekly, daily, monthly - ""side jobs"") that don't even provide a full description of what they are asking for. The challenge ""CQC practice"", for example. ""If action movies of the 1980s taught us one thing, it's that bullets don't last forever and eventually so have to get in close to take out your enemy."" This is then followed by the task of ""kill 100 enemies"". You would be foolish for believing that is all you need to do, because left out of the description is that all of the kills need to be done using melee weapons. It would take minutes for a competent developer to add ""with a melee weapon"" to the end of the description of this task, but they still haven't done so. Lets look at another melee related task; ""Swing Dancing"". ""No shrink would ever suggest going on a melee rampage is a terribly good idea, but under certain circumstances, it can be pretty cathartic."" Followed by the task description ""complete any single day of a heist, killing at least 50 enemies with your melee weapon."" Great, you would think. They actually tell you that you need to use a melee weapon in this challenge. You would be mistaken though, because what the task doesn't mention is that you need to kill 50 enemies on a single day of a heist using ONLY your melee weapon. Using any of your other weapons at all before the end of the heist will fail this challenge. Why did they not bother explaining this in the challenge description. I don't know. Maybe the development staff are too busy working on payday 3 paid DLCs to bother with updating this game with accurate descriptions.

Lastly, let's talk about game balance. The game is, at it's core, fun. It's a heist format video game and it does this fairly well depending on how well you understand the game mechanics. It's far more rewarding to play it with other people. There are limits though. Multiple heists in the game can go perfectly well for the player, but still fail. This is most often the case on stealth heists, where RNG pathing for guards and placement of cameras can seem to fight the player. Worse yet are heists designed so that you can complete them while controlling all of the civilians and guards, but there is over a 50% chance that more guards show up and you end up being forced to go loud on a quest that you were only equipped to handle in stealth. It can be noticeable on loud as well though. Snipers firing off double taps so fast that you'd swear they're using double barreled weapons. Cloaker enemies that can actively take away your ability to aim when they are charging you (who thought that it would be a good idea to take way the player's agency to move their camera BEFORE they were attacked). And tasers that have an attack that can aimpunch you into oblivion with the only obvious counter to be one specific anti-taser skill in the skill trees. A lot of these things aren't such a big deal if you are playing with friends, but they are maddening for the solo player. (the cloaker aim control goes away if playing without AI, but the rest stays the same.) In addition to questionable balance choices there are just as questionable UI choices. Why are none of the skills, utility timers, or game timers available to be added on the HUD. Mods accomplish this well, but shouldn't a game that has seen 10 years of active development realized that players would like to know how much of their ecm jammer duration is left?

Overall. It's a fun game that they occasionally gave away for free. It's much better with friends. And lastly the developers seemed to bear the burden of the studio constantly being in a financial crisis over almost the entire lifetime of the game, leading to tons of paid DLC and a constant overlooking of basic game mechanics and issues that could have been solved if devs had been given the time to work on things outside of DLC.

5/10. Play it with friends, Play it for for free, but remember starbreeze only cares about paid DLC."
wtf why are they doing crimes thats illegal

"[h1]Giving to PayDay 2 a negative review is something hard.[/h1]

Is by far my most played game and the one that I enjoyed the most. I can let pass the excessive amount of DLCs. Which is acceptable due to the long support that this game received during 10 years.

So… Why do I give it a bad review?
Well developers had tons of unacceptable behavior to their community like:

 [olist]
    [*]First after a couple of years from its release PayDay 2 got “microtransactions”. Most of you will remember it as “consumable drills”.
Just to recap of the ones that don’t know. They tried to charge a fee to open a crate which can have weapon skins. Those crate are dropped at the end of a successful heist, but only would be open with a small fee (real life money).
This creates an issue, because developers since day one said that “they will never add any microtransaction system to their game”.

    [*]Consoles were abandoned. PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 at first got fix updates + DLC at the same time as PC. Then updates and DLC content had to wait a couple of months. Then any new content + update was out of the picture forever, consoles got deprecated.
This also happened to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Nintendo Switch version also came later and got abandoned by the developer too. [url=https://youtu.be/jUOQFgEU8TQ?t=10] The main difference between PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 is mostly shadow quality. [/url] That shows that there isn’t a real reason to deprecate old consoles like PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. At the end this game isn’t exactly a graphical wonder.
Nowadays their mobile port for Android has more content than all consoles combined, but less than PC. Is obvious that developers don’t care about giving to their customers a finished product.

In case of PC this game got a Linux native port in 2016. Which got dropped in support in June, 2023 (on the same update that bring EOS ""servers"").
More info about EOS at the last item in this list.

    [*]DLCs are another huge issue. At first a DLC could include a new map/heist/mission + new character +  new weapons + even new clothing. Then they started to split DLCs in parts. So instead of getting every 2 months a new DLC with all content for, let’s say, $8. Now you have to pay $5 for clothing, $5 for weapons, $8 for a new playable character, and $10 for a map.
I think that even a some point devs raised the prices of those split DLCs, but I can't remember well. That was many years ago when I bought them.

    [*]Optimization was good at the start, I don’t remember having any issues even on an old 2013 laptop, but some people said that they had issues playing it. Each computer is a different case when we talk about running a game or a software.
Nowadays the last DLCs are the worst optimized, the White House Heist* is by far the worst offender. When it was released many top of the line GPUs couldn’t run it at more than 35FPS. It was released in November, 2018.
[b] *This heist is still today uncapable to be played at a good frame rate unless you use brute force by hardware. [/b]

    [*]Many years had passed from all those controversies. Until EOS, Epic Online Services, came in an update on June, 2023 which added to this game some EOS “servers”. Many people had issues playing with friends or strangers in the new “servers”. People can’t even add their friends in their heist to coop and even people got disconnected without a reason in a middle of an assault.
Devs addressed this issue in an update a few weeks later, but damage is already done. Many people stopped playing this game since that update.
[/olist] 

Many of you would say that “Why I care about console players if I play only on PC?”. I reply with “For the same reason that we PC players get enraged when a PC port from a console game comes broken. Everyone deserves a game in a good condition. That’s the reason that we're paying for”.

Also I would like to add that “consumable drills” are no longer in the game, since ages ago, but still is something that anyone in this community can remember. It wasn’t the drills, was the fact that they lied to us and tried to find a way to justify it. Is like when your dad is angry at you, but instead he tells you “I’m not angry, I’m just disappointed”. That’s when it hurts, well that how I felt with those “consumable drills”.

Even if I feel like that, even like 8 years later that it happened, for me the worst part is the EOS implementation. I can’t stand Epic Games and add a spyware that I didn’t asked for. Completely killing any kind of replayability for me.
Even worse devs didn’t learn anything. They also added EOS to PayDay 3 + an extra account to that game + always online to their newest game. Killing, for me, what was a good saga and killing also my urge to buy anything more from them.

I post this review now, instead of 4 years ago, because Valve’s “off topic review system” which filters out reviews that complain about bad behavior of devs/publishers by the excuse of “review bombing”."
Don´t support these developers

PayToWinDay 2
Positive feedback is not available in your region
devs should kill themselves. i already created and linked the account and i dont wanna fucking rejoin the steam group every single time that i start the game.
"i use to like payday2 , i found it fun and cool as there are 3 others and you who use any and all kinds of perks and builds and weapons. but now i cant even join a single lobby for any difficulty to any heist without being kicked out by the host for no reason , no explanation to why or even a simple asking to change what i have. i jumped on decided to reset everything and picking the game up from the start again and i spent my first 10 heist trying to join any easy normal bank or jewelry store heist to get kicked out almost the moment i get into it. an there is only 1 person or 2 people in the lobby room. isn't this game fun? so far no , will i comeback? probably not"
"The game is super fun....when it works. Constant disconnects, crashes, and ""failed to connect to lobby"". Like at least 2 a hour. This is the only game i have that has these types of issues, even COD does better in these fields. you would think an older successful game like this would be fully working, but sadly that is not the case."
You'd think EA owned this game. It's another DLC simulator.
"Had 125 hours of progress, lost it all with big June update. Kinda stupid they'd pull that when running an event for payday 3 that rewards you for your progress from payday 2."
"How much did u get paid, [strike] devs [/strike] bois for PD3 non-release?
Reminds me Everspace 2 devs (and others), who did the same on the release and now get back in old skin like nothing happened. Sure.
Make games FREE of politics."
Roughly 90 gigs for a game that came out in 2013. Keep in mind this game used to be 8 gigs.
I dont want to kaufen this Teppich
"released unfinished, aiming on this game feels clunky and hard"
"My friend say COMEPLAY PAY DAY GAME! LIKE CS BUT NO HECKER!! 
then I play and make COCEIN! >:-) 
but friend tell me he no time and i no know what to play how i start cook?

Games out of politics. Thx for PD3 hypocrites.
A massive step back from the previous game.
No
shitty game
Its just an ok game
"ok. i used to like this game but the community sucks so much that i stayed away from it for a year, came back, still the same, imma keep playing but i really dislike this game and its community, the community will make you upset, no matter what. it don't matter if even racism doesn't make you upset. these people will find a way to make you upset to the point of deleting the game. just like me."
"At first, I felt like it was really bad because infiltration was too scripted and the missions were mostly ""fight cops while whatever timer is running""... and then I realized that's pretty much what people love it for.

In fact, PayDay 2 is [b]not[/b] an accurate heist simulator, but rather a ""heist simulator but we removed the boring parts"". If that's what you're into, you will definitely love it.


My problem is what the game doesn't tell me.
Just like fighting games, PayDay 2 is very deep and offers countless way to express oneself, and both feature atrociously basic tutorials.

In short, it's just like making music : ""Here's a pencil, music sheet and an orchestra, write me a symphony"".
No one taught you music? I ain't be the one buddy. You can sure have a lot of fun, but will ultimately have to learn by yourself through lots of user-generated content.

Thing is, I'm the kind of person who gets easily afraid by overwhelming content without a progressive guide to get better. If you're the same, you will probably not like PayDay 2."
"it would be good but i just need to say that the most recent event was likley the last and the weapons added for the event like the musket were REMOVED why would you remove a weapon like the musket it would have been so much of a better ""dead game"" if they kept the weapon from the event that alowed for ease of use for killing dozers so u can use a good secondary that isnt meant for dozers and is meant for every thing else as your main gun i am dissapointed  but it is a great game i am just salty that they did this"
Do you wanna buy another DLC?
"Goodbye old friend, you was a good franchise."
Game years after premiere drops Native support for Linux. Ofc linux-native version is still aviable but is outdated. So if you want crossplay with friends with Windows you need use to proton. That would be not problem if in past proton wasn't needed. Shame on devs in Steam Deck era.

why in all thats holy did it delete half of my money and about everything in my inventory
"Pretty fun with friends. Runs terribly. Terrible hitboxes. Terrible AI. Cool gun customization, but most parts are sold separately."
Utter trash filled with micro transactions and bad developers
"boring, low quality. Still costs too much money with the 3rd game about to be released. Progress constantly resets to 0"
Soooo bad game
"says it supports linux, linux is bricked"
not my cup of tea.
Can't even load it and yes befor you ask my pc can way handle this game it runs every other VR game flawlessly but I can not get this to start up in the Oculus and I have left lots of support requests none of them ever get returned....
"its worth the price when its on sale but if it isnt dont buy it its just the same repetitive gameplay whit cool music and harder enemies and maybe im tired of this game because i havent paid probably 100 dollars for all the dlcs 

recommended to play whit friends or whit people and dont buy it if it isnt on sale it gets boring after 10 hours of gameplay or even less"
"GUYS DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME THIS GAME IS SO FUCKING ASS I WASTED 4 HOURS OF MY LIFE ON THE VERY HARD MODE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE EVER PALYS AGAIN PLEASE ELTE GAME ITS SO BAD AND HARD TO PLAY IM SO ASS AND IM GOING BONKERS!!!

SICNERELY, MSTEM"
"I really really used to love this game, and still have some good moments with it, when just mindlessly playing on low-difficulties like Mayhem, but OH MY GOD, sometimes it really feels like the Devs hate us. 

There are bugs in this game like broken lobbies since forever and the balancing is out of whack. Not to speak of all of those DLCs with some of them being recycled content (and yes, I am aware that I bought all of them. I'm not stupid just bad with money).

As someone who has really stuck with this game for a long time, let me tell you: Do not buy Payday 2 (and especially PD3) at full price at any point. Wait for sales and when the content had a patch or two (or eight)."
good game!
"Payday 2 is a game that started as an arcadey but still grounded in reality heist simulator and after the first 1-2 years transformed in something completely different that is closer to a fantasy RPG game where you can tank thousands of bullets, dodge all of them like you're in Matrix or become basically invisible.
Add the absurd amount of DLCs, many containing direct pay to win advantages in the form of extremely strong weapons, the clientside savegames, meaning that literally anyone could cheat their gear or rank making progression worthless or the Diesel engine, one of the worst ever used for an FPS game and you have the reason Overkill almost went bankrupt.

Would i recommend Payday 2 when it launched? absolutely. It was brilliant in both Loud and Stealth heists, but i would NEVER recommend this game in it's current state."
Fuck you
"As of update 237, the game will not launch. their attempt at adding compatibility with epic games users has backfired horribly and, according to others, broken the vibrant modding community which has kept this game alive for years. 

Even if they were to fix this issue, the predatory method of prying open your wallet remains. The game locks over two-thirds of its content behind paid DLC, which the community excuses because overkill are incompetent and need the money this game generates in order to continue operating.

Do not make my mistake, do not buy this game or its ridiculous amount of DLC."
"How Overwatch 2 gets shit for being pay to win with the heroes being locked, and paywalling all the cosmetics, and THIS doesn't despite being way more egregious (Competing in the meta requires spending a ridiculous amount of money on this game's DLC) and not even having the excuse of being free (Paid $60 on launch) is ridiculous to me.

If you've got an extra thousand bucks laying around to compete with the game's meta go for it, otherwise you'll be under-performing constantly around people who bought the meta, not to mention the compeltely shallow amount of heists that aren't sold separately. Payday 3 ain't looking good."
"pay to play, DLC damn near required to play this game"
It's your call but for now it's not recommended.
shit game
"I came back to this game after a few years only to find that it's impossible to join any multiplayer game.
All of my network hasn't changed in all that time, so it was something that Overkill changed.

It's interesting that this happened at roughly the same time that they're releasing Payday 3.

I looked at when I purchased this, and it turns out I pre-ordered, so I was playing since launch.
I played over 300 hours of multiplayer when there was no content.
Now I can't play multiplayer when there's tons of content."
y does any1 play dis?? is bad
ass
"My save file got corrupted and all of my progress is gone. Irrevocably. These devs and the swarm of inbred monkeys they have banging out their code can eat shit and die.

"Well it used to be good back when I played on ps4, but damn they made this game too hard now. the fucking special special spam and the AI seems stupider now.  Me and my pal used to play this on mayhem, just the 2 of us with bots. now we can barely do hard and I'm not about to look up builds for ""fun""."

A great game but the amount of paid DLCs kills it for me altho you don't really need the DLCs it still kills it for me (Like a typical EA game).
dead game
"Played only a few hours. Will continue to play for hundreds more. don't get this game. it doesn't allow you to live a life. All I can hear in the silence of night is ""I will give you my all"". I stubbed my toe and instinctively yelled ""AAAHHH I need a medic bag"" (Update - I have played an additional 31 hours since making this review. THEY ADDED A HUGE QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATE A WEEK BEFORE PAYDAY 3!!!!! SERIOUSLY I am going to die alone as this game consumes my soul)"
"I don't know how people have fun and review positively this STUPID game!
All you have to do is shooting thousands of enemies and place saws that they require minutes of exhausting camping. Without logic, policeman attack you random everywhere with no fu**ing logic. This Bots were developed with -100 of ai and they are so many that players lag and crash. All of this has nothing to do with a robbery, but a badly done and tiring fps. With this I will not even watch the next third chapter of this cr*p!! Luckly I only paid 1$! Not recommended at all, 1/10."
shit server

"redoing my review.
i want to love this game, i really do. the characters, soundtrack, overall vibe, everything about this game is just so good, but after playing it for longer, i've begun seeing the countless flaws, poor balance choices and such in the game.
will i still play it? yes. will i enjoy it? no.
and since overkill have finally jumped ship (a few years after it already sunk) to work on payday 3, this game will never have these issues fixed."
"The game was really fun before Payday 3 came out, now it seems like everything is broken. The epic games servers make loading times go up for some people by a few minutes for some reason too."
"Be forewarned, at multiple times you will just not be allowed to play"
too woke for me
"This game just rubs me the wrong way. No point to it or any sense of accomplishment or progress. The only thing that unlocks the VAST majority of weapons/mods/equipment is paying for DLC. The mastercard advantage is the best perk in the game, yo.

If you want to brainlessly engage in carnage in 15-45min sessions, then this game is perfect for you. 

If you want your character and weapons to evolve to face ever-increasing threats (and you don't want to pay $$$), then just keep it moving."

"77 hours of fuck play because the game came up with clashing every time I enter to change weapons in the menu,"
"Once great. Simple. Beautiful.

Now full of unnecessary unfun bloat.

"If you're expecting a realistic heist game with lots of planning and careful execution, you're dead wrong about this game. It's a glorified gun and run with elements of stealth, but the stealth is bar none impossible unless you either cheat or have wasted your life trying to figure out how to get everything to go your way, in a layout that is most of the time procedurally generated. I really hope they do better with Payday 3."
this game wants to make me kill myself
"I have been trying to play this game since it's release, was able to play in the beginning, but as they started updates that were mostly advertisements and the game grew to  3 x it's size something went wrong. I don't know if they tried to upate the graphics and they weren't efficiently rendered but I play tons of highly graphical games and along the course of 4 new computers and a decade I was never able to get this game to run correctly, even on its' LOWEST settings. As you can tell by the computer shop in my picture I am not exactly unfamiliar with how to configure a game to be more playable in every way possible. This is the worst running game I have ever played in my life, the resources the graphics take resemble some indie games in alpha that haven't learned how to properly render their graphics. The base game is like 20GB, updates that are 90-95% DLC related have brought it up to 90GB or so. Not my favorite piece of work by far."

"Extremely bugged. Joining system rarely, if ever works (and its not because lobby is full). Half the time you can't join a lobby your steam friends are in. Lobby codes almost never works. Provides no explanation for why joining isn't possible. Crashes constantly. Poorly made game."
"Used to be a good game before they killed it by moving to Epic servers. DO NOT buy this game here on Steam if you're planning on playing with friends, matchmaking is impossible now."
"Nope. Doesn't find my mates. It's not working. Don't buy, even in sale. And on top no refund though only a mere 30 mins in game...Shame on you steam...

If you want to have multiplayer fun, for which this game is made for, buy something else, because with this game you and your buddies will only get one thing: Connection errors en masse. Avoid!"
i couldnt buy this what a shame
no sex
"Pretty awful game honestly. Gun balance is bad, movement and controls are super clunky. Every starter gun has a tiny magazine. Nothing about this game was fun."
"multiplayer doesn't work which is the entire reason i bought this game, to play with my friends, whenever i try to invite them or join them it always gives me/them ""error failed to join server"" or something close to that i dont remember exactly what it said"
It's Left 4 Dead but with cops instead of zombies.
"Grabs Coffee, sits down to play me some Pay Day 2 since it's been awhile, Sees ""Epic Online Services""
Proceeds to uninstall and play something else."

any game that has over 100 let alone 200 bucks in dlc and shitty netcode is a fucking joke. Can't wait to see how Payday 3 goes being always online

"as much as I love pd2, in its current state with epic online services, completely nonfunctional multiplayer, and general selling out from overkill, I cant recommend this game to anyone"
bad game
"I enjoyed the game for a while, but there r some game breaking glitchs in dmg mechanics. eg have best armour or resistance + many items to svae u from death and you still die in 1 hit from something u cant even see.
I am having a break from the game until they have smoothed out most bugs GL"
"lol


lmao even"
i hate it cause it has nice people
"Shitty game, cant buy sniper rifle without dlc and cant buy barrel without dlc..."
FUCKING DELETED MY ALL K-0FPOEMGVEG
This game performs like trash. My grandma has made better stuff than this.  Your time is valuable. Do not waste it on this game.
"Newest event nuked the ability for people to play multiplayer, even with steam matchmaking, or other methods like -tcp. the epic server swap was a bad idea. Do not buy payday 3 when it comes out, do not support their business practices."
game nhu con cac
Shit fucking game will not stop getting recommended and filling up search results get this shit off steam its ten years old and its dogshit.
FIX YOUR TWITCH DROP
when is the fishing update????
"Worst game I have ever played, do not waste your time.

Cannot play the game at all, does not let me invite or join of my friends, the UI is convoluted and horrible, fuck this game. Not even worth the sale price."

"THIS IS SO BAD!! I ONLY BOUGHT IT FOR THE SALE, NOTORIETY ON ROBLOX IS FUNNER AND BETTER PACING KEEP YOURSELF SAFE"
i truly love eos.
Epic games service broke multiplayer
Epic Online Services
"Was a really fun and great game, but they fucked it up with the update where they ported it to epic garbage, the game wouldn't run with mods, the mm got shit and it installed epic malware (not the launcher, but epic can collect your data) on your PC."
It will literally never launch in VR mode. If you buy this because they said that it works with VR...don't buy it....its not true.
"VR only review
Unfortunately VR implementation is pretty bad or I would have put more effort into figuring out how everything works. Main issues are turning and two handed weapons. Turning is only snap, and on top of that you use A and X buttons (quest 2 controllers) to turn. this is very awkward and makes it impossible to both turn left and move forward at the same time. There is also an issue where holding a weapon in 2 hands can activate my wrist touch screen and causes my weapons to disappear momentarily. It is clunky to the point of being an irritation to try and play."
only buy if you have people to regularly play with. It's no fun unless you're messing around with friends.
"a great game, but the servers are outdated and laggy, crashes every 2 games"
Idiots with broken drills.
graphics are unplayable
bro ive deleted this game for space reasons months ago now i reinstall it and it wont start up ana i have no mods or anything.
"Newest update made this game literally unplayable, what where they thinking adding crossplay to a pretty old system"
what game makes you play on a harder difficulty in order to progress further
It's pretty fun but don't buy it
ITS A GOOD GAME FR
"It's not so much a game as it is a DLC platform.

In 2023 the shooting mechanics just don't hold up, and the enemies are dumb as rocks. Difficulty comes down to nothing more than the number of enemies that spawn.

I definitely came back to this with some rose-tinted goggles. It's just not that good. I would say wait for Payday 3, but it's going to be chock full of DLC weapons, attachments and characters, and microtransactions, too."
They ruined it with the epic game store release just wait and hope that payday 3 is good
cant play with my friends anymore :(
balls
FUCK THIS GAME. FUCK CLOAKERS.
kos omk game
you will not get a good experience from this game at 2023 as the mechanics is very old.....better go play payday 3
"Long story short, cant load into map. If I am able to, then there are no NPC's and the players don't move.

Not sure what happened, played this game A LOT back then. Just gonna uninstall and leave a negative as it won't broken so why change something."
i still didnt get my pay day
i got detained for robbing a bank
Trash game made by trash devs.
where is the sex mod
the updates kinda ruined the game bc it doesnt support most mods
this game sucks
I cant in good faith recommend this game. Axing an entire group of players that being linux user is wrong and irredeemable to me. I had my fun but no.
"Can't play for the past month- complete desync, utterly unplayable"
"obscene amount of dlcs, with this amount of dlcs it feels like a moba game"
"when first i bought this i thought ""damn im so glad im supporting this cool little semi-company!!"" 
they litteraly sold themselves to epic games and any type of pub is unplayable, dude i just wanna mess around with those noobies being noobies it was so funny and they took it away from us all :("
the updates fucking suck i would install a patch and it would take 3 hours fucking trash game
"horrible public community, half the time spent being kicked, host leaves, lose connection to host, banned. i do absolutely nothing to aggravate anyone and i can't even get one clean game to finish and get this god forsaken grind over with."
sooooooo boring
Always sad to see a game killed by it's own developers choices. Defenetly hiped about PayWall 3 and it's downfall.
It's clunky and boring. Feels crappy while playing. Lots of pausing and lost AI. It's like a 1990s game with slightly better graphics.
"If you like to grind in your games, this game is for you. If that's not the case with you, it will probably bore you to death just like it has with me"
"it was fun when it launched but as an aussie i can't find many games anymore, i just bought the legacy dlc collection too thinking it was alive :/"
fuck breakin' feds
mfw a game is killed by its developers' terrible decisions
I always get headaches playing this game.
Who thought that breaking Linux support for one of the last updates this game will probably receive was in any way acceptable.
"Don't waste your time. I had fond memories of playing this game on Xbox back in the day, but it's complete dog water now. I don't know what's up with the matchmaking, but it's pretty much impossible to play with friends. Co-op is completely broken. Save your $ and don't buy this game OR PayDay 3."
too many paywalls and dlc also the guns feel like shit.
"Although the base game is great so many things are locked behind a paywall in the form of DLCs, although some may not cost a lot I personally have no cash.

edit: they also recently copyright striked a game i liked quite a bit so this is officially a (in my extremely professional opinion) bad game uninstall!!!"
cross-platform shouldn't have been allowed when the game is already unstable as it is
too many dlcs
the game sucks because im bad at it and i dont know how to play it
its aight dont play it that much so it aint that good
"Nah bro y'all are so fucking done. Should've never bothered making payday3.

"Gets repetitive: there are two modes of mission completion ""loud"" (combat) and ""stealth."" Gameplay significantly revolves around loud mode with stealth having far fewer skills, mechanics and incentives. 

Stealth gameplay is mostly marking guards and sprinting between different locations to either pick up objects, get security codes or unlock doors. There are various tools for stealth but most are only useful for a few stealth levels, like the silent buzz saw or can only be accessed on certain levels, such as spy cameras. On some levels it's impossible to tell when it's safe to move around the level: besides some night-time missions where guards have flashlights NPCs don't convey there direction or distance to the player and some missions like day 2 of ""Big Oil"" have rooms that offer no vision into the walkways; these design flaws can ruin stealth as there is no indication on when to move or where to hide. Stealth also doesn't really have much incentive over loud besides some extra XP, which could easily be gained by playing a few ""loud"" missions

In ""loud"" there are few viable loadouts on higher difficulty which can make it repetitive.

There are a variety of customizable masks

The game can have at least 50 hours worth of fun, after that it's replayability flaws felt overwhelming"
Honestly its a pretty boring game

"I used to rule the world
Chunks would load when I gave the word
Now every night I go stow away
Hide from the mobs I used to slay

They once were terrified
Every time I looked into their eyes
Villagers would cheer my way
For a hero I was, that's what they'd say

One minute we had it all
Next our world began to fall
Away from all that it had once become
They all cried for my help, but I stood there numb

I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
And hope one day that this chaos and
Destruction turns for the better
Never a bow in hand
That was when I ruled the land

It was the creepers and Skeletons
Blew down the doors and boxed us in
Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light
I tried all that I could to stay and fight

As the undead roamed the street
Families broken at my feet
Life itself suspended by a thread
Oh, why is it that I wasn't dead

I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
That was when I ruled the land

I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
That was when I ruled the land"

update 237
Game got ruined to shit after many years disappointed
"[h1]Not aged well, in my opinion[/h1]

The game feels less exciting these days than replaying Battlefield Hardline. One of purchases I did for like a few dollars and still would be glad to refund (if it would be possible years after the purchase)."
all my friends lied to play with me if i buy this
guns? erm lets keep it family friendly bucko
"Killed this game with the epic matchmaking update and it looks like they desperately want to kill payday 3 even before it's out by adding always online requirements and denuvo, so nice to see my most played steam game's franchise killed off.  No thanks with that BS"
"good game played for 7 hours cant play any more cuz too large
yall gotta lower the size of this game tbh"
"Okay, so. This game isn't too bad in terms of the concept of it. However, the combat is a little strange in my opinion. I suppose they tried to go for a realistic type of gameplay style when it came to gun fights. But I'd rather they went with something like your average shooter game like Rainbow six siege. It's got nice features to it whilst still maintaining a pretty simple combat style. Anyways I should mention VR mode, personally. its not the best in my opinion, however keep in mind I was playing it on an oculus rift S, which really lacks on hardware, it has pretty bad framerate and resolution, and it has many problems when it comes to the headsets cable and software as its been discontinued and there is no more driver support for it, and there hasnt been for I believe about 2 years now?
Maybe VR would be better on a more advanced headset such as a valve index or maybe even an oculus quest 2. But in my experience on the Rift S, its ass.
Also all the new updates (heist releases) are locked behind DLC's if u want to play it yourself / with friends as I believe the people who made this game almost went bankrupt before i heard? So most of the new content you'd have to purchase."

"Multiplayer system is a mess. It is unstable, connections always cutting mid heist."
"Cool game. Sadly went to shit after u237. Bay1k has a video which explains a lot if not all of the negativity that the game receive (link: https://youtu.be/lzdi8ggoOGI). Game's reputation has always been up the roof but all the behind the scenes stuff, development and management really show how shit Starbreeze studio is once you go down the rabbit hole. It's more of a problem that has been festering for a really long time that finally gain attention. Not even slightly hopeful about Payday 3."

"Don't buy it if you want to play with a friend. The copy lobby code button doesn't work, the place to type in the lobby code resets if you type 'f' (a character included in lobby codes), so we had to literally transcribe the code character by character into discord, then paste it into the lobby code search. It then failed to load for whichever of us wasn't hosting no matter what we tried.

Frankly I want the hour and a half I wasted to install and attempt to make this game work back."
1.4 hours is enough to say i wish i wouldn't have wasted my hard earned cash on this game
"You play one of up to four players in a co-op FPS where you tool up and pull off a heist. For now let's put aside the 1200+ achievements, 82 DLC, and the lore, and just focus on the core game.

Heists can either be done quiet or loud. In loud you arm up with heavy weapons, kill the guards, and fend off the police and special enemies for the duration of the heist. In quiet you take everyone hostage and try not to let anyone raise the alarm, but since quiet goes wrong easily and ends up loud anyway most people just play loud. In either case one player often has to bring and manage a safe drill until the safe opens, then the team has to transport the money bags to the exit point and escape.

Each successful heist grants you cash which you can spend to unlock new weapons, weapon mods, and equipment. You also gain XP which works towards unlocking perks and skills that alter gameplay and give you advantages. All of this combined results in many possible builds with an intricate level of customisation.

The game is quite straight forward in practice but new players are sure to be overwhelmed. The sheer amount of content, options, and intricate game mechanics that have built up over the last 10 years mean you're going to have to do a lot of catching up. Even if you do this game is built for grinding. From generating cash, completing missions, working through the story, collecting coins, xp unlocks, cosmetic unlocks, base progression... it's all built around you playing this game constantly - which much of the fanbase has been doing.

This late in the game's life cycle you'd be better off just waiting for Payday 3 to come out. There's such a mountain of bloat from years of updates that you're late to the party. Personally I was never fond of the grind, all of the unlocks feel shallow and numeric, managing builds is a snorefest, I'm not a gun guy, and it takes forever to get xp and perks.

A good concept but very much built for 10 years of gameplay and spread just as thin. Definitely not my thing but it might be yours."
Just not fun
Mods are broken.
microtransaction bad

"1. Every time a hostage is moved, and his/her head go through the wall, other npcs notice it instantly. Going through walls is one thing, but to be spotted is really ridiculous and makes it hard to make positive feedback on this for others to enjoy. I love the game itself but these little things make it not worth it. 

2.You cannot play this game with friends or else you get a connection failure from Epic. I wont change my review until i can play peacefully and comfortably online with my FRIENDS. If you cant fix this, then Epic needs to stop being the only ""Game host server"""
"Late player review:
I've been waiting to buy a good laptop for years, with full hype to try out this game, just to leave it unplayed. Idk what makes this game weights 90 GB, but the graphics ain't that good, not as good as GTA V. 

Major problem is with gun's iron sights, so damn blurry and unstable which makes me think that Dallas suffers from cataracts. The gravity feels quite funny, you have to wait several seconds to finally land from 3 meters height. The controls are quite confusing but fine for new players. The lacking of introduction makes me don't know what to do after finishing the 2 first missions. 

Alright the online heists. I don't know what the hell is going on but I kept joining a whole carnage in the middle of the heist, then I found the heist filter that gives me ability to find servers that is ABOUT to start, and still have no idea wtf is going on. I don't know the timeline of the heists, and when I throw my dart blindly onto the board, I get teleported to extra hard heists and then I leave the game. 

Right, and now the cops. What the hell am I playing. Hordes of cops come after me spamming bullets and tasers. Bulldozers everywhere. They keep coming and won't even let you breathe. Again, the graphics makes it difficult to see the cops from distance. My laptop is really good, it runs other games pretty well, so it can't be any issues from my laptop. Alright if this game was released like tens of years ago, I don't see any development to the game graphics considering all the pricey dlcs and the solid income. Even L4D2 graphics is way better than this, and that thing weighs only like 4 GB. 

I've been a solid huge fan to PayDay 2 even if I didn't get to enjoy this game 12 years ago. I've been interested in the story, I loved the web series, I loved the characters, like everything. I EVEN PLAYED THE DAMN ROBLOX RIPOFF VERSION OF THIS GAME since I didn't have any good laptops back then, aaand just to find myself don't likey this game. This may sound silly as shit but I found Roblox version is quite better than this one (as a new player)(I used to be new too on the Roblox version, but I'm able to understand the game mechanics in short time). Thank god I tried this game, so I don't have to be interested in PayDay 3, but I'll follow the storyline :). Thanks StarBreeze for be part of my childhood. I give this game a 4/10 because of 90 GB for no reason, but 10/10 for the lore."
trash game and gives me cancer shooting down scho- i mean bulldozers
CRASH
Just wait for Payday 3 for now :)
This game absolutely does not work. The UI is horrendous and bloated on crime net. almost every single heist you load into does not load properly. this is shit  and it used to not be this way.
USE TO LOVE THIS GAME CAME BACK TO PLAY BEFORE THREE COMES OUT.THE GAME IS SO FULL OF BUGS NO ITS UN REAL ITS UNPLAYABLE
Don't start
"I am thankful to overkill/starbreeze for revealing their intention to scam and profit while pretending to be pro community right before payday 3, saved me some money. Shame i can't refund this game that was made into a piece of garbage for a quick paycheck, but oh well, you live and you learn."
this game promotes robbery and thief this is not good there shoulkd be get reported to govrnment they will get caught

* The Epic Games Store Crossplay integration is shoddy.
* & Payday 3 is going to be always online.

Sad.
At least I'll still be able to play Payday 2 on the go; I just wish I could've said the same for Payday 3.

You can set the launch option ""-steamMM"" to opt out of EGS crossplay & change back to the og matchmaking."

Forced matchmaking through Epic Games even if you're on steam.
Crew AI animations are very broken? https://steamcommunity.com/id/windBugg_/screenshot/2488875201243153240/

Apparently dragging the brand through the dirt didn't just include messing up Payday 3, they had to go back and ruin a game that was already really good.

If you're playing multiplayer? Don't. If you're playing solo, get mods."

"Fuck epic servers, fuck always online, fuck micro-transactions"
Requiring stealth missions to perform a shitty fucking final ending that ruins the entire vibe of the game is one of the worst decisions ever made by a developer. Especially since the shitty ending takes so long.
"i bought everything on console shortly before i lost hope of support


how the fuck did i already play over 15 hours wtf"
"This is not a bad game, but I just feel like there is so much missed potential. There's way too many things packed into this game, and no coherent structure, but the things are not unique enough to feel super interesting. You can enjoy this game the best if you just take a small slice rather than trying to dig into the whole thing. The shooting is good but gets stale eventually, and the stealth seems far too constrained and simple. There is a lot of stuff to love, and I had a good time with it, but the game just generally feels very cluttered and unpolished."
I sadly have thousands of hours in game and it means a lot to me as it is a really fun multiplayer experience but for those actually curious this game has a lot of fun class and weapons some better than others with some being outright useless but still fun this game is really old but in my opinion still holds up too this day due to the art-style non the less but as the years go by there is less and less support for the game and the community is either some of the nicest people you'll mean playing an online video game and some who are completely brain dead and honestly take away from the experience from the game and that sucks I guess and I will address the elephant in the room this game is infested with bot and cheaters actively trying to ruin the game cause I guess its funny to them and the devs are not doing much even with the most recent update making the player counts the highest in the games history but i do not see the issue really being solved as most likely with the most recent update being somewhat lazy and not checked for easily found exploits but this game in the state that it is I can not recommend this game as once the crazy from the update dies down the bots will return taking over game and ruining the fun and no community servers can replicate casual because they are either too gimmicky or uncle topia (tryhards) so please valve update Team Fortress 2 no content updates are completely fine not even a balance patch for broken weapons just an update that will fix the bots possibly a new anti cheat system (also let free to pays talk that will be cool :))

"Update 237, EOS, shit game, fucking russian kicks me, always stuck in loading screen, spent 70% of my playtime in loading screen. the game is dead now. you don't even know what lobbies your going in, you could be going in asia or fucking alaska."
"Multiplayer is broken on Steam since update 287 because of Epic games matchmaking integration.
It also broke most mods in the process.
One month after, still broken, I can't play a co-op game with friends.

But hey, go buy PAYDAY 3, right? Microtransations on an always online game seems a good fit with such trusted and talented developers."
"There are so many police that it is physically impossible to kill all of them and take advantage of the short periods of time where you aren't getting assaulted. There will usually be 50 of them out at once with nothing you can do, and mind you, this is on the easiest difficulty. Do people genuinely have fun playing this game? Maybe it would have been better if I played online, but that's not my cup of tea."
"Bought this game recently while on sale. Enjoyed the shit out of it for a day or two and then suddenly became totally unplayable. Freezing up constantly, crashing to desktop. lagging out. Sad because i waited years to finally play this game and got a positive experience for about 1 day."
only if update 237 wasnt made
"This is a nice game, but it f♥♥king ruined my desktop icon layout when first time startup in fullscreen mode with a low resolution."
"Mediocre at best. It's a zombie horde shooter where they substituted the undead with cops Left 4 Dead style. If you hate on the man this is absolutely for you. The game isn't bad, it's just incredibly repetitive and ultimately somewhat boring. It's got a lot of content- weapons, missions, costumes but many of them are siloed behind a paywall. I'm not too into that business model. So you're stuck with the bare minimum unless you spend more loot to get the content variety. The missions are all pretty much slight variations of the same theme so it's straightforward and entirely consistent but that's a big contributor to the mundane. After about 20 hours it felt like more of a chore than anything else.

Wait for a sale to hate on the police.

I certainly don't need a Payday 3. I'll stick with the candy bar thanks."
My friends all stopped talking to me the moment I played payday 2
"They migrated the online services to Epic servers. Now, most online lobbies won't let you load into the level after you've joined."
"bad game but love it good but you need to know meta for dsod or be really really good
R.I.P Carrot,Uncle geldgeil,Ace,kevkild but he play it sometimes. The 237 update remove it's content creator youtubers from the game it sucks now i need to go the reddit or steam to see whats good in the game 
R.I.P the game
700 hours still play it back when 800 hours
and now when i try to load it it keeps loading forever
Edit: it's better than payday 3 but i disconnect so much now and i can't get some achievements spend 5 hours on one achievement i give up but get it on a sale not full price"
i tried to make a good review but i couldnt load it in
"This game is really bad. The game made me addicted to rob a virtual bank 


DONT PLAY THIS GAME !!!!!!


I WARNED YOU !!!!!!!

What a fun idea to be able to play a vr co-op game with my poor desktop only friends. Too bad the developers were on actual cocaine when they designed the worst vr controls in any game ever made in the history of making games.
terrible

"Dony get this game now. Due to the servers now being linked to epic store, if epic has problems due to fortnite this game wont work. PLS REVIEW BOMB THIS.  

Other review that makes things better understod.
""The recent Epic Online Services update added crossplay for Epic players at the expense of Steam players. The game won't even function without being connected to Epic. So if they're having server issues from some big Fortnite update, it's going to affect this game too. Where previously it didn't.

The devs have stayed silent regarding the PD2 community's discontentment regarding this recent change, so I'll be happy to give them this review. Don't buy any further Payday games/DLC, remove them from your wishlist and following list, and tell your friends to do the same. It's the only way they'll learn.

Edit: They recently posted a community announcement update with no mention of removing EOS in the game, so my review stands."""
"They switched to Epic Game's matchmaking servers... for the Steam version.....
How thick can your skulls be?
I can't connect to play online at all right now, crossplay is nice but isn't worth it at the cost of not being able to play online at all."
89GB?
i need a medic bag
they killed the game with the current patch i cant find matches
"I'll start by saying, I loved this game and the gameplay it had provided. It has definitely provided me with many hours of entertainment, and to say I got my moneys worth is an understatement. However that said, I can't recommend this game in good faith to anyone.

A recent update was akin to taking a beloved family pet out back and shooting it when it wasn't looking. They completely crippled the matchmaking and abandoned Linux support, all so they can make the game free on Epic games and implement crossplay with them (removing crossplay with Linux). Sure there are more Epic games users than Linux users, but there was always the option to buy this for less than £1 in a Steam sale, an extremely low barrier to entry.

However the main disappointing thing is trust in the developers is gone. For years players have voiced their concerns to the development team in the forums that they wouldn't want the upcoming game Payday 3 to have anything to do with Epic Games. As the largest Steam community group it makes sense that at least some people have this kind of launcher loyalty. However it was clear years in advance that the community didn't want something like what recently happened to happen. That said the developers decided to do it anyway.

I'm not sure if this was a result of them having to accept a publisher agreement with anyone who came along due to the financial struggles, or if they had agency to choose to turn it down, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter, the game is still worse off because of it.

This game will still be superior to the upcoming release Payday 3, which looks absolutely horrendous mechanically, however that's a low bar.

Gameplay wise last I checked several heists (missions/levels) straight up don't work. Connection to other players is borked, especially in multi-day heists. There are more cheaters and pirates than ever. And they kept adding weapons as paid DLC but no inventory room to hold said weapons. Games are still peer to peer but the matchmaking having changed makes the game was more unstable.

Overall the game is in a sad state, it was willingly made into what it is now just months away from retirement. Despite concerns being voiced for years about this exact kind of thing. It's almost funny how wrong the developers got it. Almost, in reality it's just sad."
Can't recommend this game in its current state.
sad that this game didnt hit me like others. :(

"I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone without very specific tastes.

The game is a little janky at best, actively hates new players by gimping their progression early on and basically forcing you to buy massive amounts of DLC to be playable on harder difficulties because of a decade worth of powercreep. Not to mention the devs having a spotty history with questionable decicion making and player communication, and the recent matchmaking fiasco (I bought this game a day before the move to EGS, it was working fine on that day, but has been unstable ever since, even with various workarounds).

If fast paced PvE is something you absolutely love and need more of, right now, then you can consider trying Payday out, but I don't think it's worth anybody else's time, especially looking at recent actions of Overkill and the risk of them killing of this game any moment, as they did with the Linux version, looming."

this game sucks to play with friends everyone always disconnects if we can even get everyone in a party together. game is jank as hell now. if you all fix it then maybe it would be fun again

"Gee, sure love dumping an hour into a difficult heist, getting towards the end of it, just for the game to crash and have me forfeit all my cash and XP I would have earned. Great job, developers! You had one job, and over 10 years to do it."
"Man this game stinks. I already know im gonna get a lot of hate for it but after playing for a full day almost at this point I can say it stinks. The AI isn't very useful so if you ever want to play this offline or by yourself expect to do ALL the lifting. The AI does hold it's own against the enemy at least. I rarely if ever saw them get downed and need to be revived. Meanwhile because I was having to do all the lifting of the big items I was constantly having to be picked up by them cause I was moving slower. 

Now if you go for online with other people it makes it WAY better and more fun. Except for the fact the games servers really stink. There has been SO many times where I have gotten stuck on a frozen screen waiting for: A player to join, connect to a server, loading the map, waiting for the payday card, waiting for other players to be ""ready"". Now it doesn't look frozen in some instances cause you can still hit escape in some of those instances and quit to main menu but if you are near the end of the mission you then will lose out on all that work you did. There has been many times where it will show a player joining only for it to be stuck at 97% or 99% and so your sitting there for 5 minutes waiting only for connection to the host lost or some crap. 

There has been many times where I click ""ready"" and see other people ""not ready"" but they claim in chat they are ready but everyone else is ""not ready"". There was even a mission where it was VERY difficult like one of the worst difficulties and I was with 3 others that were way better and just following them. I was managing my own but I know if it wasn't for them I would have been taken out countless times. It was a chase mission following a white van. All of a sudden like a block from the van everyone froze. The enemies were just sitting there and I could walk around and head shot them all. My team mates were also frozen. I tried reviving one only for it to keep making the sound like I did but nothing happened. Got to the van with an ! and couldn't interact. One of the other players said they could see me but I couldn't see them moving, they asked me to get the gas can to light the van on fire. I got the can but couldn't do anything at the van. So basically had to leave the server cause there was nothing I could do at that point. All that work for NOTHING! Like WTF ""OVERKILL"" ? 

Why are your servers so dog poo? This is why I hate games these days when you have to rely on the companies servers. If they allowed players to host their own servers to, then maybe we wouldn't have this many problems. Also the fact that in idk 20 years when they turn off the servers then you're out getting to play the game anymore, except maybe in offline mode with the bad AI. 

There is also the fact there is HUGE amounts of DLC that you need to buy in order to access.. hmm most of the weapons, skins etc. if not more. The skins are one thing but locking certain weapons behind DLC is a bit annoying. Would be nice if you could randomly win them over time from playing some missions but oh well. That also raises the attachments for the weapons. I bought a silencer for a weapon and then later decided to take it off and it said it went to my inventory. Okay but then I couldn't find a way to put it back on the weapon. I looked it up and saw posts stating you have to pay to use the attachments if you take them back off. So it's just a money sink (in game money) which is really annoying. As well as some attachments you can't get cause they are ""unavailable"" until you get them from random payday card picks? So you're gonna have to grind A LOT to get different attachments while also getting colors, skins, money, XP as possible payday cards instead. 

I am still upset about the countless disconnects from the servers in the middle or at the end of a mission losing out on all the work and the rewards because of their stupid servers. And I know it's their servers because my internet is quite fast, I can watch shows/movies without having to worry about buffering etc. And thus the game also feels a bit like p2w because of having certain better weapons/items stuck behind DLC. 

I am kinda glad I got this game for just a $1 cause of the sale recently. Apparently it was free a few years ago but missed out on it back then. I am guessing they are doing this sale to get people interested in the game to try and sell them Payday 3 when it comes out. But with how bad these bugs/glitches are especially with the servers it just shows to wait or not get the 3rd game because after all this time this game still has these kind of problems, really? 

One person in one of the missions said it has to do with Epic Games launcher messing up cause there is cross platform play or something? No idea how true that is but still annoying.

The premise and gameplay can be a lot of fun. There was many times I was eagerly wanting to run a bank heist only for some bug/glitch where you are seen through a wall, or lose the connection with the server and by the time you try and get back in it's full or ""failed"" to connect. There has also been a number of times trying to join a public mission only to be kicked right away. Heck one of them today I got banned, and then kicked from a server I tried joining. Like if you don't want people joining your server, make it private you morons. 

Also seeing ""cheater"" above some peoples heads is a bit weird. So the game knows the person is cheating but allow them to? As well as people getting kicked for having mods I guess? I don't have any but didn't even know there was some out there. And seeing stuff like ""green package"" or whatever being picked up by other players but then at the end of the game seeing a message in red ""you need to own bla DLC in order to receive this"" or something is a bit annoying as well. 

One player in voice chat mentioned owning the game since release and how it was much worse back then with certain stuff but has since gotten better. I know if I would have paid full price for this game I would have been really pissed off by how bad it is now let alone if it was worse a while back. Right now if you get the game for free or dirt cheap then it's a gamble if you're gonna have fun with so many server issues. As well as be prepared for a long grind to get rewards.

Again losing out on lots of money, xp, and payday card reward because the server messed up and you get sent to the main menu at the end of a mission over and over again is infuriating. Happening over and over again, even during this 10 year event is really annoying. Especially after spending a good hour or so for none of it to matter at all. Making this game more like a chore than fun."
"gunplay is terrible, outdated and trash, anti cheat is very bad, i hate the movie, i hate the game, super boring, every item is dlc and costs even more money just to waste your time and money playing a stinky game with over 1,000 achievements. i hate."
"Sucks that they let the game go. Minor bug fixes would make this game playable, but nope. Decided to buy the last of the DLCs, I know mistake, just wanted to play them and get a ltitle fun in before payday 3, but they've abandoned this, but are still releasing content and taking people's money yet they won't even take a moment to fix the minor bugs. Makes me really not want to get and play the 3rd one because they could just abandon us again. Sucks playing crash simulator 2023."
horrible UI. floaty controls. goofy stealth
"This is the worst experience of a game you will ever have. I have a steam deck and the game used to run fine through proton or linux runtime, now it only actually launches in the linux runtime. There's a problem though: This game is only fun with friends. They dont update the linux version anymore so you cant play online, while they proudly take advantage of the verified seal and put on their store page its linux compatible. I tried to get a refund but due to this process of trying to get the game to launch I spent too long in menus to return it. Dont waste your money if you have a steam deck. This should be marked as unplayable."
My game crashed to show this review screen on Steam. Thanks for leaving the game in terrible condition Overkill. Fun game tho.

"if i had a dollar for every brightness in this game, i would be in debt holy fuck!"
"Game has become unplayable. 
When you try to join someone else's lobby, you (most of the time) do not load in, game tells you that you are waiting on others ""Joining"". This is not the case. You sit there for 5-10 mins, until you get bored, join a different lobby for this to occur again and again. This has never plagued my experience in the past, yet after a year or two, come back to the game and this has been my experience."
"I hate to do it but i have to.

I love Payday since PD:TH and PD2 is no exception. It was alot of Fun in 2014/15, before too much crap was added to the Game. I write this Review from my own Expression so you dont have to support it. Either you understand or not, its up to you.

[h1] Adding MTX [/h1]

One still infamous Thing the OG´s still remember. Some Peoples 9 Years ago were afraid of Overkill adding MTX to the Game with new Skins and the Safes, wich by now is an extremly bad Joke. Almir replied to the Peoples, there wont be any such Thing like MTX and it happened the next few Weeks, they actually added MTX. This made the Players understandably furious and released a huge Wave of Hackers and Cheaters in the Game and it still hits today. Peoples simply didnt care anymore and ruined the Game for others. Also you could purchase the drills for your Safes you looted (representing Lootbox) to open your Safes and you HAD to purchase them. They took it off so the Peoples who actually spend Cash on it, literally wasted it now.
Good move OVK

[h1] Update 237 [/h1]

Yes you cant talk about Payday now without mentioning the Infamous Update that broke the Game.
Like i asked for anything coming from Epic Games but yes thanks. It made the Game absolutely unplayable with even bigger Connection Issues as before. Its hard to join Matches and stay in Matches. I allready had problems getting in some Matches and actually stay but now its a Problem and im not the only one having this Issue. They managed to fix the Problems but were not successful. With the Update i couldnt connect in 9 of 10 Matches, now after the fix i cant connect in 8 of 10 Matches. Great. It also is during the Match a huge Problem. While Peoples having an attempt to connect, it just stops and doesnt progress on. Peoples in the Match are forced to wait for the poor guy to either connect or just leave or being kicked. Makes it even unfair. It doesnt seem, that OVK wants do go for another fix. Thanks.

[h1] Peer to Peer Sh!t [/h1]

I hate the Connection Type the Game uses. Instead of active Servers, everyones Computer just gets connected to each other and it can become a Problem for the Match. Its enough for one Guy to have crap Internet connection and you being dropped out of the Match. This was good and fun in 2001. Dont get me wrong, this can be good if everyone has a stable Connection and it decreases Game delays but the Chance for having a Match with everyone staying tuned is absolutely minimal. I see the Sentence ""Add Playername disconnected"" or just me being disconnected happens in almost every Match.

[h1] Bro whats with the DLC`s? [/h1]

I dont like the Way that OVK now adds so many DLC`s in the last Time. While the Game is allready told to go down because PD3 almost hits the Scene, they just keep adding alot of DLC`s now in the last 2 Years. Where they have been 8 years ago? I commonly have no Problems with DLC`s, because you dont have to buy them and most of them are cosmetics but i still have an Issue with it. Since im still going for the DSOD completion and also the special Mask of it (not finished yet) they keep adding new Heists in the mix trough DLC´s and they for whatever reason are counting for the DSOD Progression. So if i ever want to still get the Mask, i have to play the DLC Heists too so that actually forces me to buy them and this is were i draw the Line. It would be absolutely ok if the DLC Heists wouldnt have to be done too for it but yea i guess they really need my Money. Thanks again OVK.

[h1] Common Ingame Issues [/h1]

Now this Chapter of my Review is a No Brainer. I just want to recollect the Problems i see in the Game itself.

[u] Peoples dont use Pre-Match Settings [/u]
I loved the Way that the Devs added Settings to the Matches the Hosts open to clarify, if it is supposed to be
a Stealth Mission or a Loud Mission but almost no one uses it. So you often get ended up looking for a Loud Mission but you join a Match wich is supposed to be Stealth and the other way arround. It wastes Time.
This is something i dont blame the Devs for it but rather the Players.

[u] Peoples dont use the Heist Pre-Planning [/u]
Some Heists in the Game have a whole Preplanning Section, where you can add Stuff to the Heist or Change the Loot drop off Point or Escape Point. Very good i like it but again alot of Peoples are not even using that. So it happens often you join a Big Bank Heist or Golden Grin Heist, where the common Escape/Loot drop Point is over what feels like 500 Miles away while it can easily be changed via Preplanning to a closer Point.
I dont have a Problem with carrying a few Bags over 100 Metres away but it isnt Fun to carry like 20 - 30 Bags over this Distance. The Bag carrying Mechanic is ok but needs to be done right. There is a difference between a Heist that can be done in 15 - 20 Minutes and a Heist that is done in 50 Minutes (Golden Grin Moments).

[u] Wish to have more ""Only this"" Heists [/u]
Some Heists in the Game are only Stealth and some are only Loud. The Game showcases Heists with a blue Ghost Symbol as a ""Stealthable"" Heist but it doesnt make it clear if it is ONLY Stealth. Its not so comfortable for newer Players because they dont know better. Not a huge Problem but i still wish for Heists that are only Stealth and only Loud. If you fail a Stealthable Heist, you still can Progress on but only Stealth Heists just give you a Timer untill the Heist just stops and drops you back into Preperations. Some Stealthable Heists are done quicker in Loud anyway so whats the Deal? 

[u] Trollwave? [/u]
It happened to me the last 5 Years incredibly often where i join Matches but the Host kept kicking Peoples Instantly, also me. Once again pointing at the Pre-Match Settings. Their Lobbys didnt even fill up afterwards so i expect them to do that by Boredom. Some even gave perma Bans. Its extremly annoying. If they want to play alone anyway, they can make a closed Match from the Settings on but just because they dont, i might believe, they are actually Trolls and there are alot of them. Since u237 i didnt met those ""Trolls"" anymore but i guess we have bigger Problems now. Just wish there would be a better Kick/Ban Protection to prevent ""Trolls"" to just non stop kick Peoples.

[h1] Conclussion [/h1]

I complete my Review with a few last Words. Im rolling down 2022 Hours now and i still Enjoy the Game, even though there are Problems, even noticable ones but i cant walk the Path anymore without dragging Shame with me. Its after all still a good and enjoyable Game if you manage to ignore some of the Problems that happen in the Game but for now i feel like i shouldnt recommend the Game to anyone as long as OVK doesnt Change stuff. I loved the Game, where DW was still the highest Difficulty and it brought me alot of great Memorys wich PD2 definitly turns into a classified hood classic Game."
"I cant even launch the Fucking game without -steamMM and when I do I cant join other people or even people, who do do -steamMM ( through the steam interface)  . I wonder If I can still refund the game because this is ridiculous that the default is epic servers and I can only play solo when you switch back"
"Buggy, awful game that takes 100 gigs to download for no reason, and everything is locked behind a paywall to actually experience the game waste of time."
"i don't like game




too many hour."
this game made me an extremely violent criminal in real life
All of the heists are good except big oil. Fuck big oil
terrible AI
No sperm bank heist
"Payday 2 is an overall amazing game with great music, characters, etc. but after the most recent update, It has became almost unplayable in multiplayer. Public Lobbies are a 1/10 chance that you'll actually connect and be able to play the game and if for any reason you fail the heist or game bugs out you are screwed and have to try rejoining 30+ times just for it to work and then bug out again. All in all, Payday 2 is really good if you prefer the solo experience, but if you're looking for a game to play with friends, I'd suggest just to save your money for the next Payday (Which is out in September of this year)."
"It is incredibly buggy on all aspects except the menu. Multiplayer is borderline impossible on every aspect of joining lobbies. Players have attachments bug out or use a specific username are auto flagged as cheaters and are kicked from lobbies half the time. if your gonna get the game, go solo or don't at all."
"i decided ""hey i should play payday 2"" so i did
then i saw what the fuck happened to this game and decided ""Oh, i shouldnt have started NOW"" and im still playing it, god help me"
"Es divertido con amigos.

Ni tengo amigos"
I used to recommend this game mods worked perfectly. If I wanted to play the console versions I would have bought those again. I got the PC one for the mods cause who doesn't on PC games. The new updated with Epic servers methed everything up. I now do not recommend this super old ssa game to anyone that wants to jump back into it with extras cause you will have to delete most of your add ons if you wanna play online. Maybe payday 3 will be better.
NO PLAYTOYPARTING!
got rickrolled. Fuck this game.
game give me dizziness and the missions I played were too long and boring
Payday 2 shit
they ruined it
"Yeah this game is still broken for me after this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EOS integration, every person that joins my public lobbies either can't join in general, or would join and instantly get disconnected, or would sit at ""Player is joining the heist: 100%,"" but never actually join, causing me not to be able to finish the heist because the join screen is indefinitely stuck on my screen. How did y'all ♥♥♥♥ this up so badly, so late into the games life cycle? This doesn't bode well for PD3. Like, I love this game, seriously. But I've NEVER HAD THIS MANY MATCHMAKING ISSUES, CRASHES, AND OVERALL BUGS UNTIL THIS EPIC UPDATE. Really dropped the ball on this one.

Also, side note for everybody that says ""UsE -StEaMmM"" yeah that may work for public lobbies, (Granted the lobbies are about 1/10th of what you see normally because not everybody knows about this workaround.) but you literally can't join friends with that enabled. Tried with a buddy, both running -steamMM, both ON STEAM, and i invite him (once again, THROUGH STEAM.) he hits join game, and literally nothing at all happens. Great workaround everybody. Great job shoehorning Epic into this, Starbreeze. Epic has the BEST track record with caring about games and their servers, right guys!?

TLDR; Epic integration broke this game entirely, and I personally don't think they care enough to fix it with PD3 around the corner. Don't expect to have any type of MEANINGFUL online experience. Cannot recommend at this time."
The game keeps on crashing and there's clearly a lot of other problems that should be fixed and it certainly shouldn't take up almost 90gb
worst game i've ever played wtf
the virgin payday 2 vs the chad entry point
"It was a game I would recommend, probably still if you go to your advanced options and type ""-steamMM"" into the console so you can access the steam servers again. But now the main reason why I loved playing payday 2 was taken away after update 237. Crossplay ruined a big core part of the gameplay for me, many players on steam don't even know they can go back to the steam servers (probably because Overkill and Starbreeze didn't present this as an option from starting up the game), connecting to Epic Online Services is a pain in the ass, Games have trouble starting sometimes just because 1 player didn't connect to the servers properly, you can't host games with a modded client on steam so just using something like a hud mod makes your public games not appear at all, you can't find public games close by anymore so everything is worldwide (good luck doing achievements with language barriers), and worst of all Cheaters run more rampent then ever. If lootboxes in payday 2 wasn't the 9/11 of this game, Crossplay is it now. And if this shit doesn't get fixed in time for payday 3, if the online for payday 3 is going to be as shit as current payday 2 online, I am going to savior every reaction for those people who have doubted me."
"Title: Payday 2: A Heist Gone Wrong in the World of Crime

Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)

Payday 2, once touted as the ultimate heist simulator, falls short of expectations due to its outdated mechanics, repetitive gameplay, and lack of meaningful progression, resulting in a gaming experience that feels more like a chore than a thrilling criminal escapade.

One of the most glaring issues with Payday 2 is its failure to evolve and innovate since its initial release. While the game initially garnered praise for its unique premise and cooperative multiplayer gameplay, it has since stagnated, with few meaningful updates or improvements to keep players engaged. The core gameplay loop of robbing banks and completing heists feels tired and uninspired, lacking the tension and excitement that should accompany a life of crime.

The game's mechanics are also showing their age. While the basic mechanics of shooting, stealth, and teamwork are present, they feel clunky and unpolished compared to more modern shooters. Movement and gunplay lack the fluidity and precision seen in newer titles, making it difficult to pull off satisfying heists or engage in intense firefights. The lack of innovation in gameplay mechanics further contributes to the game's feeling of stagnation and irrelevance.

Moreover, Payday 2 suffers from a lack of meaningful progression or sense of accomplishment. Completing heists and earning cash rewards feels hollow and unrewarding, as success often hinges more on luck or grinding than skill or strategy. The game's progression system is heavily weighted towards grinding or paying real money to unlock new weapons, mods, and cosmetics, further cheapening the sense of achievement and satisfaction that should come from unlocking content through gameplay alone.

The game's presentation is also lackluster. While the gritty visuals and atmospheric soundtrack attempt to capture the essence of the criminal underworld, they feel dated and uninspired. Environments lack detail and atmosphere, while character models and animations are stiff and lackluster. The lack of polish and attention to detail further detract from the game's ability to create a truly immersive and engaging experience.

Furthermore, Payday 2 suffers from technical issues that disrupt the overall experience. The game is plagued by frequent bugs, glitches, and performance issues, ranging from minor annoyances to game-breaking problems. These technical shortcomings disrupt gameplay and immersion, making it difficult to enjoy the game even when it does manage to run smoothly.

In conclusion, Payday 2 is a disappointing heist simulator that fails to live up to its potential. Its outdated mechanics, repetitive gameplay, lack of meaningful progression, and technical issues make it difficult to recommend to anyone other than the most dedicated fans of the genre. With so many other cooperative multiplayer games offering more engaging and immersive experiences, Payday 2 falls short of being a worthwhile addition to your gaming library."
mid
this game bad
"Tremendous amounts of grind, most of the guns are literally shit and only a few are viable, connection randomly gets lost to friend lobbies every once in a while, AI is total garbage and the game is super poorly optimized.

And yet here I am waiting for Payday 3."
"Broken updating. Linux support dropped. Bugs everywhere.

This game has turned to absolute shit. Most of the hundreds of weapons have become useless, there's a plethora of confusing and obscure progression systems, heist objectives are extremely unclear, and you'll struggle to survive in any heist over the low-money ones unless you're playing the very strict meta (which, of course, requires expensive DLC weapons)

Payday 2 has undone everything good that Payday ever did. I have very grim hopes for Payday 3 - But, of course, you're still gonna shovel money at them, aren't you?"
game sucks fuckin balls
So fun I steal da money!
glitchy ahh fucking game
I STILL HAVENT GOTTEN MY FUCKING DLC
not working i dont like it fuck skyguy
Broke dick piece of shit game
.
"I was hoping for bank robbing, taking hostages, going stealthy, working your way out of issues.

It's just waves on enemies. There are some levels are that impossible to play stealthily and others that they make incredibly difficult, just so you have to fight cops. That wouldn't be too bad, but the combat really isn't that great.

It's fun if you have a cheat menu and a couple friends, otherwise it's not great."
good game but sold itself out to epic games
"The developers completely lost their vision of making a heist game. updates have overtime reduced PD2 into some kind of marvel tier cesspit of bloated content that killed any coherence the game had. Seriously they should have just stuck to the PD2 original 4 + hoxton, everyone else is shallow & forgettable, worst of all the huge amount of characters added meant barely any unique dialogue exists. The tone of payday has also been reduced to le whacky reddit shit with garbage like the goat simulator heist and absurd weapons (OST across heists also lacks the consistancy it had in PD1) . Game also has awful balance with many busted loadouts because of the huge amounts of weapons/skills available. To make it even worse they have recently made the game run like shit.

Honestly just play Payday The Heist if you haven't already, gameplay is massively more challenging than 2. It'll give you an idea of what Payday 2 could have been. Hopefully OVERKILL learn from their mistakes now that they have a fresh start with PD3."
"Congratulations, you managed to actually ruin the game... Post update 237 and it will never be the same again."
The vr support does not work for me am i the only one?
this shit fucking sucks lmao
Bought this game to play with my partner and it's literally unplayable. If I'd known the constant disconnecting was a known issue I wouldn't have purchased.
fuk you for ruining mods
so many bugs after 10 years of the game exist :(
Bought most of DLCs and have had a lot of fun but cant even launch the game anymore.
"Every game which will be free on epic games from steam will fall from a bike, and they done it with this game."
Mid mid mid mid mid boring spongy shooty repetitive shit
new update = cringe
no
this game makes me feel like ive been lobotomised. braindead game makes me want to shoot my friends in the back of the head for liking this poo poo ass game. 10/10 would recommend great game to start arguments with your friends. would rather play the bible on steam for 10k hours than this game for 10 more mins.
pay to win
"Matchmaking is fucked, don't bother with it right now if you're planning on playing with buddies"
The train mission is the worst thing anyone has ever created
"Was good,

Now its awful,

Greedy bastards."
"I fucking hate what they did to the game in u240.3. Why they couldn't just leave it as it is, now everything is broken and all the major changes that completely change the game are just unlisted. Do not get this game, I was right the first time. This game's golden age died out a long time ago and I doubt payday 3 is gonna ever get off the ground and above 1k players even if they gave it away for free"
great game but too unstable. One out of five games wont crash
amazing game!
"POSTING A REVIEW
PLEASE WAIT 0%"
Crashed on day 3 of the heist fuck this game
fuck starbreeze
Took away everything from my save after years of not playing come back to a completely reset fucking progression. Eat a dick
"want a game that had a game breaking alteration for servers? you've come to the right place. with 86 hours on record i can say with great confidence that the move to transition servers was one of the best f**k ups i've seen in ages. Now i can't even join a match without desync. 10/10 would not recommend, will not be investing in PD3."
"I really, really want to say you should give Payday 2 a shot. I think it's a great game, with many incredibly fun gameplay moments. However, it may have some of the worst online play I've ever seen in a modern release. The matchmaking was recently gutted in an update, which allowed Epic Games players in to Steam lobbies. Cool and all, but it completely broke functionality.

 Equally, unlike a lot of online co-op games, the ENTIRE heist is instanced to the host's computer. Host crashes? You're out however many minutes you put into the heist. They have to leave, have network issues, or just flat out ragequit? Same deal. There's no swapping hosts, which has resulted in many a lost score and XP for me. Really hope they address multiplayer in PD3, since they have a great core game on their hands."
"Would i recommend this now? hell no payday 3 is around the corner
back in 2015? hell yeah that shit was cash money"
I bought the game solely for playing Co-op but I can't play any multiplayer. This game is a scam.
"Due to update 237 implementing Epic Game Store matchmaking (and by extention breaking the game due to how poor the coding is), I can't recommend Payday 2 for anyone. You need to pay 100+ dollars on top of the legacy bundle to get the full game with all its content. Overkill has botched the game and gone back on promises repeatedly. I don't even recommend Payday The Heist because Overkill isn't deserving of any money for their shady practices and utter incompetence with update 237."
"its alright but its a dlc based game, and theres like 80 dlcs so yea no"
"Failure to join or create games, fuck epic"
"shit community and full of bugs
and why does a town with a population of 50k has 3 billion cops?"
RUBBISH
"Recently came back into the game with another 250 or so hours dipped in and hundereds of achievements gathered, you'd expect me to say something positive but no.

The reason for this is that while I love this game and the mods it provides, I cannot state the fact that the recent update completely ruined matchmaking and multiplayer experiences for many players, including myself. Hell I even have trouble of joining some of my friends games. 

People for very good reason have even created mods that deliberately kicks EOS players out cause of Epic Games servers screwing up for the Steam players. 

If you truly want to support Payday 2, don't buy it on the summer sale."
"[b]3.5[/b] out of [b]10[/b] - [u]Good gameplay, horrendous multiplayer.[/u]

There were multiple instances where I had to restart the game entirely to get it to work. Player status in the lobby (between ""ready,"" ""not ready,"" and ""joining"") was sometimes inconsistent, and my friends would be met with black screens while I was able to load into the game. On the occasion that they were actually able to join, the NPC states weren't always the same--oftentimes they'd be frozen in place for one person while an assault was ongoing for the host. 

For this reason, this is one of the last titles I would recommend for a casual game with friends."
"The multiplayer is absolutely horrendous... Steam -> Steam play matchmaking with friends only is a chore to deal with EVERY TIME. Multiple issues with syncing between players, not loading in, freezing, other players not even seeing NPCs..."
"New updates are ass, should just wait for Payday 3 :,( Not even the summer sale makes this game worth buying."
"Update 237 makes multiplayer almost impossible to do now. It's been about a month and the issue still hasn't been resolved. It's basically unplayable in it's current state since multiplayer is where the majority of the fun is, and it's hard to have fun when connecting takes ages and then crashes while you're joining, and when you start a heist, and while you're playing, and pretty much all the time. Don't buy it until they fix it, enough said.

PS. Good fucking luck if you use Linux, it's been officially abandoned at this point even though it claims to still support it."
"Lost all my progress again because I reinstalled the game, because it wouldnt launch. I am pissed"
This game is for transexual homoerotic sissies who like BBC
Epic intagraeting fucked up matchmaking.. and broke things.. have to use launch aunments to get back to steam matchamking and even that don't fix everthing. so big fat NOPE.
doesnt fucking load
"Online is broken, this is due to EOS implementation for EGS cross-play being done poorly.  Either way, terrible experience, not even worth $1 if you intend to play with friends."
"great game all around, but allot of things are locked behind dlc..."
"Please, fix your game and unrelease from epic thanks"
"what have they done i can not play this game 
i did play it but now it just wont open and i would like some help 
can someone please explain to me why this game wont open i have tried everything to play this again 
but nothing works 
i love starbreeze best company since china"
cross play sucks

"A very enjoyable game with many glaring issues. The cost of entry is quite steep for new heists, the legacy collection is pretty good value and includes the majority of the best heists. The engine is really showing it's age from being pushed to its limits after 10 years, lots of crashes and annoying issues. Now has lots of server issues due to being forced to use Epic Online Services. Would give this a neutral review if I could. The game is fun and can still be enjoyed but a lot of their recent decisions feel pretty bad. I really hope that Payday 3 will be a fresh start and will be built upon a more stable foundation."
the game is good but everyone seems to really suck so it makes the team based maps impossible to play because this world is filled with literal idiots that buy a game and then have no idea how to play
"I have been a PD2 beta player in 2013 when it was released for beta and played when first launched for 150hrs . It was fine there and then , then came the dlcs after dlcs followed by the microtransaction debacle.
When i just started to play again on 1st Jul , with EGS having PD2 and thinking of buying the dlcs in bulk at $5 .
Guess what , Its unplayable now when combining with Epic Games PD2 lobbies , something about steam matchmaking was screwed after combining with Epic Games . 
To make things worse , i had so bad latency with my friends that i have a different phase from them . Eg . Us on a First World Bank Heist , they were already in escaping phase while i was still collect and grab the money phase.

It is recommended not to buy this game till they fix it . Cant believe it went to shit , from PD:the heist to PD2 then lastly worst in PD3 . 
Never going to buy PD3 as i have lost hope in the Overkill in a whole"
Too much dlc
"Ok, so I love this game. It's an incredibly fun horde shooter with great progression via the perks and skills to make unstoppable builds to fight the cop menace. But dear god, does this game have two blaring flaws. First, Starbreeze seems to be doing everything in it's power to break this game into a limbo of unplayability, and Second, most of the fun you derive from this game is roughly tens to hundreds of dollars of dlc. True, that isn't much of a problem recently, due to deals on the edition that basically gives you every dlc, but still, if a game needs dlc to actually be played in a fun way, then that's just not a game. Can't wait for Payday 3, though. It looks cool. Would just save up for that game instead. (Game sucks, Payday 2 is sadly still better)"
used to love the game but somehow they have broken the game recently actually crushed honestly. really wanna just play the game with mates but only run onto problems wtf did they do to ruin the game yikes. would recommend if game worked cos gameplay its a great game but now its just a broken mess.
This game's online is janky af now.
Ruined with update
Don't buy this now.  Since epic online services were implemented multiplayer is pointless.  Half the time you can't even join properly.  The other half you get stuck loading on a day 2 and have to restart if you are working your way through the career
"Thumbs down until they fixed the EOS integration issues and hosting-related crashes. Though with PD3 coming, I doubt they'll fix it."
playing with friends isn't fun
game just don't launch for some reason triied everything and it just don't even open a window when i click play
"Just mind boggling how in 2 updates im literally unable to start the game. Before, i could play it just fine, lobbies aplenty. 20-30 player lobbies all day everyday it seemed. Then the Update. Id see 5-10 player lobbies if im lucky. Also to mention, connection issues, it was problematic before the update. After just made it 10 times worse, felt like a gamble every time. Will i connect? Will i disconnect mid way through the game? Will i get kicked? Who knows, as im writing this, as i said i literally cant load for more than 5 seconds before the game crashes. Had fun with the game but i guess thats coming to an end. feels bad man"
ok game but they to MANY GOD DAMN DLC like you need dlc to use most thing in the game like i already 15 dollar to have stuff behind a pay wall
Every update breaks the game. It's quite annoying
Too few achievements
no for vr same shit over and over again  it sucks
Update 278 ruined the whole game
"This game is very fun with friends, I enjoy playing this with all of my buddies when we be heisting on them banks and sht yk what i mean dawg"
"since the last update the game's servers have become completely unusable, and hard crashes are extremely common. massive fucking shame since at any other point in the game's lifespan i would have gladly recommended it wholesale as it's really fun."
">84 gigs
>made in unreal engine
fun but leaves something to be desired in movement and gun play, left 4 dead is better."
"I just can't give this a good review with the random crashes in the middle of heists. It'll happen maybe once every 10 or 15 heists but, when it's in the middle of a crime spree and you lose 7 or 8 heists in, over a crash, it's unacceptable. I've also had tons of weird glitches like the bots just stop shooting people halfway through a heist and now I'm on my own for the rest or times where I'm doing stealth and one bot just walks around, following me the entire heist. OVERKILL is spending too much time making high priced DLCs and not enough time fixing their game."
"I love this game, played it on console for many years but the lack of support led me to play this on PC but as much as I love the game, the constant network issues that revolve around either constant disconnects or not able to even start a mission when everyone is clearly on ready.

shame that this game is in this state and I dont know if they'll ever fix it because of Payday 3 releasing."
not gud
"gmae was good, and i had it prefect......but then the devs got greedy and starterd to release a bunch of BS DLC, lets see how much of a trash fire the 3rd one is :/. only buy this game if its onsale and with a DLC pack,"
i wanted to say every argument but i am lazy so all i want to say is that this is trash and you better give away your 7 dollars rather than buying this shit
"OLD TIMES :nice cool game, very interesting, amazing, many weapons, cool missions, many items, awesome story, NICEEEEE!! SUPER FUN!! ---- SADLY THIS WAS BEFORE.


NOW: the game was cool, but sadly now i cant play with friends, to join with friends is a pain, sometimes cant join, and the game explode.  VERY DISAPOINTED .

to play with friends you need a code. A CODE THAT MANY TIMES,  ALMOST ALWAYS, NEVER WORKS.... VERY BAD DONE!!! 

this is a sad moment. A good game that was a lot fun, now it is broken."
"devs made an update that added crossplay with epic games store players but made the connection way worse, broke steam invites and took down linux support"
Update 237
"Epic games servers ruined the game. Literally cannot join freinds games and when you do, you get kicked from the lobby."
"The game is good if you are willing to fight against the bugs espatially if you want to play with friends.

DO NOT buy this game if it is not on sale, it goes on sale to around 80% if you want to pick a bundle the legacy bundle is the best value for your money for a lot of play time."
"Really?
On the last update you decide to fuck over the Steam and Linux users? for EPIC of all the useless platforms?

Just go to hell i'm done. PD3 looks bad and so you screw over PD2 to boost the sales huh?"
would not reccoemnd
"Can we appreciate how much effort epic games put into making Payday 2 lobbies glitchier than normal, thank you epic games"
dont buy it to laggy for my shit box
"really not fun, confusing and i fallowed instructions and now i have a life sentence in jail"
"This was a really good game and if they did not completely abandon payday 2 it would still be a very good game. Now, you can barely join into a heist with your friends, and god forbid you need to restart the heist bc now at least one person will need to leave and come back because the servers wont load. Now its to the point that for some of the heists, the objectives will not load into the game."
breakin feds
it's boring as hell after a while
"Can't smooth turn in-game, only 45 or 90 degree turns with a fade in and out black screen.

Nah I'm good thanks."
Fuck Epic for ruining yet another game.
"With update 237, they decided to drop Linux support and ruined the multiplayer by moving the online services from Steam to Epic Games' trash."
"Went from my favorite game to shit in record time
Not buying Payday 3 with the way things are going now"
"yes sure the guns are good, but the game its self is pretty ass, if you like stealth in games then don't play this unless your a god at it, the game is hard and all in all just not enjoyable, the difficulty to the impossible stealth I hate this game, you have to be really good at it if you want to play it, I hope this helped people."
Remove the Epic Spyware from our game
"It's almost impossible to reliably play online anymore, very cool"
literally unplayable until matchmaking gets fixed
"I absolutely love this game, but following Update 237, I cannot recommend it until the issues it has caused are fixed. Many are suffering from horrendous match-making, but I and plenty of others are unable to even start the game.

I have uninstalled all mods (as instructed), validated the game files (as instructed) twice, and even uninstalled and reinstalled the game, yet it still doesn't start.

Until I am able to do something as basic as boot up the game, this review will remain negative, regardless of how much I would normally recommend."
"End of support with badly implemented EOS was fucking mistake.
Some of troubles:
- Some mods dead, some mods crashing
- Invites not working for me 90% of time without any modes, or netcode is dead with modes (everyone ready - game isn't starting, peoples loaded on heist, but there have no connection to host, mission etc.)
- Save file corruption (luckely not for me)

P.S.
Really wanted to end with game with positive review, because i really liked this game, i had fun with friends, i have DSOD achievement, but whatever done is done. Hoping on fixes from devs, maybe will change my review.
P.P.S.
-steamMM fixed for me all bugs. My friend joined via CrimeNet, hosted on public. There are also fixed glitch, when friend is connected, but network freezing for him."
no sex DLC
cant play with my friends anymore and playing this game alone or with random is just ass.
"The Game is really good. 

But to much DLC"
"I don't like that the game i initially purchased (which happens to be the first ever game i got on Steam) has transformed into a sequel and is essentially not the game i initially bought.

Now I know that *technically* i didn't purchase the game but a license to it, meaning i'm ""not allowed"" to have a cry about it cause i knew the terms and conditions beforehand, but I'd be remiss in not acknowledging my frustration with it. It's bullshit."
"Just the same complaints as everyone else.

- Hostage/Team AI pathing is still as broken as fuck as it was on release (really? literally hundreds of updates but you guys can't figure out how to make a working npc pathing system, team AI will run out into the open and get downed instantly which is extremely frustrating and hostages will just refuse to follow you)
- Some maps were clearly untested before release and still haven't been improved (Brooklyn 10-10 is a perfect example as snipers will just straight up shoot you through walls, some of Locke's missions have guards walk straight through walls and doors like they don't exist).
- Stealth for the most part is fun, however the issue of pathing comes up again as guards will walk around in some of the most awkward and unnatural ways possible (walking backwards, getting stuck in animation cycles so they will just sit there and not move), after a while it takes you out of stealth and doesn't really keep you wanting to come back to those maps.
- Skills and perk decks are mostly fine and tuned really well... until whenever Overkill brainlessly adds another perk deck that invalidates all the ones before it by being the most OP shit I've ever seen (remember when Stoic was first added? It wasn't even the first time that happened LMAO)
- Some of the DLC content is just straight up scams, some are just recycled maps and assets from the main game with a new coat of paint slapped on it (It's so obvious at times that I literally see they took the warehouse from Election Day [day 2] placed it in Border Crossing and called it a day. Not to mention the other heist, Border Crystals, using the EXACT SAME FUCKING MAP but it's just Cook Off and with Locke voicing over instead of Bain. To charge money for what was essentially a repainted map is a fucking scam and Overkill should be embarrassed to even have the audacity to attempt that).
- The Epic Game Store (EGS) update completely broke the game making online play pretty much impossible and buggy. You can't actually copy and send the codes of your lobbies to send to friends making the entire system pointless. It wouldn't be an issue if the codes were short enough to quickly read them out to a friend over discord but instead they are paragraph long lines of mumbo jumbo. Imagine trying to get friends to join your lobby and having to read out what is essentially an elongated WiFi password every time. The whole update seemed to be rushed and just completely untested. Really not a good look for new players when they can't even play online.

Because of these gripes as well as the scummy treatment of this game from Starbreeze/Overkill, I can't legitimately recommend this to anyone without caveats. That being said I hope these issues are limited to this game only as Payday 3 looks to be very promising with the engine upgrade. If not, Starbreeze better be ready to go under because no one will stick around for this game anymore."
Dogwater devs
This was an amazing game when it came out. It quickly became a money grab scheme.
Remove Epic Games
Literally cannot copy and paste the required lobby codes to play with friends using a controller. It only works with KBM. Cannot invite Steam friends through Steam either. Not worth the hassle.

"Worst game ever,bad gameplay and unfun missions.Only plebs and slop enjoyers will like this."
no sex
Not interested
Can't even play online now although my internet is completely fine and files are not corrupted.
this fucking game not open 2 hour ı am going postal and broke my computer
shit game with shit matchmaking since u237. used to work like a charm and now me and my friends are crashing every 5 minutes with the heist restart mechanics and bodies are in completely separate places for each client instead of the p2p matchmaking of the game being stable. -steamMM is buggy and broken and is only meant to be a temporary solution for the problems steam players are facing and overkill and starbreeze are probably not going to make separate matchmaking for those who opt in. loved this game before the egs integration bullshit and now i can barely stand playing a simple shadow raid with a crew of 3.
"I love this game to death, and will probably pre order pd3,

Cmon, you can't just ruin this right before the next one comes out, its not like efforts going to be put into this game once payday 3 comes out, I planned on playing both until the end of time, I can't even open it :("
"Was playing this on release with friends and it was a cool game. Then dlcs start popping up, after first game i was thinking cool, more support for the product that i like, but after 10th dlc i stop buying them. Then they start sell weapons, skins, maps and music separately. Then they start to make bundles of dlcs. Then you can preoder dlc... Its gone insane...

Mod community was grate, a lot of cool mods that can make game a lot more interesting. But with every big update 50-70% just stop working and players have to wait until modmakers update them. And with some updates developers appropriate some mode ideas and alot of mode makers (especially with the hude) just give up.

Performance/optimisation with every new map got worse and worse. Maps was more and more less uniq and just more more recycling the assets... Music stay cool but developers doesn't make the music, they just choose/buy/licence it.

And now we at the point when they (devs/publisher) make cross play with epic game store and all my friend who still playing this game (i give up long ago) say that all mods just not working and game by it sellf barly playble with even save file corruption possibility.

With what they do to poor payday 2 and looking at other projects from starbreeze/overkill, have a little to no hope( if any) for payday 3. Music probably gona be cool tho!"
update 237 broke the game. eos sucks.
update 237 broke the game lol
"In the modern gaming industry, it really seems like a trend to broke and destroy older games with added third party crap. The new update replaced the peer to peer matchmaking with epic games servers which broke the multiplayer for many, it made the game drop native linux support, and the mods were broken by it. And for what? for a crossplay feature that literally nobody asked? for the insanely small amount of epic game users? and forcing players through epic game's service which is infamous for data collection without giving the option for the older matchmaking. And the devs couldn't do more than just simply lying on top of their past lies in every single of their news update. i hope it's worth it for them to ruin a 10 year old game that is literally at the end of it's life circle and dropping linux support for this..."
"bought the game before eBic games make it free to keep for one week and it's worse. hosts just leave the game way too often(loud heists as well). i wish i could wait a bit longer and get it for free on eBic games. it just no, as steam user, and payday 2 enjoyer."
Game constantly crashes mid heist
"Look man, I heard they changed the servers to epic for crossplay or some shit. I've seen crossplay integration kill like 5 games I liked by ruining the servers they gotta cut the shit. At least payday 3 is out soon"
"Game is fine, it's actually amazing!
But with the introduction of Epic Games serves, Steam servers have collapsed in on themselves and are hardly functioning. Why does a 10 year old steam game suddenly need to go to Epic? Good question.

Buyer beware, there is no easy way to buy the OVER 80 DLC. All provide some gameplay difference except the suit skins, which aren't even that good. Almost every heist DLC is worth it, though anything after White House, Nov. 2018, is kinda shit. Context: Starbreeze announced the end of development for Payday 2 after the release of the White House heist and subsequent end of the story. They would then go to finish The Walking Dead to critical failure, leaving them no option but to crawl back to Payday 2. The first dlc sold poorly because the community essentially said ""this is garbage, we expect better."" While the ones afterwards are ""fine,"" they're still worse than almost every Pre-White House heists. 

With all DLC, this game is over 90gigs. And with EGS servers, this game is breaking down and people are leaving. Either Starbreeze will get their shit together (unlikely) or multiplayer will die. Don't get me wrong though, this game is still a blast solo. EVERYTHING that can be done in multiplayer can be done in single player, so you won't miss anything. Except maybe a lot of cheaters and hosts kicking you because they still haven't figured out how to make a private lobby. 

Buy for the single player, hope Starbreeze gets a brain transplant and gets rid of EGS servers. 
Also you can cook meth as John Wick with Sicario, Scar face, and Jacket from Hotline Miami while fighting off hordes of police."
"Just one of those days that EGS woke up and decided to save the world again, but messed up everything as usual with their cursed money. Please remove this game from Steam. Go grab money somewhere else. You don't deserve any respect or support here anymore. Hope EGS bribe money worth it all."
"game broken :(
wait to buy until they said it fixed again"

"Great game to play with the boys but for gods sake remove epic games, literally makes the game unplayable."
"Bought the game for my friend im gonna run the story with him then the secret then im uninstalling forever fuck epic games 


2015 but worse"
ever since the newest update i'm unable to play with any of my friends and we tried multiple times to fix the problem but it doesn't work the only time we can play is by ourselves especially when we try to play in vr it's the same problem can't play with our friends
not my cup of tea
.
"MY SAVED GAMES AND ALL PROGRESS ALL GONE,LIKE WHAT THE F IS GOIN ON !!"
"Game was fun around launch and the first year. Mountains of DLC and paying for skins with stats turned me off from playing further, but now with EOS forcibly integrated I can't play it at all.

Absolutely scummy decision by a faceless company abusing its customers. I'm never going to buy anything else from Overkill, and I strongly recommend not to buy this game either. Whether you buy anything else from them is up to you."
"The game was great, but the Epic bribe money ducked the game. :)"
not interested really ...
"Epic Game Store and their forced Epic Online Services strikes again.

After 10 years of the game working great, they decided to swap to a laggier, buggier and just generally worse service - Epic Online Services - in order to receive EGS Bribes/to hand the game out for ""free"" on EGS.



Launch the game with the parameter ""-steamMM"" to return to the stable SteamWorks that was used for the past 10 years."
"I love PD2, just boycotting Epic Games. They've ruined countless games for me, and here we go again. Way to ruin an old installment just before releasing PD3."
trash
"Game was good, now so much is broken all because the devs wanted bribe money from epic.... it was fun while it lasted. Payday will never be the same."
"ooga booga rob a bank ooga booga
i take it back, i did bloody grinch with a friend, they got the achievement, i did not. I want to die, ooga booga robbing isnt fun anymore"

"As of update 237, no longer functions. When you do manage to actually join a match, player is stuck in a ghost state. It's like I'm in my own instance separate from the host. Guards and cameras don't see me, doors I open aren't open for others, can't revive or activate objectives, civs or guards I shoot aren't dead for others. On their screen, I'm unmoving stuck in spawn, sometimes as a different character. 

Completely, radically broken. What did yall do?"
The latest update makes it no longer playable. It consistently desyncs already in the lobby and if you actually manage to start a game your teammates are standing at the spawn doing nothing and softlocking the game since they can neither do objectives nor can they even die.
They dropped the linux support.
"Newest update has caused all sorts of dsync issues. Disappearing medkits, frozen police AI, objectives not progressing at the same pace as other players. Hate how I come back to this game I love after a few months and now it's actually unplayable"
They ruined it.
"I loved payday 2.

i got into payday 2 after watching tones of videos about it so when the game went on sale i bought it and had the time of my life playing the first few heists.  A couple of weeks ago i decided to reinstall and play the game again and after setting my mods up i started to feel the same joy i felt when i first played. 
Then one day i could no longer open payday 2. i thought it was something on my end so i reinstalled the game, still didn't work. i did some research into my problem and found that the 237 update was stopping me from playing the game.  
I'm annoyed because i just want to play this game more yet overkill's choices wont let me.
please overkill. somehow just fix your shit without digging your hole deeper.
pre update 237 score: 8/10
post update 237 score: 0/10 because I cant even play the game.


UPDATE: i got the game working again but i had to uninstall all my mods otherwise the game crashes within 30 seconds. I'm not going to say ""Literally unplayable"" but i'm still disappointed."
"The Steam Version is dead, no linux compatibility anymore, VR doesnt work, dependent on Epic Game Store servers to play and in no way a funcioning game, report it to steam support. Ironically enough, Starbreeze robbed us, they had their Payday"
"Overkill the devs for Payday have ruined the game by swapping the online services to Epic Game stores trash servers. 

Game no longer works and when it does, it runs worse."
"GREAT GAEM
!"
2/10
"I don't care what others say but i find it so fucking hilarious and i quote ""PAYDAY 2 will finally spread its wings and soar to a new PC platform"" and they removed linux support like wtf hahaha that isn't adding that is removing
God that made me laugh so hard"
"played 1 mission and had alot of fun with my friend. Then we spent 45 mins or so trying to get into a lobby again together. twice we did that and honestly its kinda sad cause the game seemed fun, but their be more fish in the sea."
Newest update litterally broke my game lmao
"Used to be good, but they ruined the game eventually. No game that gets EOS survives."
Keeps crashing new update kill the matchmaking/servers. Cant even join my friends
"Yea this game was great prior to update 237, now it barely works.
Another game lost to Epic and greed I guess."
Linux support is gone. Can't play it anymore.
"Quantity over quality. More is not always better.

The good: 
The technical execution of the game. Graphics, sound, performance, stability, interface - all satisfactory. There are games with better technical execution, but what we have here is enough.
Initially the game seems to be a fun shooter.

The bad:
Too many DLCs.
The developers tried to make about guns and gun play by adding so many guns in the game, however gun enthusiasts might be left unhappy with the gun characteristics being SO FAR from reality. Dear developers, if you make a game about guns, FFS at least read about these guns on Wikipedia, it's free and accessible to everyone.

The ugly:
Too many enemies. They crawl like locusts, like ants from everywhere, they're not smart, not challenging about them beside their numbers, they spawn too often, with only a few seconds between the waves. Engaging them is not worth it half of the time, you kill a few behind you only so more can spawn ahead of you where you need to go. Battalions of enemies make it feel like the game is not about criminals but about all-out global war, killing the immersion.
Repetitive fetch missions: Collect the valuable items from another store, bring them to the van. Rinse. Repeat. Mow down another legion of ""locusts"".
The best missions are the ones from Payday 1. Payday 1 was better in any aspect: well-directed missions, actual tactical combat.
The game becomes annoying after a few hours of total gameplay, it feels like chore: go on, grind another dozen bags from a store, another few hundreds of mindless cop bots.

There is quote to decribe the game
""Trite, contrived, mediocre, milquetoast, amateurish, infantile, cliche-and-gonorrhea-ridden paean to conformism, affront to humanity, war crime, should *literally* be tried for war crimes, lacking in imagination, uninformed reimagining of [Payday: The Heist], limp-wristed, premature, ill-informed attempt at [copying Payday: The Heist], savagely boring, just one repulsive laugh after another."""
"Sold out their Linux players for Epic Game's money.  :(  
I guess I shouldn't be surprised, coming from a company that charges players for every update.

RIP Payday, you will be fondly remembered."
"THERE IS SH*T ALL OVER MY ROOM BECASE OF HOW HARD AND CONFUZING THIS GAME IS :(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
THIS GAME IS WANK"
Its just not for me
"Utter trash: Main reason connection issues, i never used to have problems playing online, joining games, hosting games etc.
Ever since the Epic Update, nope, im lucky if one out of a hundred games will actually work, 90% of the time its due to someone in the lobby (even the host) stuck as joining or just straight up failed to join.
Tried this on multiple networks AND even mobile data and it has the exact same issue.
Like I said used to work fine, now just sucks ass."
fuck this game shlomit
i just dont know what to do
"After years of playing this game, It's officially reaching its end of life. I used to love this game but after overkill marking me as a cheater for having old mask packs, and now completely destroying the steam matchmaking and focusing Epic's servers, I've lost a place for this game. It used to be amazing with friends, and even with good/bad memories it was something for me to play for years on end. Now it's finally time to put it to rest. I fear what 3 may hold seeing as it's built on Unreal and most likely going to be manipulated by Epic at this rate. Thank you old Overkill and Starbreeze for the times way back then, but I can't hold out hope for this game anymore. After seeing dlc being spat out at rapid fire, and a terrible anti-cheat system, I'm done. I'm sad to not be able to recommend this game anymore but it is, what it is.

Here lies PAYDAY 2

Update 0.1 - Update 237"
"im no like it,,,. me and my friend was playinf ir was fine unrill tje game dusconetct me from the server and i goer gery ander so im dayibg rhis hniw do nor gfert this gamne,

0/10


Edit: Me and my fridns try to play and one frind try everything but it no let us play frick this game"
Boring.
not fun and to buggy
Spyware
ass
I got this game so I could play with my friends and enjoy my time. It was fun for a while but I can't exactly play with my friends now can I. One update to make the game free on epic games and make it crossplay and it all didn't work on steam.
Had fun for a long time then updates just prior to payday 3 came out. I havent played this game as much as the true veterans but with almost 300 hours dont play this or pay the huge amount to play. the servers and changed almost daily so cant play with friends (whole point of playing) and now the whole online doesnt work in general. Plus people try joining your game crash it causing you to loose all progress. this game once was fun but of course greed struck another company. sad to see another somewhat good company fail their long loving fans.
"very slightly fun, but more like just a bit entertaining... for like 20 minutes or so.  then boredom kicks in.  i wouldn't recommend it, but that's just me."
"Unplayable, every time I try to join my friends its either stuck on loading screen, either says failed to connect or just generally bugged 4 players in 5 player appears, cuz the original player is standing still at the same spot"
Shit
still unplayable w/ friends since epic games crossplay update.
"No, I don't like it. Pointless.."
"The game has been ruined by bad management, questionable development, and downright laughable community management. 

One of the recent updates to Payday 2 integrated their server system into the Epic Game Store. They said this wouldn't affect steam players, and they said this wouldn't affect the game in the long run. As of these updates, it is now almost impossible to find lobbies anymore. The game runs worse, server integrity is as bad as it can get, crashes are frequent, and the game somehow runs the worst it ever has in over 10 years of development. And with the most recent updates, save files have been getting corrupted, and people are loosing their savefiles permanently. This game has turned into a joke. A laughing stock, and a text-book case of how to not develop a game. Every update that's pushed out in a desperate attempt to save face, results in the game breaking down even harder. It's a house of cards that can't keep itself up anymore, and the game has fallen into a state of complete and utter breakdown. 

This EGS merger didn't have to happen. It has done nothing but break the game beyond repair, which goes to show how there truly is no limit to corporate greed. You don't know if the game will be playable tomorrow. If your savefile will still be there. If the game will corrupt or brick your PC. Every update is a coin toss, and the devs haven't been lucky so far.

Fix the game, remove the EGS cross-play, and let the game rest. It isn't worth ruining a decade long legacy in the making, only for a few worthless good boy points from Epic Games."
"This game is actually very good if you ignore the money hungry incompetent developers, the constantly coping community and the gameplay and the difficulty scaling and the story and the 10k DLCs and your own freewill.

edit: I also forgot the infamy 0 level 2 randoms who join your public death sentence one down stealth heist alert the whole map then ask if you could change it to bank: deposit on normal."
"I don't mind Epic Games, if someone likes this platform to play or to release games.
Just make sure it doesn't causes troubles to others. Let them choose who can join their game (enable/prevent players from other platforms maybe).
After your update my steam Payday 2 doesn't work anymore. I can't even launch it."
"10 years and all you can do is make the game run worse, truly a feat

after an entire summer, multiple ""fixes"" and looking up everything online, the game still refuses to launch
bravo, cant wait for payday 3 to run like a semi truck hitting an orphanage!"
fix crimespree
"Imagine breaking the matchmaking and other features 10 years after release just to get some players from the epic shit store, oh and also Linux support is dead, it's crazy how anything that epic touches, excluding unreal engine, ends up being trash, it really is the cancer of PC gaming.

Use -SteamMM save yourself some sanity."
"They completly ruined Multiplayer with the introduction of EOS, which is quite frankly hot garbage."
"I've thought a lot about this and I've decided that I'm going to have to go thumbs down on this one, which is a shame because there's actually a decently fun game buried somewhere underneath this disgustingly buggy pay to win grindfest. I'll keep this one brief but basically the monetization model makes no sense for this game. Every once in a while they make new weapons that you have to buy with real world money and they just won't stop doing it. Making players pay actual money for upgrades in a videogame is stupid! I get that if you go ahead and make a whole new map that I have to pay extra for that because it's like bonus content or whatever, and I like that only one player in your party needs to own a DLC level for you to be able to play it, but I just can't excuse the rest of it. On top of that they use scummy tactics such as delisting some of the DLC so that you only have a limited time to buy it before it goes away FOREVER. It is not worth playing this game anymore and Payday 3 is probably going to be more of the same. You have to shell out so much cash for access to the good loadouts that it's not even funny."
DLC
A shell of its former self
"They fucking ruined it.
God damnit"
"EOS matchmaking is a fucking joke, good job epic games, you guys successfully ruined this game."
"90% of the game now is either playing solo or ""failed to join session"". untill they fix it its not worth it."
Less than mid
Just wanted to come back to this after a few years of not playing the game to say that since OVK has taken the EPIC money and fucked the game for everyone who isnt a epic shill. 237 is what payday 3 will likely turn out to be.
Repetitive and awkward. The best thing about this game is that its soundtrack is available as a mod for Deep Rock Galactic
"Reinstalled after a long, long break to see if there were any signs of Overkill taking this game in a better direction before Payday 3 comes out. Greeted with there being over twice as many DLCs to buy, laggy servers, broken matchmaking, corrupted saves, broken mods, crashes, disconnects, people being flagged as cheaters for having too many DLCs and/or owning certain weapons/mods... 

....yeah, I think I'll pass on that sequel."
This game is a nightmare to run every time I just want to play the game I need to uninstall and re download it after every update go to YouTube its 2023 and they are still having glitches appear now the game wont launch I swear these people are just as bad as Bethesda.
"I played this game once, didn't like. Now Steam won't stop making recommendations based on it. It's infuriating. I've tried removing it from my account, didn't stop it. Now I hate this game way more than it deserves. Still not great"
"Thanks to the g̶r̶e̶e̶d̶ brilliance of devs deciding that moving the match making servers from Steam to epic was the way to make this game even more fun, I now can't connect to my friend's games."
Not worth playing at all until they fix the matchmaking issues since 6/7/2023.

"Can't believe this happened. PAYDAY 2 free on epic store? For a WEEK?
Overkill, u know that u fucked your own game by doing that?

I used to like this game, but after this bullshit, bruh, No Thanks.
I'm still playing this game, because i'm waiting for PD 3, but nah.

Connection problems, failed to join, no more good DW or DS lobbys, sometimes it shows 0 of them. 
Now it's just nerds playing (sorry) but this is just so bad, new players, normal diff lobbys, and most important More CHEATERS. Actually, there's MORE than more cheaters, like, in every lobby. 

Now how i'm playing this game is... with friends and other payday 2 players that i know, and it's all good. Sometimes shit happens when i'm trying to join them, but it's not that bad as lobby searching. I don't even want to talk about that update lol.

So long story short, this game is fucked, even payday 3 is coming, i kinda lost my hype for it because of this bullshit.
and yes, new players, epic nerds.. Don't join DW or DS lobby (EVEN IF IT'S STEALTH) because y'all annoying, watch some tutorials on Youtube or something when u UNDERSTAND THIS GAME MECHANICS. The OG players are abandoning this game, there will be no good side of this game, this is the END, and thanks to Epic Games for destroying this game.

""ngl this the biggest comment i've ever writed, it's not fun anymore bruh, wtf overkill is even thinking"""
dead game
"The game is broken and will no longer launch for me, now as the only game in my steam library i can't play."
"one of my favorite games just no longer launches, nice one guys"
THIS GAME IS SO AWFUL I CANT FATHOM HOW AWFUL AND TRASH THE GAME ISFROM THE MALIGNANT GAURDS TO THE DOG SHIT SYSTEMS FOR BEING DETECTED LITTERALY I GET DETETCED WHEN MY CHARCTERS BAWLZ ARE SLIGHTLY OUT TRASH DOSGHIT GAME
The devs broke a 10 year old game with an update that was entirely motivated by profit. Multiplayer is now largely unplayable with no fix documented. Do not support these people in taking more money from the community with their bad practices. Look forward to these issues never being resolved as the devs disappear with the release of payday 3.
"Fuck update 237 it kinda destroyed the game i played this game a lot on steam and even the ps3 versions there were a lot of bugs before but this fucked everything Epic games is a plague only for a few extra players that probaby be bored asf after a few days without buying the dlcs 
i lost all the respect for the creators of this game and i wont buy payday3"
"This is a steam game, and I can't go online because EOS is down. This sucks."
"Since the Epic Crossplay was introduced, I have not been able to play with my friends at all and sometimes failed to play online at all. Randoms either being locked in the joining screen or me being the one locking them in one, no way for the host to kick or leave until the person joining leaves first. About 1/3 of all online games that I have played had this issue and I will keep this review up until they fix it. 

Great game apart from the recent issues."
"When your connection to the host fails, you automatically lose the entire heist and all the time put into it."
"I tried to get a online game running with 2 friends and this is a list of errors we encountered:

- Unable to join lobby
- Unable to join already running games
- Players randomly disconnecting from lobby
- Game doesn't start, even if all players are ready
- Not all players from lobby that are ready get into the game. Some stuck in Lobby.
- Blackscreen after gamestart (Inifinite Loading)
- Lobby Invites are missing
- Random Game crashes

Every lobby recreation drains the bank account. After a few attempts nobody in my group had enougt money to setup a job anymore.

I hope devs do better with Payday 3."
"f*ck epic games!
GET BACK STEAM NETWORK API !
* Most mods is broken or cause bugs and crashes in game.
* Even without mods! Lobbies works terrible, either I can’t join someone, or people can’t come into my lobby or if they can, they have black screen. I am sure that most of the problems are related to the new network code from Epic Games.
* They stop Linux support! I'm sure they did it because Epic Games didn't want to make their network API library for Linux! They are not Linux friendly."
"They broke it, and im not buying the 3rd game till this is fixed, just goes to show that Overkill doesnt really care about its community IE lemme break my cash cow right before our next game comes out in hopes the players from 2 with all its bloated content to get on 3 with its bare bones launch. spent way to much money on this just to have somebody break it. never again overkill."
no way they keep pushing back this release date and wont even work on making this game functional.. its obvious their priorities are not us.
"Absolute trash, the game is bugyy as hell, security officers notice you through walls and ring the alarms. also there is absolutely no intructions as to what is todo, in the2 first mission where you have to rob the car dealership, there is no instructions as to how to get the manager to give you the key card or where you have to go..

ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT GAME, DO NOT BUY!!!"
"Me and my friends redownloaded this game in anticipation of payday 3, little did we know the update from 5 days ago made it so buggy that games with friends straight up don't work. Literally unplayable"
game bad
"Yeah, no, I can't in good faith recommend this game anymore.

Payday 2 is an amazing game and for the price of it, and for how often it's on sale, it genuinely provides a good bang for it's buck, with hundreds of hours of content. Back when I didn't have much money to spend on games, this was an absolute godsend due to it's seemingly endless amounts of content. But that's when the game works.

Despite saying that PD2 will no longer receive updates, and even announcing a final update before the launch of PD3, Starbreeze have been updating the game still without any announcements, re-balancing things that didn't need re-balancing, and overall just making unnecessary adjustments. Perhaps when they meant not receiving updates they meant no new content, and only bug fixes, but these secret updates have brought in a myriad of bugs into the game, a Youtuber called Marcmb documents a lot of the bugs, and I'm just highlighting some particularly noteworthy ones.

One of the bugs is Stealth breaking, the NPCS in stealth can be frozen now permanently, which can potentially, if unlucky, softlock a heist, this bug has completely changed stealth, as it only hurts the honest player who wants to play the game as intended, and it only strengthens the people wishing to take advantage of exploits, and this bug, when exploited, makes some of the hardest stealth maps completely trivial. One of the two ways of playing the game (stealth or loud) just doesn't work as intended anymore, which is peachy, it's also worth mentioning that spawn patterns for Loud are bugged aswell and they don't work as intended anymore so both methods of play are bugged in some fundamental way (although loud is a lot less noticeable and a lot more manageable than stealth's bugs)

Another particularly annoying bug is a very recent one, the community item bug. In PD2 there are some weapons, masks and a few other bits and bobs that you get from either joining the PD2 steam group, or making a starbreeze account. Multiple people, including me, have logged onto the game just to find those items getting removed, this wouldn't be a particularly bad problem if one of the best weapons for stealth ""The Judge Shotgun"" is locked behind the community item list. The ""fix"" to this is to leave and rejoin the steam group everytime this happens, but from my personal experience this happens everytime I log into the game, or even when I finish a heist it can sometimes happen. So if you're doing some stealth heists, be prepared to possibly go to the steam page to unfollow and refollow the group every single time you finish a heist, and let's say you have the game downloaded and you're without internet (e.g travelling and playing on a steam deck), you wouldn't be able to use the unfollow and refollow method and those items will remain locked for you.

Most payday 2 players probably aren't even bothered by this, not because it's not a big deal, they're just used to it, the community has found ways to mitigate it, both in-game and using third-party mods, but that's no excuse for the developers not fixing the game to be functional. It's just really frustrating to have starbreeze retroactively ruin their own game for seemingly no reason, and it looks like they're not gonna fix these bugs either as they continue working on the sinking ship that is PD3. Especially when they could seemingly just rollback the updates back when the game was in a functional state, which wouldn't remove any content. This review is more for the people who are thinking of getting into PD2 more than anything.

It's a great game, genuinely a lot of fun, both playing with friends and playing on my own, but in it's current state it is really poor, there are a lot more bugs I have not mentioned. On top of egregious amounts of DLC, Multiplayer being populated by cheaters (with no anti-cheat), the Epic games matchmaking integration fiasco, some people's save files (which they've spent hundreds of hours on) just getting erased, random crashes, bugged out physics. Don't give your money to these devs who are just gonna make the game worse and then not fix it, they're only focused on fixing up Payday 3 to the standard it should have been at on release, which, despite not being up to standards, they're already pumping out paid DLC for."
poisoned by Epic Games
blogis
worst fps
better than the sequel (finally got 1k hours yay) (also buff maniac and hitman pls i beg)
Remember when you could play online on Linux?
i love this game (release my family please)
sold out to epic and ruined the steam version get fucked dev's hope your greedy ass company fails
"After U237, this game has lost any and all interest in being a functional piece of software. I don't know what sort of drugs Starbreeze and OVERKILL were on thinking that breaking a game with a decade's worth of generally always working for a shitty storefront and player base that doesn't even buy their games through a service that never seems to work at all, let alone correctly. Due to this, I have zero plans of ever buying anything else from Starbreeze/OVERKILL, and I do wish them the best in their efforts to stay afloat.

However, 236 and earlier, great game. Good fun, even with power creep and weird janky heists that sometimes has some funny moments because of the Diesel engine. Gonna miss it."
"Ever since release the game has felt like an unfinished product. There is minimal polish, bugs and issues that have existed since launch that I can only assume are ""features"" now.

Out of nowhere they've now forced everyone onto Epic Game Servers as well, so enjoy the spyware that comes with that.

Barely functional. Will never be fixed. Not touching another product made by this company if this is the best they can do after years of development, and I've been here the entire time."
THIS IS SO FUCKING BROKEN SINCE IT GOT ADDED TO THE EPIC STORE. DONT BUY UNTILL IT GETS FIXED. When the game crashes it doesnt go back to your home screen it just stays fucking up until you turn of your computer
"This is a heist simulator 2013. 

It is not a game. It is not even a play.
And it doesn't increase real money. So there is no fun.

Do not buy it."
Bad game
no linux support
"I've played this game for quite a while, and have enjoyed my time with it.
Very recently though, some incompetent people at whichever side decided that implementing cross-play with Epic Games is important, which is good conceptually. More people get to play the game, and for free too.
It'd be all well and good if it weren't for how absurdly awful its implementation is though.
Constant crashing, people's save files corrupting, barely being able to join heists, Terribly done invite systems that worked fine before, and so on.
OVERKILL has come back from similar blunders, and I believe they're able to do it again,
but in its current broken state, I cannot at all recommend this game to newer players.
It'll definitely take some time to fix, especially with all the people who I assume were moved over to the PD3 team. It's really just the perfect storm of terrible things.

If it ever does get fixed, then it'll be worth playing again."

game does not launch even tho i have done everything to fix it but you can try and play it
Unplayable in multiplayer
Made the game harder to play on steam cause epic paid them big money to do it
Single highhandedly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ its content by making multiplayer epic games locked on steam. Dlc locked content is also a massive turn off 2/10 game
Single highhandedly fucked its content by making multiplayer epic games locked on steam. Dlc locked content is also a massive turn off 2/10 game
I didn't think it was possible to get a majority of the player base to stop playing in a single update but here we are.
"Was a really fun game to play with friends, that I have a lot of good memories of, but the online play with friends is incredibly tedious being disconnected 1-3 times per heist, and the online matchmaking being a joke, if this gets fixed I can say that it is a really good game, but untill it is, the game is not playable outside of a singleplayer campaign"
Buggy
240.3 broke the game again.
"While previously the game was a bit buggy, until the game is fixed following the epic games update its gonna be literally unplayable for some players, besides the bugs being a massive problem I otherwise recommend the game, because before the update, it was very fun and sometimes the bugs were even funny, but now it may not even boot at all due to bugs depending on the player's setup, so for that reason I can not currently recommend the game in this state"
I cant even start the game dont buy it
Amazing game when it first came out. Got flooded with bad DLCs as a money grab and is now unplayable. Payday 3 is 40€ preorder but you can also preorder for like 90€ the gold edition including a season pass with weapons and maps. In short if you buy the normal version you do not purchase the full game as you do not get access to content updates. you will have to pay twice the money for that. So payday 3 will start as bad as payday 2 ended. Realy sad.
"deadgame 2 and now their releasing deadgame 3 for 4x the price, if i see even 1 dlc for it its going to be a hard pass, which seeing how this game currently has 82 dlc's im not even going to add it to my wishlist"
I LIKE SERVERS
"The update is still there, waiting to be installed, and it's gonna stay there.

I don't want my antivirus berating me for downloading anything epic related, specially when it fucks shit up."
"Starbreeze and massive mismanagement.  It is just fitting like Sega and mismanagement, EA and anti-consumerism, and Randy Pitchford being a massive lying scumbag.

As many of you know, Update 237 broke the game completely.  No more mods (especially the useful quality of life UI ones), a lot more crashes and loading issues, weapons went missing, no side job rewards system, oh and the two most important issues:  No more Payday 2 for Linux users (abandoned Linux support), and matchmaking system is broken, so you can't play the game online it seems.  A co-op multiplayer shooter where you can't play the game online!

But the worst part?  We should have seen this coming, since Starbreeze has a history of mismanagement and bonehead decisions.

Here's a bit of a history lesson:

- Despite being rushed out in an incomplete state, Payday 2 is still one of the best selling games on Steam, somehow.

- Company makes a ton of money, value of your company rises in the eyes of investors.

- Best selling game = Bo Andersson's ego massively inflated!  AND HERE COMES THE BONEHEAD DECISIONS.

- PS3/XBOX 360 versions rarely gets updates, leaving the console gamers behind with an out of date game, and shows signs that the development team are having issues with updating the game for those consoles.

- Bo Andersson wants a new game engine.  Pays $8.6 million on the Valhalla Engine, despite the engine basically being nothing but scripts and no development tools, and shows no signs that this is an actual functional game engine!  https://www.gamedesigning.org/engines/valhalla/

- Announce a big title game using a huge IP: Overkill's The Walking Dead.  This uses Valhalla Engine.

- Overkill devs find out Valhalla is nothing but scripts and no development tools and to get Overkill's The Walking Dead in a functional state, Overkill switches to Unreal Engine 4....with around 6 months left until the release date.

- Overkill's The Walking Dead releases in an insanely broken and buggy state missing basic features like keybinding.

- The Walking Dead co-creator Robert Kirkman is (rightfully) FURIOUS.  Revokes Starbreeze's license to use The Walking Dead.  Game gets shut down and removed from Steam.  Console versions cancelled.

- MEANWHILE AT PAYDAY 2....

- Microtransactions!  Just ignore the fact that we said in the past that there will be no microtransactions!

- Despite what Reddit and other gaming media idiots say:  The microtransactions information gets leaked by not only one, but TWO Overkill/ex-Overkill devs on a Payday The Heist /vg/ thread on 4chan  (I was in the thread, so I know about this and remember this.)

- Fans boycotts.  Eventually microtransactions changed so you don't need a key (or drill in this case) to open skin cases.  Acceptable compromise.

- Console versions?  Those who bought the game for PS3 and XBOX 360 will now have to upgrade to the PS4 and XBox One versions to get all of the latest content....oh wait it's still out of date, you need to buy an update pack in the future to keep the game updated with all of the DLCs.  And the game on PS4 and XBox One seems to suffer from slow downs.

- Whoops, we can't support the console versions anymore.  Tough luck console players!

- End Payday 2 development in 2018.

- Company is broke, bring Payday 2 back into development and release more DLC!!

- MEANWHILE AT STARBREEZE...

- Bo's brother, Ulf (the face and voice of Wolf in Payday 1 and 2) has enough of the bullshit and leaves Overkill to start his own company.

- Bo continues to overspend Starbreeze's money.

- Spend money on a failed VR headset that was inferior to the other VR headsets out there.  This fails.

- Spend money on opening a VR theme park in Dubai.  This also fails.

- Spend money and fund ex-Overkill devs' game RAID: World War II.  It's Payday but in World War II, with John Cleese of Monty Python!  The game sucks.  Oh and that other game that was announced years ago called ""Storm""?  That's now dead too!

- Bo eventually blames The Walking Dead's fisaco on the devs for being lazy, even though the devs had to work with an impossible deadline, an engine switch, and other company mismanagement.

- Bo continues to blame everyone but himself and his own stupidity.

- Bo eventually gets charged and arrested for insider trading.  Starbreeze is in the hole.  Gets restructured.

And that pretty much covers it.  All of these bonehead decisions and company mismanagement shouldn't surprise anyone, including loyal Payday 2 players.

Update 237 is just another decision that ended up killing Payday 2 and quite possibly the Payday franchise along with it."
"1.bad connect i with my friend to play this game but cant connect,ovk use the epic server in steam
2.sometime maybe i cant play whit my friend he Next to me but he cant join game
3.EPIC FREE FOR OVK TO THEM PAYDAY3 FOR GET ANYONE MONEY AND USE HE BAD SERVER
4.i dont know in steam,epic but use epic server
傻逼游戏操你妈队友连半天都连不上那服务器和烂橘子一样的操你妈"
"Absolute trash game.
The servers suck ass.
I raged so badly I made a hole in my table.
I hate this game soo much.
I just to like this game and I was good at it and now after few years I came back to play it and its the worst game I have played.
I hope payday 3 is better."
"game straight up just doesnt launch,please revert the 237 update :("
"This is a live service game with a sequel on the horizon. By the end of 2023, it will be as dead as the dodo - and the single player experience is very weak.

If you're considering getting into this, wait for Payday 3."
bring back the musket
"Dogshit game, stinks"
"U237 f--ked everything up, from multiplayer mode to support for GNU/Linux. Can no longer play Multiplayer: joining lobbies always fails and hosted lobby won't get anyone joined. Playing on GNU/Linux is now severely impacted, no longer receive updates and only singleplayer mode, which is f--king ridiculous."
"when a random has a red laser, and i get downed, i can say there was a sniper behind me"
used to be one of my favourite games but the new update wiped my save file
"Came back after a couple of years after learning that the base game was free on Epic and hoped to play with some new people from other platforms: 
Much to my surprise I came to find an absolute clusterfuck update that slows down and clumsies the few aspects of playing online that it doesn't break.
Also, most EGS players oftenly turn out to be absolutely lost by the mechanics of even the menus. I expect a level 5 player to spent half an hour browsing through his inventory, skills and preplaning for a ""Four Stores"" Heist, not a level 50 like I've found. Hope this situation is reverted or at least we are given the chance to only get into Matchmaking with Steam players."
nie chce sie wlaczyc chujstwo
RIP Payday 2
Dont play this game from today on its just a scam for any new players they just sold theyr game out to epic games and called it a update237 if u think my review is overreacting i recommend you to see further reviews from wich ae posted after update 237
"dont buy it if u dont want to play it on vr. 
also on vr the graphics  are very low, but its still a bit fun.
wait for payday 3"
Added EOS.
Connection to the host has been lost.
"GET THE FXXKING RANGE FILTER BACK, WTF WAS WRONG WITH YOUR BRAIN TO COME UP WITH SUCK MISERABLE IDEA TO CUT IT OFF???"
"ITS BEEN 10 YEARS for this game to be good back then but right NOW THE DEVS F*K it up CAN'T play with Friends anymore
Great JOB Overkill by teaming with EPIC
Mods = Broken
Matchmaking/Playing with Friends = RUINED
Damn you EPIC GAMES.
I hope you don't Make PAYDAY 3 Garbage when released.
Edit: Theres a Fix for this but is kinda complicated. Just search in the Internet"
Fuck u epic
Update 237 killed this game. EOS is trash. (I will remove this review if/when the recent changes are fixed/reverted)
I can barely find lobbies after epic games update.
"I bought payday 2 on STEAM, I want my steam features, I don't care about more public players, I play with my stream friends and that functionality is now so broken its not even funny.

When I only care about playing with friends, breaking the friend system is a big deal. I wish I could refund this game, I would have never bought it in this state. its bullshit that they can ruin games with mandatory patches after I buy it."
"game is unplayable since last update with epic crossplay. Nothing works and when i say nothing, i really mean nothing being able to  start a game or join some lobby sounds like miracle.Not even talking about people's loosing their thousands+ hours accounts bcs of stupid save files corruptions, luckily i had backup of mine

game was really good back then tho, i mean there was lot of bugs and things like that, but all of us got used on it, it was not big deal. 

Hope devs will wake up soon and they'ill get rid of that stupid epic or atleast they will fix all these problems

FUCK EPIC"
"Literally can't play, it's too broken. Lobby frequently bugs out, someone has to rejoin to get it to work all the time. If host bugs then the entire lobby is screwed. Players get stuck loading in, Ready-up status doesn't sync properly half the time, using -steam and -steamMM causes steam invites and joining off steam to fail, so it's very difficult to play with friends without dealing with their failure of net code.

Edit: They fixed the lobby code burn-in at least :p"
Remove EOS
videogames suck
"I used to play this game a lot with friends; despite the jank and loading issues at times, I had a blast especially then, and I still liked returning to this game to play a round or two, and it's good enough fun. However, the last four or so times i've tried to play over the last several months, the game simply refuses to load; re-installing, clearing cache, removing all mods, running in different windows modes, there's no fixes I can find anywhere that've worked and honestly despite the time played, I'd rather just leave it uninstalled. Maybe payday 3 will fucking work properly lol, I have nostalgia towards it but if I can't play the game for this long, I just can't recommend it to anyone"
"This game has been a favorite of mine for a long time, sadly with the release of u237 i havent been able to open the game."
game sucks
"What a way to ruin a good game.

For anyone wanting to buy this game, just save yourself and your money. Don't give more to this greedy company"
"I do and I dont recommend the game. I do recommend the gameplay, story, and gunplay. It is a genuinely fun game. 

There is one bug that is making me not recommend the game. It can not, and will not capture my mouse. Ive tried FOR YEARS to fix it. Ive googled every variation of the issue i can think of. If you go google something to try to find a solution, I promise you, Ive already seen it. Ive reinstalled. Ive verified the files. Ive reinstalled my OS, Ive used intel processors, Ive used AMD processors. I have used the integrated GPU and Ive used dedicated GPUs. 

No change on my end makes the mouse capture in the window. Not the cursor, that captures just fine. The X and Y position of the mouse isnt captured. I have three monitors. With the game open, if I move the mouse to the right, the cursor remains within the bounds of the game window, but the OS still registers the mouse as over my discord window and lets me scroll through discord. This happens in game too! Ill be filling a bulldozer with lead, and then ill bump the scroll wheel and I see discord scrolling. 

Someone at starbreeze, please message me and let me help you fix this. This has been plaguing me for at least a few years now.

Again, Ive tried every remedy on google. I will buy someone Payday 3 if they have a fix that is permanent and not a kludgy temp fix. I want to be free of this curse."
"can't join sh*t, f*ck this update and f*ck cross play"
"wont even open anymore, thx for epic integration tho"
Game just doesn't even work anymore
countless DLC's and they still went for more money. greed killed this game
"Ruined the game functionality by suckling Epic Games. Epic is a cancer for games and fuck the devs for again, screwing the community."
"Weeks ago I d recommend. [b]Now I do not[/b] due to recent game breaking changes, desicion to infest this game with EOS spyware (which it is not even marked on Steam store page at the time of writing this review) and idiotic decision to merge Steam and Epic multiplayer. 👎👎👎"
"I really enjoyed this game, and while I can understand the reasoning for pulling native Linux support, I strongly believe that this was a bad move. Especially during the better era of gaming on Linux and how far the Steam Deck has come, even with tools like Proton that provide a compatibility layer for non-native games, the need for native ports is still here."
"The game was fun. Now it's a mess. I never played the multiplayer post 237, but I saw memes. What makes this worse is that the controller layouts for the Steam Deck no longer work. I really hope this gets fixed, since my PC can't run this."
"it's really fun for a few hours,  its just not my type. And with payday 3 on the horzion, i would look more in that direction than this one."
"Finding a loud DS lobby is next to impossible, good job with 237"
"get f**k as ps3/ps4 player with crimewave edition with lack of updates, then turn to PC version and just get f**k again with u237, thanks overkill...."
"The game now uses Epic Games Service's for matchmaking, making it unplayable in multiplayer."
"I Cannot recommend this game anymore  Game was fine as it was then they pulled the run out from under Linux players banned Russians from Buying Payday 3 cause suddenly the people of Russia are at fault,and then made this Rely on Epic Games store for their servers who are known to be shady bastards when it comes to Data. Since this latest update I've stopped playing Entirely Fuck Epic Games Viva La Steam"
"Good job, random and sudden reliance on Epic Online servers destroyed the game. Was selling out to the EGS for free release really worth trashing the ability to play on Steam?"
"did a fresh install of the game and it doesnt even launch on startup lol, thanks overkill"
Epic Online Services were added compromising experience of Steam userbase so that they get to give the game away for free on EGS.
"If they drop Linux support, I drop my support. I feel like it's an equal trade :)"
"While at it's core it was a fun game, and it had so much potential on release. It's been a good few years since that, nowadays the game is bloated and constantly mismanaged by incopetent devs. The lastets cross play update is a good example of, but not the only one. Knowing overkill they will never get the game into a good shape again, and they should be given no attention for payday 3, it's just going to go down the same route."
"Switched over to EOS (Epic Online Services), broke plenty parts/features of the game.
Noone asked for this, consumers are NOT benefiting from this. Opposite in fact, as some downgrades were introduced, making features worse.

Shameful and disgusting move by dev. Definitely not gonna redownload the game, since I don't want to install malicious spyware on my system that is proven to check files it has no right to touch.

For an in-depth look at the situation, I refer to this amazing review: https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaco909/recommended/218620/"
"Loved this game to bits, and still to at some points, but now it's just sad. A dev who cares jack-sh*** for its fans and gives the game to a scummy other dev to ruin it. If u guys are smart, you will stay away from the game and it's future releases until Overkill finds its common sense again and rollbacks the sh***show that is their latest update. 

Say no the Update 237 and say no to the scumlords that are EpicGames!"
must das sein
"goodbye payday. 
you had a good run.
screw u237 and eos.
somehow managed to destroy a 10 year old game in a single update."
Can no longer play this game due to latest update.
why do game devs think it's a good idea to add dumb stuff to a already good game and kill it. Like with EOS Epic Online Services which is messing up multiplayer
"Linux support has been spotty for a while now but not only have they completely dropped support but they broke the windows version too, a bunch of my progress got recent, and for what? Being put on epic? What a joke

Payday 3 is already showing a god awful microtransaction system too, don't give this company money"
"I love PD2 its the main reason  why I got a Gaming laptop but for some reason i can't start it and it wont open up wtf!    
how can you ruin something at was already perfect and *knock on wood* if payday 3 fails what then!! your money maker PD2 is broken on steam Its going to get review bomb to all hell. Its a sad day to a game you love die."
Not good game. Tried to play with friend who had this game on steam and i had it on epic. didn't work .kept crashing.
This game was fun at one point. It's sad to see the developers treat the player base so carelessly. If you have been playing this game on steam since launch and purchased the dlc along the way it can't feel good. I'll personally be passing on PayDay 3 due to how the developer is treating this game.
-removed linux support and made it platform exclusive (windows)
"I bought the game years ago, and now it doesn't show up in my library and I have to buy it again to play? lmao, okay."
"The new update 237 just destroyed the game. My payday 2 isn't even launching i thought it was a game with really big potential (it was) but i guess i was wrong :/ and for those who are wondering i did everything to get my payday 2 but it's not working so basically i bought a game which was cool until this update which introduce Epic Games Players. I do not think that this was a great idea, for what i'm seeing in youtube matchmaking in steam is completely dead, mods are dead too some people lost their rewards from the side jobs. For now i won't recommand this game and i'm starting to think Overkill is a money industry, so sad for a game with so much potential.... :/"
"Came expecting some sort of tactical, strategic, realistic shooter where I got to rob banks. 

Instead I got some arcadey, repetitive shooter where literally hundreds of identical enemies stream towards you from the same choke points in endless waves. 

And the DLC.....my god, the DLC. 80 pieces of DLC totalling $370 dollarydoos, seriously? Talk about flogging a dead horse."
You should've just made the game free discounted on Steam. That would've been much easier for everybody than trying to sell out to Epic.
"Requires downloading Epic Game's EOSDK to play online, forcing you to use Epic Games' servers instead of Steam's servers for matchmaking. EOS is notoriously unstable when it comes to performance and has major security risks being owned by Tencent. Overkill is on record flat out lying about this stating that we will not have to download the EOS or any 3rd party tools, but when the new update released EOS was secretly installed as part of the game now. 

EOS is NOT listed as being required in the EULA.
EOS is NOT listed on the Steam store page as being required.
EOS was NOT going to be installed according to Overkill, which we now know is a blatant lie.
EOS is NOT wanted. Remove it."
fix online service
not Team fortress 2 :(
Overkill broke their game by shilling out to EPIC games.
im joining the overkill hate train because they broke their game
"better matchmaking than pd3 ill give it that
and also better launch"
"Nope, needs remake/remaster desperately :/"
rip payday
"Game literally sold it's soul for free to a launcher that no one willingly uses because it is in every way worse than steam and the only reason anyone uses it at all is either for Fortnite or free games. Steam version literally does not launch at all, Linux has been cast into the fiery depths of hell with the console version and Overkill has show their incredible ability to completely fuck up such a sound and very well made game. If update 237 ever does somehow get fixed or just entirely revoked than i would recommend this game, but I'm sure they're probably stuck in a contract with the leech that is Epic Games so I wouldn't get my hopes up."
I cant even start the game up after the new update i looked up every tutorial and tried everything from reinstalling too moving files and the game just wont start up... i downloaded on epic games but all my progress and DLCs are gone so many hours and  just wasted. this was always one of my favorite games of all time and now i cant even play it anymore....
"I’m surprised that this game is so good, despite the stupid decisions of the Developers and Publishers. The direction and decisions of the company are a senseless mess, it almost seems like you want to sabotage your own damn game with every decision. Now not only do the mods not work, but you can’t even play it on Steam.

I’m afraid that PayDay 3 is going to end up being a failure, because as usual, y'all will be working hard to make it so. I love this game, but it seems that all we have left is to imagine what it would have been with a competent direction."
sex
"Ever since U237, I can't join any lobbies, everything is ruined, lost all my side jobs, everything, I may as well had to have restarted entirely. Even if I do get into a lobby and play it somewhat, I always disconnect, then when I try to rejoin, I can't rejoin, then I have to reboot PAYDAY AND STEAM to wait 5 minutes for it to load again to get back in. Absolutely terrible. Horrific game now. I hope PD3 IS NOT LIKE THIS."
"u237's implementation of EOS just saved me $60AUD because I will not be buying Payday 3. If Starbreeze are this incompetent at implementing crossplay with EGS, it'll be completely fucked in PD3 as well, and I'm not dumb enough to support that."
Update 237 ruined it all :(
"Played this game for years, both on console and PC. Ended up buying every DLC because the game was fun, there's very few games that manage to include heists and have them be decent. 

But after using Steam matchmaking for 10 years with no issues, then they sell out to Epic, force everyone to download Epic's spyware, and what's worse is it doesn't even work properly, matches are laggy, if you can even get in one, essential features like being able to invite friends have been removed, if you try to use mods it blocks you from being able to play with others unless they have all the same mods when that was never an issue before..

Already removed your dodgy spyware from my PC as well as Payday 3 from my wishlist as I have no interest in it anymore. You sell out to shady companies, you get what you deserve."
"I played Payday the heist with all their reasonable DLC. I got hyped for Payday 2 and preordered it.

Boy, not many saw coming what they were about to do to PD2. Overpriced DLCs back in the day, DLC galore for EVERYTHING(Clothing, gun sights, muzzles, for every gun modification, guns, dlcs for masks, maps, skills and so on), broken promise and misusage of the Hypetrain event, Lootboxes for Weaponskins, later Weaponskins with bonus stats in the lootboxes.

Starbreeze monetized the shit out of this game and showed more and more, how less they truly care about the fanbase and just want the money.

Now, they reached the end of the road with PD2 and are already monetizing PD3 with Preorder bullshit.

Don't worry, just a burned fan, who regrets to have supported this."
don't work no more
"I have hundreds of hours clocked into this game, i genuinely love it and played it for a few years before taking a break due to life stuff and other games coming out. Payday 2 is a great game, a genuinely fun time with friends and the constant updates helps keep things fresh even if the new additions are small and the paid dlc quite rampant, though they're reasonably priced enough that they're generally worth it.

I'm not recommending this game now, because as of the time of this being put out Payday 2 has just been moved to the epic games store and it has completely broken the game.

There are loads of reviews already pointing out the flaws, matchmaking being broken, the game's modding tools being broken, some not being able to launch the game all because the game had to be updated and implemented into epic and its online service/

I am unsure of how the epic version runs, and i am not going bother getting that just to test it especially since all my dlc and progress has been on steam, so until these issues are fixed i cannot and will not recommend the steam version to anyone."
Monotonous
this game is dead now
they broke the game
Epic Gayms
DROPPED Linux support. People who bought this game cannot play anymore. I wouldn't buy anything from this publisher when they will just remove your ability to play the game.
"I loved this game. I loved playing this game with friends. After the server update my best bet is playing solo, which I don't like to do. The servers need to be reverted to steam ones instead of Epic's so its playable again, and then my review may change. Until then I'm just disappointed."
fuck update 237
bad game no rapp battles in there
Why is my left ball bigger than the right?
"UPDATE 237 

FUCKED ME IN THE ASS

THE GAME DOES NOT EVEN OPEN

AHHHHHHH"
"The recent Epic Online Services update added crossplay for Epic players at the expense of Steam players. The game won't even function without being connected to Epic. So if they're having server issues from some big Fortnite update, it's going to affect this game too. Where previously it didn't.

The devs have stayed silent regarding the PD2 community's discontentment regarding this recent change, so I'll be happy to give them this review. Don't buy any further Payday games/DLC, remove them from your wishlist and following list, and tell your friends to do the same. It's the only way they'll learn.

Edit: They recently posted a community announcement update with no mention of removing EOS in the game, so my review stands."
Murdered Linux support
Surprised it took them this long to break the game.
update 237 is definitely one of the updates of all time...
This was truly an EPIC update
"OVK/Starbreeze took the vbuck bribe and now we have to go through command line shenanigans just to play the mf game, 10/10 would acquire instantaneous buyer's remorse again"
U237 removed all interest for me to play the game. Way to go guys. You fucked it up. You fucked it up so badly just to make us buy a crappier sequel that's not even out yet.
Epic games turns everything it touches to ash
"Back in 2017 when i was still playing this game, OVERKILL said they were going to start working on PAYDAY3 and that there was not going to be anymore DLC for this game.

6 years and 42 DLCs later PAYDAY3 got its steam page up.

I would like to post a negative review on PAYDAY3 just for this, but I also don't want to spend the money on liars."
trollshrugged themselves
After the most recent update adding in Epic Games support i tried to play with a friend who was using the -steamMM launch command to get the game working since i was not having the issue but when suggesting for me to use the command so we could use steam invites to play together i launched the game using the command and the game promptly erased all my save data and progress. A useless update that has ruined a game i have supported for nearly a decade. Very upset 0/10.
You can stick your Epic Store bullshit where the sun dont shine.
fix the epic grimes and steam crossplay
they fucked the entire game with the newest update
"With EGS addition and update 237, matchmaking is ridiculously bugged still even with the hot fix they did. Game was working perfectly with seamless matchmaking and now its just broken, cant recommend at its current state."
"They were doing great,than killed it all for money"
Game no work me angry >:(
"Its like a second The Sims game. But just because of the amount of DLCs you can purchase. You'll pay more than 250€ to own JUST all DLCs.
I would get a refund if i payed for the game"
I'm glad that they killed payday 2 just in time to reveal that you can now buy payday 3. I guess it's not enough that you have a new game to sell but you also need to break the old one so that nobody wants to play it anymore.
"With the acclaim that it had received, I was expecting more from this game. Neat, probably WAY better with friends and not as relevant as Payday 3 is coming out soon."
How much did Epic pay you?
"> Went to re-install the game.
> Epic online services not connecting.
> Uninstalled."
Was a good game. Now its just a burning mess
"I heard Zoomerday 3 is coming out there, it's a pity there is no page in steam
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"A fantastic game that i enjoyed for quite a while, but the update where they linked epic store they ruined it. forced multiplayer sessions to host on epic games store and now you literally cannot do multiplayer anymore."
"Came back after a year away and  you guys somehow screwed the game up so hard, me and a few others can't even launch the game after verifying anymore, and have to downgrade to a legacy version, thank you people for selling out.

New info
Alright, The not being able to launch the game was on me, but still, apparently you lot didn't do this game any good over the last couple weeks."
"This used to be one of my favourite games with a surprising amount of community driven events a couple ARG's and decent teamwork based gameplay. Key phrase ""used to be"". My opinion has soured, mostly the behind the scenes and monetary practices but recently they made multiplayer and modding more difficult with a massive oversight of a partnership with Epic Online Store.

The numerous DLC alone is enough to turn players away, even if you buy the complete edition bundle you are still missing several power creep DLC's they added after declaring no more paid DLC's. Even amongst those within the bundle there is a paid advertisement and tie-ins with other media not even related to any element of Payday. 

They added microtransaction weapon skin loot boxes akin to CS:GO a slight difference being that some weapon skins added stat boosts. This was one of the first major exodus's of the player base. Later during update 100 they removed the paying aspect and made them free to open from that point on, later still they removed the entire loot box system and replaced it with daily reward weapon skins. 

Recently they added the update 237 which is when they switched the Steam Matchmaking with Epic Online Store's, using the Epic servers for multiplayer and match making. This has lead to being unable to connect to multiplayer lobbies and removed being able to join lobbies via Steam. Due to this, they have shot multiplayer outside of Epic Online Store in the foot.

There is still a good game in there, it's just buried under mismanagement, greedy developers and power creep. I'd say get the game if you can play with friends but as previously mentioned, you can't do that any more. I hope Payday 3 will have sorted their Matchmaking, have sensible DLC that isn't driven by power creep and that the microtransactions within stay purely cosmetic. But as it stands now, Payday 2 is a beaten and broken beta that is not worth the money nor the disk space it rides on."
update 237 = bad
"В жизни не покупайте этот кусок кала.
Хотя можете купить саму игру за 19 рублей по скидке и скачать DLS Unlocker, чтобы не тр A хать себе мозг"
"Always enjoyed this game mostly for the content people created.

you killed them Starbrereze, even carrot."
EPIC SHIT STORE  FUCKING SOLD TO EPIG SHIT STUPID
I will pirate payday 3
Im a linux user and 237 broke everything for me. Basically an exit scam after all the money i spent on the dlc
Thumbs down just because they sold their souls to Epic. Dead game.
"game itself is good but no tutorials makes it hard for beginners to learn. also, game crashes on startup / when joining lobbies."
"I love the moment Overkill said ""It's payday!"" and sold themselves out to Epic Shit Games"
"Ive loved this game for a long while but, now that they have sold out to epic games, and changed the matchmaking, the game just completely does not work for me anymore. I have verified files and reinstalled but I cant even get to the start up cutscene without the game hard crashing"
Insulting amount of DLCs
EPIC
"Good game but always have connection problem, there are too much item that need DLC to unlock"
"meh, just really another shooter with ""interact here"" stuff scattered around. Friends wanted to play it with me, but the games age really shows, nothing really seems engaging with the exception of the stealth missions.

TLDR; generic at its worst, an actual heist game at its best"
(Update 237) Look how they massacred my boy
"i still can't believe that you made so many mistakes so fast, probably a new world record...also i stil don't have my haunted outfit, i waited already a year, please, at least give me that"
"This game is so much fun with other people, it's a nice game to turn your brain off on the lower difficulties and sweat extra hard on the higher ones. There's super fun hidden lore and a really complex secret endgame.

Shame the latest update sided with the one gaming store known for actively installing spyware and stealing games from other markets with a definitely not at all suspicious endless supply of cash.
RIP Payday 3, excited to see how long it takes before the Steam page magically disappears and it becomes an Epic exclusive.

Real shame."
"thanks for not being able to buy your game for the third time
---------------------------
спасибо за невозможность купить вашу игру в третий раз"
"I guess the game just isn't for me.  It was highly recommended by several friends, but I just find the gameplay boring and repetitive."

they removed Linux support for literally no reason
"I'm Leaving it. 

 You killed it."
UPDATE 237 killed the game
"haven't played in months came back due to the PD3 trailer and things are just broken. DSOD lobbies don't exist lobbies in general are way down and the majority i've seen either crash or just cant be connected to properly. 

second if i wanted to be apart of the EG ecosystem i would be i don't fully understand the reasoning behind forcing it on people now when the presumed final update is less then a month away. aswell as dropping support for linux when they've been brought along for so many years just to be denied the end for assumably a hefty payout of yuan. i'm unsure of whether you can even play it on the steam deck as i haven't tried nor will.

I feel as though breaking the game and goodwill of the Community has payed off in the short term i do not believe the new EG players will stick around. so come September the game may very well not have the players to play online"
poo poo
I can't recommend a game that forces you to use EOS
"only praised because it has no competition
bad game
live service would a compliment, looking forward to how the next cash grab will be"
Update 237 is not very EPIC if you ask me
update 237.
"1,467 hours spent on this game, with good memories. wasted on one EFFING update. thanks, starbreeze. for screwing it up, what a way to destroy your fanbase. screw your epic games server shiz, who uses epic games anyway other than just for free games. they're desperate."
"Thanks for crippling the game on Steam, guys. Very cool."
Can't believe they killed the game before Payday 3 came out.
Crazy how you can destroy an entire game in just one update
"starbreeze, blinded by greed lol"
"You already know why. This game has been on a steady power-crept decline for years now, and U237 has put the final nail in the coffin."
"they made the game literally unplayable in the last couple months before the new one came out

lol"
"good concept, poor execution"
"Can no longer play because dont accept the privacy policy.

If you want to have my data to sell it on, you gotta give me more than access to the game i already paid for.

Scumbags."
"Ever since the recent update to EGS cross-play, this game has truly become a dead game. Hosting or joining lobbies are glitched out to the max where it becomes completely unplayable. I recommend halting purchases on any dlc or even Payday 3 until the developers get their shit together!"
"Imagine getting this game for free, only to spend a ton of money on DLC. This game is only alive thanks to it's modding community. Rest in Piss Payday 2."
"TL;DR - The golden era is gone.

Very displeased with the whole "" We will never have microtransactions "" to having more in total when what the base game is worth. Poor support as well, considering they bricked the game in an effort to get more players from another platform. All of this while developing a third entry."
they heisted my real life money
"Cant play, goes to black screen after startup :("
Yeah they REALLY fucked the game
"Still a fun game, but they killed a lot of community with this sellout to Epic, but mostly how it was implemented. You used to be able to see 30 or 40k players, and have tons of people going around in matches, now if I go to search games, I barely see any, and many people are seeing tons of issues with joining and just overall playing the game. At this point it's not a recommend from me, fun, but not really worth it atm."
"[quote]
After more than 10 years, PAYDAY 2 will finally spread its wings and soar to a new PC platform. Starting today, you can now perform the unique heisting experience found only in PAYDAY via Epic Games Store. To celebrate this PAYDAY 2 will be free to claim on Epic Games Store from June 8th running until June 15th. Alongside the free period, the majority of DLCs will be for sale via the Epic Games Store.

We’ve worked hard to make the finest heisting experience on the market available on a new platform without any fuss. For existing players, there won’t be any third party software or functionality downloaded. So if you play on Steam, you’ll be able to keep playing as if nothing happened, though you might notice an influx of new players.[/quote]

They must have used weird auto-correct because Steam version is buggy as hell and also dropped Linux support."

update 237
this game is 83 gigabytes but it relies on dlc. i got this one sale for like 90 cents and that's absolutely what the base game is worth
Update 237
Dead Game speedrun any%
"All you had to do was: NOTHING, just let the game be as the game stops receiving updates BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOO, you had to go and ruin the game in a single update, because Crimefest 2015 wasn't enough.

It was fun while it lasted. GGs."
"U237 made the game even ""more dead"" than it was before. 
May you rest in peace good old payday 2, like my memories for you will. </3"
"- Finally got into the game after downloading sus 3rd party mods
- Walked and shot a bit
- Got kicked for ""beaing AFK"""
honestly this game just doesnt hold up in 2025. basically what i'd expect out of something that started as a kickstarter crowdfund for people who played a battlefield 2 mod.
"Very bad game, so high lagging that it is unplayable. People write about that on lot of forums, I didnt now that until I started to play this crap. Comuniti is vey bad, it is not good as you can find on some forums. The game is 5/100 for real!!!"
This game has a lot of negative features and consumer practices. Imagine selling emotes in a milsim lmao. The only reason I play and enjoy it is for the star wars mod. Go play Project Reality for free and more content than squad.
"Honestly upon first impression the game is fucking terrible, I've tried 3 different seemingly normal servers and all i got was disappointment. the game is truly not fun for people who aren't fat no lifers who couldn't get into the real armed services."
"Very Bad Optimization, great game but when scoped in the FPS drops very badly, shame on the devs"
"I could see this game being really fun, but only if you have a group of friends who you play it with and are willing to put up with the learning curve. It is a milsim so not sure what I really expected. If you like milsims that are pretty hardcore this is your game."
"Shit game kept running for hours to go to instantly die, no communication, it's too complex not for someone who has a job and wants to play for few hours"
this game is shit arma knock off
"Bad game, bad community. Game modes have 0 explanation. All the nations armor are 90% the same. Don't buy it"
"A boring game, and its community is extremely toxic!"
"this game has a poor optimization, no matter how much u set the lowest u can in this game, is barely playable"
walking simulator with guns
"nothing works like its meant to work, and there are no players in the servers. and also no way to host one with my friends. very sad ＞﹏＜

4.5/10"
Can't skip the 10 minute intro.
"ts is so ahh, ppl kick you for being new. the sweaty greasy discord mods scream at you when you do so much as misclick fire during a so called ""pep talk"""
A couple of updates back i started having stutters that haven't dissaperead even thought i just upgraded from a 1080ti to a 4090 and still the stutters are still there more fps but stutters now and then
"what the fuck did i just play ?!! terrible x3 optimization, it made my machine shut down 4 times during this little time of gameplay, which was absolutely fucking garbage,also the devs seem not to have touched nor seen a gun in their entire life the recoil is insane. And one thing for those nerdy admins or whoeever runs those servers, i don't need to be erwin rommel to play in your mighty server you dum fucks it's obvious that i'm new to this game, and some servers marked as NEW PLAYER FRIENDLY and yet the second you join i hear GTFO and get kicked out of the match ( happened 3 times in a row ). don't bother buy this shit even if you got for free it's a waste of bandwidth to download, seems already too late for new players to try this fucking garbage."
"TLDR: The gameplay and tactical aspects are great, but, overall, this game leaves an impression like it's still in very early access.

(Most of the time) feels (almost) incredible once you play it for a few dozen hours and get used to some of its quirks. However, in the beginning, this game felt really off-putting because of the lack of polish. Infantry combat is pretty solid, but vehicles and helicopters work like garbage. This is especially noticeable after playing games like War Thunder. Light tracked vehicles feel really jerky while turning. Large trucks will straight up fly like they are made out of carboard if you crash into something. Piloting a heli feels like piloting an alien spaceship. Its pitch/roll speed depends only on your mouse sensitivity and nothing else, or at least it seems so.

Some areas of the game are polished, but most aren't. Firearms have incredible textures, models and animations. And it feels nice to shoot them. But helicopters look like shit once you get closer and see the details or, god forbid, their interiors. UI looks and feels really outdated. Maps don't have any fine details or destructible objects, so a f.....ing wooden fence is enough to stop a tank.

Right, this game also has really poor optimization, at least as of now. Devs are currently switching to UE5, though, which can do wonders when it's in the right hands.

Some aspects of the game which absolutely should be improved, IMO:
- Add some actually good vehicle physics, models, textures, sounds and interiors.
- Improve map detalisation, make some objects (Like wooden fences) destructible.
- When you are incapacitated, your camera just shakes like crazy. It could definitely use some stabilization. Or, maybe, add some actually decent ragdoll physics so that bodies don't jump around and clip through objects all the time.
- Make it so that you can actually do something useful while sitting inside a vehicle, like reloading your weapons, healing your teammates or applying bandages. Just sitting on your ass is, at least, kinda boring.
- Make it so that casualties stay inside the vehicle instead of instantly falling out. Not sure how good of an idea this is, though.
- Using F1-F10 keys for switching the spot where you sit on a vehicle is.... Well, pretty strange.... Would be nice to have some sort of window open up instead. You could display all available and taken spots on it and just click on one of them with your mouse to change.
- Maybe it's time to stop adding more factions/maps, this game already has enough of both. Plus, everyone's picking the same few ones anyway. Simply adding more doesn't make the game better if some of its base mechanics are still very raw.

Overall, this game can bring a lot of fun, especially if you play with your friends in one squad or as different squad leaders in a single match. However, the quality of the game is really uneven. To a person like me, who doesn't know much about gamedev, it seems like Squad doesn't have a reason to cost so much or to take up so much space on my computer. At least in its current state."
"i dont like to be kicked from squad from squal lead with no explanation ,also you make the game very dificult to aim  becouse the low stamina"
Lots of crashes and bugs lately
"Incredibly wooden game! 
Runs ok. 
Still haven't discovered the technology of giving the player an option to just removing awful scopes from your gun so I can see while aiming. 
Semi-realistic.
Not my thing!"
not open play
wasted 20 minutes of my damn life having to sit through an unskippable cutscene. this is horse shit.
game with shitty servers problems
completed the tutorial went to find a game searched for a server for around 2 hours got instantly kicked once i got in so in conclusion great game
"99% of the time your running and getting killed, other 1% of the time your shooting at people and maybe getting 1-5 kills. better off buying hell let loose if u want better firefights and overall gameplay."
"people on the game are assholes and when you finally see an enemy and steady your gun witch takes like 30 seconds your dead, uniforms all look the same, and its complicated to be ""realistic"" then why tf don't they add a realistic sniper section so i don't get kicked every time i choose marksman, spotter and fucking shooter"
Company shot this game into the ground.
the comunity is a bunch of try hard cry babies
"just go into downtown bronx with a sandwich sign that reads ""i hate n_____s"" , like in Die Hard
and you'll know what it feels like to play this game."
"В этой игре ты не солдат, а маленькая палестинская девочка. полный бред. чуть чуть пробежал - прицел дрожит, будто ты пил водку целую неделю."
not worth 50 fucking dollars
"servers have been overrun by a bunch of new age faggots. Been banned from about every server now for the stupidest shit, things like ""offensive language"" or God forbid you tell a squad leader to actually do their job and organize/lead the fucking squad. Like isn't this a mature rated war simulator game??? Where did all these jrotc kids come from? This was not a problem when the game first came out"
"FPS drops all the time.

The aiming-in feature they added is not realistic. You don't take 3 weeks to adjust to the scope. They're making the game so realistic that it isn't even realistic anymore. Not to mention the fact you get out of breath in 5 steps. Is this a military person or a McDonald's employee handed a gun?"
"why are you forcing me to watch into movie every time, without ability to skip it. FFS"
"russians/ukrainians/slavic ""people"" ruin the game"
absolute dog water
Don't waste your money on this crap
this game is so hard your eyes will bleed
used to love this game but  latley server admins been on a power trip
"Super buggy can't know if graphic glitch or been shoot at, if you like playing buggy games with a lot of bot and almost no player this game is for you. you better put your cash in the hawk tua coin. 3 HOURS OF MY LIFE LOST. The person who recommend me this shit hate me for sure"
massive fps drops
My friend got this game for me and I just can not seem to find joy in it. There are so many toxic players that flame you and then go straight to admins of servers to complain. I am just trying to learn the game bro.
the game that could have been good that simply just isnt clunky as fk movement dog shit sighting for scopes and horrid controls
Infantry Combat Overhaul (ICO) ruined this game it was so fun RIP I played from 2017 till 2023 6.0 update
buggiest milsim
"Yeah its probably the most gate keeping community out of all the mil-sim games out there. It can be fun, but play it with friends. Alone its a toxic hell hole. I'd also recommend playing the Galactic Contention and Global Escalation mods. Global Escalation is squad, but you have to fight your own body less. And also i dont know how the devs messed up magnified sights so much but its solved on there. Moderation is a mess, nobody adheres to the rules and if you wanna get into flying, be ready to be fighting over helicopters every round. I wouldn't recommend for new-comers to the genre of mil-sim, dont play vanilla its ass and if you wanna have some form of fun play with buddies. Thats all i have to say."
running simulator
"I started playing this game years ago !! Loved every second of it, early access and long after it was exciting, the nuance of the project reality days. mad a few friends and had a few laughs and some intense moments for sure. Stopped playing about 3 years ago and decided to come back and give it another try.

OMG what a mistake!! Should of stayed away with those happy memories and sense of nostalgia. However my dumb self had to give it a shot again.

Explain to me how in so many years with so many updates this game is still optimized like a potato (Forgive me Potatoes) the game play feels (Yes its my opinion don't like it boo hoo) feels like its become more arcade instead of Mil Sim. 

Balancing !!!! what is that? Can I eat it?

DOnt let the screenshots and videos fool you!! You might . . . Might once in a blue moon see that much action. Most of the time you are walking, in a logi truck, in the re spawn menu or digging sandbags . . then 5 min of getting shot at by Casper the F#@K you ghost, cause you got no idea where that shot came from and oh. . . your team will be helpful 40 to 60% of the time. Oh there is a medic near by to help you and revive you HAHA Nope that man took that class because of the extra bandages and self heal !!

This is one of those games where you hate it, but you hate it so much you love it . . then lose your S#@T with a team member after he shot you for the 9th time because he cant tell a USMC Helmet from a freaking Scarf. So you rage quit go for a walk touch grass and come straight back saying . . this time. . this time will be different. . . Yeah its not. It never will be."
shit ahh game
they went over board with every think on this game. aiming reload times. recoil is so bad that it feels like you not even playing a actual shooting game . its slow. sometimes people even wont move the whole game as there to afriad to try and handle the recoil of there gun. in my eyes the worst hardcore FPS made to date !
Negative until getting stuck on everything with a vehicle is not a thing anymore.
Ebanoe optimization!
garbage
semi auto simulator you will never use automatic ever on any gun cause you will miss everything
"very insecure and homosexual player base, game would be fun if man children weren't larping instead of having fun and going outside to talk to women"
"Gunplay seems to have gone downhill in recent years, the audio and explosions ect are so immersive, but christ is the low stamina and crap gunplay a put off, feels so slow and awkward it really holds the game back."
"squad... pfft, should call it Wad because the game runs like a piece of shit"
"RTX 3070 R5800, this game is unplayable... lag and getting 30-45 fps only  devs are piece of sht i wish i can refund it.. stupid don't buy please"
bad game
"""please equip squad leader kit"""
unreal engine 4 on this game is the biggest pile of dogshit ever!
game runs like crap
I aint buying any more online games. Paying through my fking nose
Decent game but community ban list is beyond stupid a lot of admins for servers will just ban over a power trip perm bans suddenly bans you from multiple servers game is decent if you have patience to deal with speds role playing or just people running and dying instantly  almost 1000 hours its just a waste of time overall no progression or level or weapons modifications
"DO NOT PLAY 1STRB SERVERS!  I WAS KICKED FROM THEIR SERVERS FOR ONE-MANNING A VIC AFTER MY SQUADMATE LEFT AND SOMEONE COMPLAINED AND NOW I AM PERMANENTLY BANNED.  I ARGUED WITH THE 1STRB ADMING ""col"" giggidy"" AND HE PERMA BANNED ME AND KICKED ME FROM THE 1STRB DISCORD SERVER.  THE GAME IS GREAT, BUT OVER -ZEALOUS LOCALIZED SERVER ""admins"" WILL RUIN IT.  HE PUT ME ON SOME ""COMMUNITY BAN"" LIST SO THAT WILL LIKELY AFFECT MY ABILITY TO PLAY THIS GAME.  AGAIN.  I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TOXIC, THAT I AM AWARE OF AND THAT 1STRB, ""col giggidy"" COULD SHOW????  PLEASE HELP."
"Has a worse logistics and infantry system than competitors such as Arma Reforger. If you play dedicated logistics, you deprive the team of one of very few vehicles necessary to play logistics. If you play infantry, the gameplay feels unintuitive and more difficult in comparison to other milsim titles. If you play helicopters, you will actively fight to get the helicopter to do what you want it to do and god forbid you touch the ground a teensy bit too hard, you will combust into flames and kill everyone onboard.

No vehicle respawning, fixed loadouts, and gameplay difficulty through unintuitive design makes a game that is not worth the play."
Server list not showing up. For weeks my end. what the FUCK are the devs doing to this game.
"I loved this game until they did the rework of the shooting. Before if I got into a good position I had the opportunity to get multiple kills. I could shoot and scoot and outplay enemies or set up at a good vantage point and do work. After the update its so hard to even get one kill. The recoil and shaking in the scope make it impossible to have a decent fire rate on target. When an enemy shoots at you now it makes it impossible for you to see anything. I get that they were going for realism but come on man. Its not even fun anymore. Its a shooter that you can barely even shoot anyone in. 

The shooting rework in this game is the reason why ARMA Reforger is getting so popular. Id much rather play Squad than ARMA but Squad is no fun anymore."
Terrible performance for a 2015 game. Do not buy until the issue is fixed.
trash
moving to mid engine 5
the admins and server rules are getting worse every day that passes
Love the game but it needs achievements! Ill give a thumbs up if you give me a reason to grind the achievements!
Unoptimized b*lshit. Don't buy until >dec.2025
"High end pc gettin 50 - 45 FPS. Forums says, that its poorly optimised. Can't really play.."
regarded crap game got banned for cheating when I never cheated
No armor specific squad unlike squad 44 which is a terrible idea.
"I really, REALLY, like this game, but I have never had so many technical issues just trying to launch a game like I have had with this. It feels like if you put it down for 3-4 months, there is a new technical issue you have to overcome."
"Runs like utter crap, clunky and sluggish controls and animations, looks bad. 3/10"
гімно
Хуйня ебаная
"the mechanics are aweful, graphics are mediocre at best. Servers are usually ran my neck bearded redditors, all around 2/10 game. i would NOT recommend."
Game is built for something the playerbase is not capable of doing matches are unorganized half the time its a running simulator think of it as dayz but war and more polished nothing more If i could refund it i would
lol
e0g 0e
Could be great but the devs seem to want you an inch from your monitor looking through iron sights while scopes feel extremely clunky. solo play doesnt exist anymore
Honestly some of the most fun you'll ever have in a milsim but oh my god the random network issues are an absolute nightmare. As much time as you spend playing you'll spend trying to get the damn thing to run.
Long time to find a match.
I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD THIS PIECE OF SHIT GAME DOESNT WANT TO DETECT MY AUDIO DEVICE FOR SOME REASON IVE DONE EVERYTHING I KNOW THAT WOULD FIX IT AND IT JUST DOESNT WORK. i havent been able to play this game in months. im getting to the point where i want my fuckin money back

Might just buy arma reforger"
Doesnt let me play because I have a ban on call of duty. Thanks ricochet for the false positive that ruined my steam account.
"There's a good game in this somewhere, but it isn't here right now. That's for sure."
Keeps crashing...
"The game suffers from a segment of the playerbase that is irritatingly vulgar and childish, which hurts the gameplay experience.

Some of the community is patient and respectful, but there lies an issue of encountering disrespectful and offensive players which reduces my will to work together and play the objective.

The game mechanically is good in terms of the controls and combat, but it takes too long imo to get back into the action. A large portion of the match time is spent walking or driving to a point. The game could improve if there was stronger moderation and if there was a gamemode that replicated the faster pace of games like RS2 while still maintaining a realistic  experience"
you sit in queue for 30 minutes just to get disconnected from it
"No servers hosted by the game itself, relies too much on the community, and the vehicle handling is absolutely horrendous."
dumbass intro cutscene not skipable dumbass company
this game used to be really fun in 2016. now it just sucks unbelievably bad in every way imaginable.
"Great game, unfortunately if you're an Aussie gamer there is a lack of servers.

BIGD CAN SUCK A BIGD, MOST PANSY ADMINS I'VE EVER COME COME ACROSS. BANNED BY ASSOCIATION NO WARNING.

ADMINS WONT EVEN LOOK AT THE TICKET. WHAT A JOKE.

F**K U BIGD. BIGD ADMINS DONT EVEN KNOW HOW TO ADMIN. BUNCH OF CHILD FIDDLERS."
Spent 87.9% of the time walking.
"most servers are always either full or empty :( i wanna rate it good, but ive had this game for a year and still havent been able to find a server"
I do not recommend the game because of the verbal aggressiveness of the players which is permeated by nationalistic bellyaching and threats in real life.
10 YEARS AND YOU STILL CAN'T JOIN THE SAME FACTION WITH YOUR GROUP - that's not even the worst part but this game doesn't deserve more time or words.
Say anything an admin doesnt like they will kick you for whatever reason dont listen to some retard you also got a kick or temp ban
just all around not great. Large learning curve. Spend most of the time spawning in at the main base to have to spend the next 15 minutes running across the map. its really not great.
"The best way I can describe this game is that it feels like it was made in 2010. The core of the game has potential but the UI, gunplay, movement, visuals, and style in general feel outdated. This game has a core following, but to get a good experience, you have to download server specific mods which barely change gameplay aside from uniforms for the most part in my experience. I get what this game is going for, but I cannot recommend it."
"I don't understand how such an old game is so poorly optimized - I reinstalled Squad after not playing for years, and all I've been met with are crashes. I can't load into a server and play the game without it crashing. On my last attempt, the game crashed my PC. So I'm uninstalling."
"You are a sniper, 300m behind enemy lines. The team leader leaves the squad, and you are now the new team leader with a brand-new rifle setup and only one magazine. You have 5 minutes to configure your team leader setup before being kicked from the server, but you are 1.5km away from your nearest point.

Edit: Downloaded the game again after a long time, logged in, got hit, couldn't run because I was crouched, uninstalled again. Worst game-simulator ever. If you’re thinking about buying this, consider Arma Reforger instead."
"You buy squad because you think it'll be fun, you think it'll be bada*s, and all of these things are true. Right up until you interact with the player base, my god some of yall suck so much. No developer servers so it's all ran my the equivalent of the video game worlds discord mod blight and cancer. If you want to get team killed and kicked from servers after waiting for 10 minutes just to join, then drive your squad 10 more minutes just to get kicked once the action starts?? Nah bro f*ck this game."
im not racist
"its a really fun game but the gun play is terrible, its hard to get the muzzle near someone thats just 10 feet away because of the gun swaying where you look"
Predatory ban system made by people who treat this like a congressional meeting. No public REAL casual servers
makes me sad :(
"The players in this game squadbaiting and kicking from squads because they want to play with their shitty 2 man teams ruin the entire experience. Creates a walking simulator that ends up resetting you every 15 minutes because the squad leads either dont FUCKING SPEAK ENGLISH ON AN ENGLISH SERVER, or just outright dont understand the principal of having a squad. 4/10. community ruins the experience. waste of my time."
"Dogshit ass game. Walked 1.5km to setup my 240 on flank hill, out of the sudden got my entire kit snatched out of my hands by noone out of nowhere and replaced with m4 with a single 30rd mag, all bc idiot SL kicked me out bc his buddy wanted to play MG gunner. Listen up, Offworld. How about you make our fucking game NOT DOGSHIT????? WHEN IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN, ANOTHER 5 YEARS, 10 YEARS, WHEN?????"
The community is the single worst i have EVER met in my entire 36 year history of gaming. The absolute bottom of the barrel when it comes to just about every aspect of humanity. Want to learn Squad leading? You'll get yelled at for not Magically knowing how. Want to have conversation with someone like a normal adult? Nope someone will jump in and IMMEDIATLY start being a COMPLETE prick. I've even left to comments on on this post so you'll be able to see with your own eyes the kinds of people who play this dumpster fire of a video game. I wont even get started on the amount of Terriorist sypmathisers that pop up. Stay the hell away from this game when there are so many better options. Its to late for me I already made the mistake of wasting 35 hours on this shit.
"It was fun, not anymore.
Half the time waiting to get into a server, then another quarter to deploy because community is completly avoiding communicating so you are trapped at the base with no heffing SQUADs open, as if it wasn't the name of the game to play in SQUADS, and not just two or three in one and then lock it up. 
Oh, and did I mentioned the fact that you get a third of your time playing the game waiting for a medic to revive you instead of just giving up because you still hope for someone to understand that when you die you lose tickets and lose the game ?
Oh and by the way, I add that here. This is not a game. This is for a lot of players their life and blood. So expect a lot of yelling when you lose, expect to be kicked without warning,  expect Squad Leaders being agressive."
"Add Turkish language support You are selling to the Turkish market and you do not provide language support. 85 million people live in Turkey, 12 million of them have 20 million steam accounts"
i want a refund
not fun
"perm ban for no reason, discord mod had a toddler tantrum

I was playing in a server when I came across a group of enemy soldiers, they had no clue where I was. I shot at as many as I could (about 5) Then died. Around a minute later I had re-spawned and was walking through a field when I got kicked from the server for ""hacking"". At the time I could still play other servers.

About a week later, I logged onto steam and got an alert saying I had permanently been banned from the game. It said that a moderator or dev from the server I had been playing, had contacted the devs of squad itself and they perm banned me. My highest kill game on any server didn't even reach double digits.

I'm trying to appeal the ban but so far squad support haven't even responded."

"I've never played a game before, where trained soldiers can only run for ten seconds and handle firearms like they are overweight twelve year old children."
世外你做nm游戏呢，你老婆被曹烂了，所以没心思做好游戏吗？
fun and boring... sigh
This game blows harder than my ex wife.
"Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good game in terms of the gameplay loop; however, there is little motivation to continue playing over time. There's no form of progression to motivate further play and effort. Unless you just get off to this kind of thing, I wouldn't recommend spending anything on it because there's a high chance of seeing all the game has to offer immediately. You play for one day, and you've more or less seen the whole game unless you dive into the deep end and get into private sessions and all that. Even then though, the motivation is winning for the sake of winning; there is nothing to gain from trying or continuing to play. I would make suggestions to the developers as to how this could be tackled to further the lifespan of the game, but the game is perhaps a bit too old for such radical things."
"Last played it a few years ago and it was really fun. Just tried today with some friends, and the game forces you to watch the ~3 minute trailer from the store page before dumping me into an infinite black loading screen. Relaunching doesn't help. Verifying game integrity does nothing. I'm on the latest video drivers. I outright can't play this game anymore."
"I try to get my money back after 2 hours but steam did not give me my money back,  I think the game is more complicated than in needs to be, controls feel sooooo slow, like changing guns or going prone or using scope, why doesn't scope fill the screen?  Why do I die from a 10 foot fall?  really wish I got my money back."
"Movement in this game feels like your soldier weights as much as an elephant, stamina is enough to sprint for a short distance, scope stability is going to the moon and back, ppl constantly kicking you out of the squads especialy if they are vehicle squads that just fight over them always. tried rly hard to have fun but i just get frustrated every single time."
"Bought Squad when it was still in early access forever ago, And during that time I would have definitely recommended it to anyone looking for something a little more challenging and within the milsim realm of games alongside HLL, Arma, and many others. 

Though in the past year or so with the severe decline of this game I wouldn't even recommend downloading it on a free to play weekend. From weapon balancing decisions to the addition of useless micro transactions for cosmetics and emotes that 0% of the community asked for.

My biggest complaint with this game is the game itself, It prides itself on being a Milsim I.E Military Simulator that said why is it the soldier/ character you play as have a asthma attack after running for 20 seconds or better yet the character can't seem to shoulder a 6.5 Lbs M4 for more then 10 seconds to aim down sights... Not to mention god forbid you're in the prone with a 240 and have it setup with a bipod and squeeze out a 6-8 round burst because after that your aiming at the International Space Station. 

If you want to play a good Milsim that's also cross play Hell Let Loose.
If you want a Milsim that Is cross play that has 10x better Mod Support and 20x better game play Arma Reforger."
fuck the community banlist
Premium price for a sub par game with early 2010's graphic quality.
"stamina is ridiculously short so when engaging the enemy its like being a storm trooper!, all outdated kit, reloads and raises weapon into shoulder in 3-5 working days (its not like there's a war going on!)."
way to many cheaters with aim lock the deathcam is always hilarious to watch
stupid
"I came from playing arma reforger to this. What a mistake that was. The graphics are mediocre at best, the movement feels stiff and janky. The recoil is horrendous too. Overall it's a really bad game. Do yourself a favour and avoid this rushed mess of a game. Go buy arma reforger instead. You won't regret it."
Played Reforger for a week then came back to this and it felt like playing absolute trash. The graphics difference alone is just mind blowing. OWI has ALOTTTT of catching up to do.
"I've really tried to give it a 1h30 chance, waste of time on these most Toxic community i have ever seen."
I CANT PLAY NOTHING KICK ME FROM EVRYSERVER
Don’t get me wrong I love the core idea of the game and a lot of the mods are absolute bangers but the gameplay with all the weapon systems and vehicle mechanics are just way to floaty and janky. Essentially the recoil on the weapons in this are by far have the most punishing recoil in any game I’ve played ever played.
a piece of shit
Literally only one reason not to buy this game and that is because the devs are so stupid that they put a max volume 5 minute unskippable video at the beginning of launch talking about how the game works. Like nobody plays games now days if they don't understand the game.
stuck on a trailer and a fucking black screen for 10 days in a row this game cant even load i played it literally last week with no issues and the next week its just constantly black and playing this shitty trailer atleast over 100 times.
Remove this intro video its loud and you cant skip it
"Walking simulator. Its quite buggy, the game play is deathly slow. From what I can see there is no weapon customization. Funny community but I do not get the hype or the rating behind this game at all. 99% of the time you are walking from point a to b and when you do get into a fire fight it's over in too short of an amount of time to actually enjoy it. I regret buying this game."
ICO SUCKS more balls than a thai street walker
"I was a fan of Squad since the alpha version (2017), but now I do not recommend wasting time on this game. The developers completely changed the game design in 2023, so most reviews are no longer relevant.
	•	The game is priced like a AAA title, yet its graphics and physics are stuck in the mid-2010s. Heavy vehicles are jumping while driving offroad.
•	There is NO DESTRUCTION AT ALL, EVEN LITTLE WOODEN FENCES ARE STATIC. It gets ridiculous when you’re driving a tank and get stopped by a tiny bush or a low wooden fence. At the same time, collisions don’t damage vehicles at all. Not to mention that mortars and tanks can fire at a small clay house (on Middle Eastern maps) for 10 minutes straight, and the house remains completely intact while the squad inside takes no damage.
	•	The shooting mechanics are unrealistic and clunky since 2023. The shooting in the trailer here in product page is fake, but devs keep it for years now. Now the weapon always shakes and when someone shoots at you, the screen goes dark. hitting the enemy has become more difficult and less realistic (I am an ex-soldier). The developers attempted to add “realism” by making the crosshair sway uncontrollably when a soldier is exhausted, yet in 10 years (since the alpha release in 2015), they never implemented a proper weapon resting mechanic. Only bipod-equipped weapons have any form of stabilization.
	•	No looting at all. AMMO IS LIMITED ­­– NO FUN SHOOTINGS, and you can only resupply at the main base or a FOB – if some selfless player sacrifices their fun to drive a logistics truck for you. When you respawn, you get the same amount of ammo you had at the time of death. You can’t even pick up extra ammo from fallen teammates who had the same weapon as you. There is no trophy system for enemy weapons either.
	•	Despite its pseudo-realism, you can’t hear enemy voice comms even if they’re speaking loudly right next to you – whether in local chat or over the radio. You also can’t capture enemy radios.
	•	The addition of modern factions has led to visual confusion. Many teams now have nearly identical camo patterns, making it difficult to distinguish friend from foe at a distance. You can even have NATO vs. NATO matches, where both sides look the same and sound the same because they use the same weapons.

Luckily, it’s 2025, and Squad now has competitors with better game design and graphics for the same price. I don’t consider Squad to be a true AAA title, despite the way it mimics one. It’s neither a casual shooter where you can just have fun, nor a hardcore mil-sim. There are no vanilla casual servers, where you have enough ammo to not think how to save bullets (remember, looting isn't available, no ammo resupply on respawn), the screen doesn't go dark when someone shoots to your side and weapons don't shake TOO MUCH."
밀스퍼거 병신 장앨녀들 존나 많노
ICO update ruined the game. Unplayable. No need to say more.
"Great Game
full of bugs and janky settings plz fix"
"Not recommended.
The wait time ""queue"" is way to long. Even going to an empty server the queue time is to long. We buy games in order to play, not to look at a screen with fancy distractions.
Game is not worth $50.00. Not even $5.00 for a game that does not do what it says it  does."
Absolute garbage. STAY AWAY from this pile of monkey crap
"-novid doesnt work, shit game

11.02.25 -novid still does not work and the most retarded trailer has been added to the intro
you guys dont ""... bridge the gap..."" between anyting. 1 out of 10 games got teamplay, the rest is just very nice arabs that dont know basic game mechanics after 911 hours playing"
walking simulator
"The price tag made me expect good graphics and good UI.
Though the gameplay is probably not bad, I can't really play it atm because the graphics are too distracting.

Might edit this review later"
"You can shoot guns like a 12 year old boy and sway your noodle arms crazy.
Also the game runs really bad with a lot of performance issues.

Otherwise, it's a great game."
shit nigga game my squad drove on a car without me and when i gestured them they just sprayed me with gatling on their car and i died
"very bad with fps, i have way stronger specs than requirements and its constantly at 30 to 40 fps, i feel robbed.

several updates later and my 3090 and i9 desktop still drops below 50 fps ..... :x"
"This game used to be really fun. Probs my most favorite PvP shooter of all time. Ever since the ICO it is absolutely abysmal. Getting random weapon sway because you are being suppressed or not have enough stamina is the worse imaginable effect I have seen in any game ever. There are other ways to slow the game down or make suppression usefull and this is not it. I like being able to aim my gun where I want to and not have it move randomly on its own. It literally feels like someone is moving a second mouse on your PC randomly and you are trying to fight them. Also lets talk about PiP scopes. First and foremost going from 80 fps to 40 for simply ADS. A problem we never had before that exists now for no reason. Or maybe realism that no one cares. At least not in the cost of frames. On top of the fact that the scopes cover most of your screen. I can sit here and say real life this life that all day but at the end of the day the game feels horrible to play because of the gun play/firefights alone and I don't care what the arguement is.  There is games that feel good to play and shoot in them like RoN, Arma 3, Ground Branch, even old Squad and then there is squad today which just feels horrible to play."
Game is random crashing even tho i have god pc
Game starts in the incorrect aspect ratio and I am unable to navigate to the setting menu to change it
Wanted to be in a Squad
"gone to shit especially in oceana, don't touch this game with a 10 foot pole"
Makers of this game have never driven a vehicle especially a quadbike in their lives.
"Good game, toxic community usually."
shit game!
"This game looks fun, until you get rolled by sweating tryhards, or solo rats who play this game like they are john mclaine."
die simulator
unskippable intro makes me want to just delete the game off my account this is the most annoying crap ive had to deal with for opening 1 stupid game i couldnt care less about what the intro video tells me
slop
In a game that requires your mic you'd assume you could use a mic just like any other game. My mic worked for years on this game and then it stopped randomly. Online it said i had to download a virtual audio cable to get it to work which his already stupid since its a mic that works on literally every other game. The virtual cable worked for about two days and now nothing I do makes the game recognize my headset. Hell let loose recognizes it tho.
"I truly love this game but I really think it needs to improve , the only reason i put this review as ""not recommended"" is for my complains to be seen thus I DO RECOMMEND this game i think you should try it out. my complains are pretty much the lack of gore elements and bloodshed, absence of certain animations, and physics. and it bothers me, really.
this game is a REALISTIC shooter game, and it stands on that ground pretty well, but who wouldnt love to see bloody hands, uniforms, bloodshed here and there, or even dirty muddy guns and uniforms? 
who wouldnt love seeing when a anti tank mine blows up, the tank be lifted upwards by the force, get visible damage on the sides? permanent hole on the ground maybe?
and certain animations we could benefit from, i can mention grabbing a fallen soldier body to safety, entering/dismounting a vehicle animation, mortar reloading animation
these things i believe would most definitely improve my experience, for sure there are more things we can have, i checked ""Allow comments"" box if you guys have more interesting ideas relating to this topic i would love to read it.
but here is something that MOST DEFINITELY needs to be added, a second voice option for ""Call Medic"" where the character doesnt yell and is more quiet call, would be great!, digging trenches is also good to have, imagine a whole squad shoveling to dig a trench lol
I hope the best for this game."
"These bitches wants a steam award, guys your game's gameplay and game character physics sucks. ARMA 3 is way better uninstalling this shit game"
Honestly idk why the reviews are so good for this game. It is incredibly clunky compared to others in the same genre.
ICO made the whole game unplayable.
Running simulator
The downloading and updating times and problems are new and make the game completely not worth it as someone with a solid amount of time in game the gameplay is awesome but that only matters if you can get in game.
"This game that requires alot of time to learn how to play you cant just turn your mind off and run around. The tutorial isn't up to snuff to teach new players and the community (fairly) doesnt have time to teach ya the ropes. I can see once you learn the game that it would be an exciting and fun game, but that learning difficulty curve needs to be addressed by the devteam.  Maybe making an option for newbs for them to play single player against bots similar to what operation harsh doorstep does,  so they can learn the ropes. Otherwise it would be a long grind to learn the game, letting down your team mates as you learn everything.  I got my refund to the game because the learning curve is too steep."
Not fun. Arma is better.
every single server its unfriendly to new players..totally disaster..they buy this crap and they thing they are godfathers now who can be toxic and stupid to all new players..disaster from community.. your parents miss when they grow such a racist kids like you are.. shame on your parents work !!
iF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GAME THAT HAS 0 OPTIMIZATION YOUVE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE... also if you wanna get down a building watch out for invisible awnings and doors.
"This game is many things. Fun, thats not."
"This game is full of Virgins. Spend the whole time being kicked from every available squad for absolutely no reason, to the point i didn't actually get to experience the gameplay."
I run around for ten minutes. I get shot at. I look around for a while and don't see anything. I die. Every time. You move slow and clunky. Can't refund. Don't Play.
"i would refund if i could, i had 1 hour along time ago and I refunded bc I couldn't run the game and was stuck in it for 1 hour now I have the game again bc I got a better PC and the game sucks and now I have more than 2 hours and I cant refund it, games ass"
"TERRIBLE OPTIMIZATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RTX 3090 + 5900X + 2K + ALL LOW = 30FPS average

WTF?"
Squad is the kind of game you have to hate yourself to enjoy. It just is not fun.
"60 hours in, and I still never see the people shooting me. Play if you like spending and hour doing nothing, for 30 minutes of spawning and dieing immediately over and over again."
"its changed for the worse its not the same and the gameplay is shit, servers are either dead or half dead"
"Squad honestly just isn't really fun. It suffers from the same issues Hell Let Loose has, but more magnified. If you spawn away from the fight or your squad you're gonna spend a lot of time hoofing it across the map just to get to a fight, and whenever you do get to the fight you die before you even realize what's happening.
Sure, it's 'realistic' but it's generally a negative experience running around only to get killed in .2 seconds.
The ticket system seems to make most matches turn into 'who can score the most kills from across the map to win""
It's not fun running around reviving dudes while you're being completely suppressed for something like 30 minutes straight.
Also the community is either ""lets ban you for not wanting to play squad lead"" to ""Yeah man, a good piece of advice is to look up factions fatigues"" so if you're planning on playing this game solo expect an irksome time there. I think to actually enjoy this game you need a full squad of people to coordinate anything, which even then, only really mediates the admin side of the game's issues.
Just pickup insurgency, HLL or even Tarkov if you want a more enjoyable experience. At least with those games you'll actually be playing a *game* 
Lastly, the game does indeed run like crap, I love stuttering whenever I get shot, to make my suppression even more irritating to experience."
"This game is by no means enjoyable by any standard. I bought this game back in the day before i could run it and since getting a good computer I tried to play it. In my attempt to play this game i can say that the community is one of the worst I've ever experienced in my life, its worse than COD hell even worse than CS2. The servers are usually run by clans with power abusing admins and even though a server might say ""new player friendly"" they are anything but. I tried running a few matches with my buddy only to have my class stripped from me while in the middle of a fire fight with a server warning covering my screen telling me ""you're not a high enough level to use this class"" or ""You will be banned in 2 minutes if you do not join a squad (keep in mind all squads were full) so i was left high and dry with no gun and no ammo surrounded by enemies. If you play and enjoy this garbage congrats! but if you're looking to get into it don't bother unless you're a sadist or masochist."
"Game was great. Has been flooded with new players that think its CoD, not worth playing anymore unfortunately. I and several SL's agree and have hung the game up for the next few months.

Amazing game, when its played right (communicate, coordinate) as the intro video explains..."
"This game is branded as a tactical shooter, but it is not. It feels like a slightly more tactical Battlefield which is fine, if you like that gameplay but I do not."
This game runs like the slowest kid in fat camp for it looking so generic generic  0/10
"I deeply regret purchasing this game. The online gameplay is nothing like the advertised experience, and the community feels lifeless, offering no support to new players or fostering the teamwork the game is supposedly designed for.

Squad’s core gameplay revolves around fighting a war alongside a squad of up to nine players, including a squad leader responsible for directing members and placing map markers for infantry, vehicles, and bases.

Unfortunately, due to the stale and unwelcoming community, nearly every squad leader locks their squads at the start of a round, allowing only friends or experienced players to join. This leaves new players unable to properly participate unless they create their own squad and take on the squad leader role—a daunting and frustrating experience for beginners, which often results in backlash from other players due to a lack of experience.

The gameplay itself consists largely of frustration. You’ll spend most of your time getting shot at, causing your screen to darken and blur, rendering you effectively blind about 75% of the time before dying. Upon respawning, you'll often find yourself far from the objective, with vehicles locked to squad leaders, forcing you to run long distances just to get back into the action. Once there, you're likely to be taken out again by infantry hiding in bushes at long distances or the overwhelming number of enemy tanks, repeating the same tedious cycle.

In my 12 hours of play, I’ve only encountered three enemy soldiers. The rest of my time was spent crawling toward objectives and getting shot at from no where or getting shelled while attempting to build bases. Match queues are excessively long—expect to wait over 10 minutes in a 25-player line just to join one of the few active servers. The matches themselves are disappointingly short, with most of your time spent running around, only for the game to end suddenly due to an invisible scoring system.

The logistics element is simplistic and repetitive, involving nothing more than driving a truck from one point to another. There’s no weapon or loadout customization to add variety or depth to the experience.

You’d be far better off investing in games like Arma 3, Reforger, or Foxhole. 
Squad is a hollow, frustrating experience that pretends to be a deep mil-sim by simply blinding you whenever you’re shot. I deeply regret purchasing this game—it’s nothing like the advertised experience, and the unhelpful, unwelcoming community completely undermines any potential for enjoyable gameplay."
bad
"Ich habe mir Squad zugelegt, weil ich als Arma 3 Spieler so langsam nicht mehr auf die alte Grafik von Arma klar komme. Da liefert Squad extrem ab. Super realistische Grafik.  Allerdings war der Hauptgrund für mich der teamplay Aspekt. Anders als angepriesen, habe ich den in 4 Stunden Gameplay nicht gefunden. 

- Es gibt zu wenig deutsche Server und man sitzt teilweise 30 Minuten oder mehr in ner Warteschlange und 
   kann nur joinen, wenn der Server eine neue Map wählt und sowieso alle neu connecten.

- Die squadleader unter denen ich gespielt habe, verstehen nicht wie man kommuniziert, bzw. geben keine Befehle aus. Besonders nervig, wenn man einen Server joint, der ""new player friendly"" in der Beschreibung stehen hat.  Letztendlich bin ich einfach anderen hinterher gelaufen aber nie meinem Squad. Man sitzt zusammen in einer Deckung, dreht sich um und alle sind auf ein mal weg. Anstatt kurz über voice zu sagen dass man die Stellung wechselt, wird hier einfach drauf geschissen.  Die meisten Leute sind außerdem so inkompetent in dem Spiel, dass sie nicht dazu in der Lage sind den Kompass zu benutzen um Gegner zu callen aber haben alle ein riesen Ego, fühlen sich wie die geilsten. Wie immer hier die deutsche community super cringe, absolute Testosteronbude die anscheinend von 50 Jahre alten, 4 mal geschiedenen Dudes zum kompensieren gespielt wird.  Das was das Spiel ausmacht, nämlich die Squad-Mechanik wird in der Kommunikation absolut nicht ausgenutzt. Dementsprechend bezieht sich der so angepriesene Realismus hier eher auf das Aussehen des Spiels und Gunplay, beides Faktoren die super umgesetzt sind. 
Alles in allem ist Squad zudem extrem langweilig. Rumsitzen, in eine Richtung starren aus der vielleicht mal jemand kommen könnte... 

Technisch könnte das Spiel definitv noch nachlegen. Mit einem 5800 X3D und einer 3080 in WQHD und Mid/High settings habe ich knapp 120 fps erreicht, bis ich die Optik auf meiner Waffe benutzt habe. Die werden Picture in Picture gerendert und das führt zu extremen Fps einbrüchen bis in die 60er. 

Fazit: Ich habe von Squad anderes erwartet. Dynamischeres Teamplay. Aber ich bin durch Arma auch Milsim
verwöhnt, dementsprechend bin ich nicht unbiased. 

Bin leider 4 Stunden im Spiel gewesen, dementsprechend kein Refund. Pech gehabt. 

Kauft euch Arma Reforger und installiert mods. Habt ihr mehr von und die Community is netter!"
"This game could be great if it had a few more weapons and a little bit of customization, have to be very patient to play."
The mic issues with this game can make it hard to play. Theres compatibility issues in this game when it works on your device. Game also has a very difficult screen rate. Other than that its a fun game.
lol
"Great game, but the community has gone to shit. Constant trolling, and people not working together/communicating has made what used to be my favorite game into my least favorite. Free weekends and discounts on the game have completely ruined it."
Honestly it just keeps randomly kicking me from games and its frustrating to enjoy it then be kicked every game
Just go play Arma 3 instead
"Poorly optimized, glitchy and overall bad game. Too many European servers with stinky ping and really poop communities that literally ban you for no reason. So the idea of the game is to encourage being toxic? Wow, never thought a developer would go that low. Although I only played it for a little bit, I really don't recommend. I had a horrible experience on multiple servers. I tried to like it and I tried to look beyond the flaws but there's too many. Go for Arma."
arma reforger is better this is just a  temu version of it
Надеюсь у фанатов этой игры всё хорошо.
only good with mods
"was great game when it is working, came back to it after a break and now game is unplayable. cant skip intro video and ue4 crashes, no known permanent fix exists per google searching. wish could get money back."
"A lot of people seem to like this game but I found it pretty boring, not how the gameplay videos make it out to be at all."
devs gobble lady cock
"Be prepared to be head shot 500m away, while you cant see further then 20 yards with your scope. The gun sway is excessive and you cant walk further then 10 yards without being gassed."
not very good game
"1. Badly optimized, extremely VRAM hungry, crashed every time during map change and twice during matches with error something something ran out of VRAM (minimum on the store page is 4GB, I have 6).

Using:
-12th gen i7-12700H
-16GB RAM
-M2 SSD drive
-RTX 3060 laptop gpu (6GB dedicated VRAM)
I would say there is something wrong with my laptop and not the game, but games like Helldivers 2 with highier requirements run flawlessly + 1 of my friends has the same issue. Ran the game on lowest settings, with and without DLSS.

2.If you want to play the game with friends, and you do want to play this game with friends, you need to find a server with a few open slots, 90% of servers are either full or dead. This means that 9 out of 10 times if you want to play an actual game you have to wait in queue. Server hosts can and do introduce a paid priority queue that skips the main queue entirely (even though every other implementation of such system I've seen in my life takes 1 person from priority then 1 from main and so on so people in main aren't just stuck in there forever. How does Squad deal with this problem? It doesn't.) If the server you want to join is full, or, God forbid, you crashed mid game (perhaps due to running out of VRAM even though you have more than in minimum requirements, nah that would never happen) you are stuck waiting for a good 20 minutes (1 match) and if you somehow manage to not die from old age and join, the game ends, map changes AND DURING LOADING IT F*****G CRASHES AGAIN, OUT OF VRAM ERROR MY A** I HAVE 6 GIGS YOU SAY 4 RIGHT THERE ON THE STORE PAGE, UNIRONICALLY 2.5 OUT OF 3 HOURS I HAVE IN THIS GAME WAS SPENT IN QUEUE.

3.So I spent the refund period in queues. (I don't want to refund the game, I'm just pointing that fact out, still want to try playing when I get round to buying a PC). That wouldn't happen if I got to test the game made for playing with friends through family share, a steam feature that explicitly doesn't allow you to play with the copy owner. So what is the problem? Why didn't I do it? Because for no f****** reason family share is disabled. WHERE IS THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST?? If I want to play with my friend I still have to purchase a separate copy!

4.So this is my 3 argument essay on why you should play Roblox Multicrew Tank Combat instead (It actually has a batter vehicle damage model, which in Squad is pretty basic). Game still better than Hell Let Loose though."
I love playing this game but it literally doesn't run on my computer(not performance issues). Upon starting the game it instantly stops responding in task manager and plays the shitty intro cinematic while infinitely loading yet nothing is bottle necking and I don't believe its my computer I have a 3060ti 32gb ram and an i9-10900KF. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling many times verifying game files and yes my drivers are up to date. I hope that this issue is fixed so that I am able to play again. Also I am on windows ten I haven't switched yet but I don't think that would solve my issue.
"Is it hard to make a game work? like for real? Finding servers is a pain in the ass and it sometimes work. You waste 15 minutes of finding servers after you wasted 2 hours trying to fix the game yourself browsing Reddit or any other site to find a solution to the ,,no servers found"" shit.  AND AFTER THAT, YOU FUCK AROUND WITH ANOTHER BUG, THE ONE THAT WRITES ,,UNABLE TO JOIN SERVER SESSION. and at this point you wasted not only your money, but time.  

0 wasted hours out of 10"
"When I first purchased this game, it was fantastic. Now, with each new update and hotfix, I experience more and more issues. They recently added a hotfix that makes it so I am unable to join any servers, and half of the time, none of the servers even appear despite several refreshes. I cannot recommend this game in it's current state."
"game costs 50 bucks and cant even load into a server, if you can even find one. Trash"
LOL
this game is so trash for vehicle combat due to the trees being invincible and the rocks being the most slippery surface man ever encountered
No in game Audio...

downloaded and voice chat does not work cant talk to my squad and i tried everything to get it to work very shit game
"PLEASE read this… if you are looking for a strategy and team work game this is perfect. In contrast this game is not to be played for fun unless you have fun doing that. if you are looking for a open world shooter where you drive and loot and kill people then you need to get dayz or call of duty dmz this game is fine, but it’s very difficult to play and have fun if your not really into strategy games"
"i highly recommend to avoid this game.

Its is a fun game to actually play, its just the other people that play it that ruin the experience. i really tried to enjoy the game but i just couldn't because of the man babies that get pissed off if you don't do something they say. And then if you start to ignore said man babies you get turned into Abraham Lincoln by getting shot in the back of the head by said man babies."
this game sucks
fix your game from crashing out
"Don't ever join a 1stRB server, or 3rd, ever, such dogshit admins on there that will give a 7 day ban for accidentally typing in all chat about your HAB when it was intended for Squad, then it fucks you on every other server even though they have zero connection, the whole communitybanlist is such a stupid fucking idea it ruins everything."
WTF WHY DO U GET KICKED FOR JUST GETTING IN VEHICLE 2 man crew KITS SUCK FAT GIGA CUCKS PLEASE WTF BEST GAMEIVE EVER HAD ABOUT TO LOSE AND I JUST NEEDED TO GET A VEHICLE TO ANOTYHER PART OF THE MAP BUTY NO SQUAD TELLS U NO U HAVE TO START RUNNING LIKE BITCH FUCK U SQUAD BUT ALSO LOVE U FUCKS IRS IS COMPLICATED
"As a new player who played similar games such as Hell let lose the game is bad. For me the UI is complicated, there are no on screen markers which makes it very difficult for me to navigate, and I can't see the difference between teammate and enemy. I don't want to take hours to sit and learn uniforms and what are the key differences! Don't even get me started on the gun play... It's god awful since your ""soldier"" has the arm strength of a newborn baby. It's like he has gummy worms for arms. Gun play is not realistic at all and that's coming form a guy that's been in the special forces. Aiming with scopes is a pain in the ass and the bullet spread is horrendous. It's like shooting confetti, not bullets. Optimization wise A HUGE CATASTROPHE. I have a very high end PC and I get huge frame drops. On Cyberpunk for example at max settings with ray tracing I get around 90-100 FPS in 4K, but on this game I have 20 at times. HOW? Would not recommend to anyone."
F the people who play this
Not Recommended
go play battlefield or go play arma insurgancy any other game this game isnt worth it
"terrible game cant see anything scopes take up your whole screen and if you use a iron sight good luck its 90% of your screen. movement is wack, and the key bindings are horrible. hell let loose is 100% better"
hell let loose is much better.
It could be a good game if it wasn't so terribly optimised.
"the game is cool, but matches take too long start"
"where am i, who is that, im dead"
Played this game for a long time and it was my favorite shooter with the best tactical elements that i couldnt find anywhere else. I stopped playing just before the ICO. Now reinstalling the game i cant get past the 10 minute intro video to play the game. it goes thru the video then just stays a black loading screen forever. Restarting causes the video to replay and its unskippable. Unplayable for me.
dogshit performance
KRSH
"game is a cpu vampire, really good and fun gameplay but if you dont have a top tier cpu ur not gonna get more than 60 frames, no matter the settings"
Community is cancer
fucking hate this game i wanted a refound and they waited so long that its not even posible now
"very first game got yelled at for a player because i didnt know what to do.

1/10 would never play again."
"I really want to like this game, but every match is filled with locked squads or filled ones. Probably a lot of fun if you have friends or can actually get into a squad."
"I like this game and the modding scene but hackers are taking over this game and makes it unplayable.  I don't even understand why they're doing it but they are, almost every other match or every match people are being shot through walls, the next points are already known and so you can't defend them.  I really hope they work on the anti cheat in this game because what ever team has the hacker(s) is winning normally.  A close friend even shut down his server for squad because he started having to ban hackers every day and instead of it being a fun let's hop on the server it became he had to monitor it all the time so it didn't become a dead server since in the last year hackers just keep springing up.  Love the game but something needs to be done about the hackers in this."
Hell Let Loose if it was bad
"Of course, it has interesting and positive aspects, but mixed with many ridiculous and irrealistic elements and as a game it's unnecessarily overcomplicated. But the worst part is the typically cocky, toxic players.

However, on the whole it gives back realisticly what it is usually like to serving in an army:

Serving in an army is usually extremely tiresome, miserable, unfair, or at the best it's highly boring."
"Mediocre at best. Game is incredibly slow both in gameplay and physically with characters and vehicles. Roles at so restrictive its punitive, and anything that isnt a basic rifleman or vehicle oriented classes is snagged immediately. 

I gave this game so many chances, and it just plain SUCKS. Don't waste your money, this game is just for military n3rds creaming their pants over proper camo patterns for different nations."
ICO ruined it for me. No matter how you slice it its just a worse experience than before.
servers dont show up ive tried 4 times the last year and not a single server. i shouldnt have to fix shit in your game for it to work. dont waste your money
forgot to refund this :steamsad:
"can't distinguish much from my squad or enemy, I hate TK my squad, fix this SHIT!"
fully ruined the combat shooting feels like im holding my gun one handed. make squad great again
"I bought squad and im new to game, I accidentally tk some people but in my end i was apologize but when i try to load into servers it auto kicks me and tells me im vac banned? Is this how the game treats New players?"
worse than squad 44 that's for sure
"It's no longer the game I spent countless hours on, I don't recommend purchasing it. For those looking for a simulator, look elsewhere."
shit ico
"suppression, ADS idle sway +3000%"
"Why am I not seeing any servers?

Squad 44 the servers show right away.

In this its just endless loading or a loop"
"[h1] Extra toxic game [/h1]

This is a multiplayer game, the player base resembles Red Dead Online RP. That's enough said for people who know."
"This game is not worth 50$.
It runs very poorly and only the explosion particles look good.
This game also has no decent Anti Aliasing , you either get none or TAA which makes everthing blurry including your scope."
bad optimization clunkily movement that is a chore to deal with. clunky horrible slow animations that are infuriating to deal with. a wannabe hyper realistic shooter
"looks like a fun game. But i have entered 14 different servers and just cant seem to play it normally my ping is around 35 to 50 yet i cant seem to walk anywhere without going back where i started after 10 seconds maybe i have gone 2 meters but it is unplayable.

if you read this and can help me with this problem please do i would like to play the game until then i would not recommend the game as you can probably understand because now for me at least its a waste of money"
"can yall make it so i 100% know who the enemy is, my first game today ive had died everytime becuase i keep thinking the enemies are my squad mates. the only difference is are the guns..."
sosal
"Saw all the hype and influencers promoting this game so I finally bought it on sale. Regret. 

It's basically a stripped down, poor man's version of BF3/BF4. The movement, weapons handling, and everything else about the game is cheap and clunky, even vaulting over a small wall is a challenge. This game is inconsistently semi-realistic, meaning your teammates will have ally tags above their head, but not all the time, and not when they are more than 20ft away. Also if they enter a room you're in, the tag will only appear after a few seconds. Why don't the developers just leave the tags, or remove them completely? Because of this lazy design, teamkills are a normal thing, and the only solution is to open your map overlay every few seconds to keep track of allies. Wow that's so realistic. It's worse that modern armies are featured, so all the uniforms look exactly the same. In the forum, players talk about how to distinguish the subtle colours and equipment smh. 

A big thing that I was looking forward to were all the mods that the influencers have been pushing, but it's a scam. Unlike Battlefield, this game HAS NO PUBLIC SERVERS. Yes that's right. There are only a small amount of  privately run ones, by 'clans' smh. Want to play the zombie mode? Fat chance because nobody runs that server anymore. It only exists on youtube. The developers obviously paid alot of influencers to push this. How did we regress so badly, and how are people supporting this? The gunplay and gameplay is also crap. When you get shot at, your screen shakes violently, turns black, and goes out of focus for several seconds. Killing enemies does not feel satisfying either, maybe with the major ICO nerf, it just took all the feeling out of everything.

Weapon balance is also crap, most loadouts do not have any anti armour weapons. If you do choose a class with a basic rpg, the game will penalize that class and take away your holo scope for example. This game is simply not fun or realistic either. Don't even buy this at 95% off. Getting a refund now. 

ps - For the poop icing on the flavourless sponge cake? It crashes randomly too. Good job."
Optimization is suck.i have 4060ti 8gb and ryzen 5 7600f medium graphic sometimes i see 40fps. but good
"Experiences with player base were horrid, constantly coming across toxic people who are just not pleasant what so ever. Particularly as a new player, I just got fucked with and treated awful."
"Can't recommend the game until they rework the awful flight model, add basic QOL improvements like choosing which seat to enter, fix the utterly frustrating bipod mechanics, and rework at least one of the several abandoned game modes.
The game is extremely resource heavy and regularly crashes due to OOM, consuming 16gb of memory just to load some levels. Of course, enjoy waiting for another 20 minutes to queue into the server after that crash. 
Another basic aspect is that being a squad leader feels like a thankless and frustrating task without much of any infrastructure to command and control besides pointing at a location."
needs allot of optimisation it's unplayable in some maps and servers
"Стреляешь из пулемёта - пули летят куда угодно кроме цели. Тебя ранят в транспорте, полечить себя в нём нельзя. В тебя кто-то попал, игра нек показывает стрелочку откуда прилетело. Как минимум в жизнт я понимаю что прилетает в левую руку. Бред."
"j'y ai joué 4 heures pour 27 crashes, je recommande pas"
It was fun when it worked but now I cant play modded anymore because it makes me stuck in this stupid trailer.
Servers don't load
IT IS HARD EXP HOW DO YOU PAGE UP FOR YOUR TEMATES.
>:(
Imagine making a game about being in a Squad but you can't get in a Squad with a friend without RNG. Yeah good job autistic devs.
You can't drive over the pedestrian! Fuck it
"definitely not the game i was expecting. trash teams, cant identify who your enemy is, and the fact that you cant pick up left over ammo and other things of that nature of dead bodies is obsured. horrible game"
"Worse than Arma, the scope is constantly shaking, you can't see anything, the community is inadequate and toxic. Also constant freezes on 7 9700x and 4070 xddddddd"
i have the recommended specs for this game yet i only manage to get 40 to 50 fps this game is poorly optimized
"Waited the 17 hours you see above this review waiting for the game to load in
I was really goddamn hoping to play the star wars mod but i guess that won't happen"
"The game is too poorly optimized and is having FPS issues, as well as some issue with black screen, FPS drops and poor performace EVEN IN THE LOWEST SETTING WITH SUPER LOW END GRAPHICS.

I have other newer games with better visuals then this one and none of them consumed as much reasources as this game, so the issue has to be on this game in particular.

According to a friend of mine, this issue came after some infantry-centered patch and something that was done on it that made the game far more demanding and less optimized.

Well, i want to get back at this game in the future, but for the moment, i'm refunding it."
"Wait, run, die, wait, run, die. Walking/waiting sim 2006"
i have UEA 4 crash ??
Dont try if you use a xbox controller as it may say it has support but it doesnt.
no
"honestly a fun game it really is but when u cant find any matches it makes u not wanna play, the server browser is absolutely  terrible it loads maybe every once in a while, finding a match itself through the ""find match"" option?? i tried everything google said and to no avail it did not work. if u can get the game to play its fun, maybe they will fix it soon"
ث
"Painful to play

I just bought this game for 20 on a sale, load it up all excited, get through the tutorials, then I get into the actual game where I have to suffer from severe stuttering. I keep trying to fix this which led me to write this review warning people about buying this game. Graphics issue after graphics issue, I find myself losing it due to the fact that I would need a PC that would put NASA's administrator on his knees and in tears.

My PC runs on Windows 11, I have an AMD Ryzen 5 5500 processor with 3.60 GHz. One more thing that I have is 16 GB of RAM installed in this PC. But the biggest thing to say and what has a connection with this game is that, this system struggles to maintain FPS and have good performance or my performance is good, but the environment looks like it was made out of clay, same with the people I am playing this game with. 

I tried to reach out to support via email, but I didn't get a response yet. I just you to take the 20 dollars and buy some other game with it, that you know it will run and it will run well.

If you have any solutions for this madness as my PC has no more slots for RAM, please write this down in the comments and help me out as I don't really want to just give up on this game."
I had factories in factorio better optimized than this game
Отличный симулятор больного тремором!!!
have to have a people who play or u never have fun and after 10 hours just trying to find a team regret
camping and running simulator
"I wouldn't buy this game until you try it out in a free to play weekend.
Not enough time to explore what the game has to offer within the refund period.

What I did find out in my small amount of play time is that there were 4 main servers for AU for new players, each having quite a large wait queue time, or you can join a server with 4 people and accomplish nothing. I spent 20 minutes waiting to join a server.

There is no customisation for load-outs and certain settings server or mode based limit class types.
I like limiting class types within squads but no across all squads.

No customisation feels so bad, 3 predetermined rifleman load-outs and I hate every single scope forced option, the good thing about most other shooters is you can fiddle around to choose a scope to your personal preferred visual clarity.
I unfortunately can't look past this 1 thing regardless of everything else.

I also felt like this was a safe buy to try due to high positive review counts but it appears the developers within their discord made promises to release ""leaked"" future content screenshots if players updated their negative reviews to positive, perhaps from the insulting DLC's. DLC's which are gun skins fixed to map type for ""keeping it realistic"". Wouldn't by their own claims that this would mean that skins should be different to all guns and armour per map type by the default game design and not a paid for option? But I guess this is what happens when a company sells out to Tencent.

TLDR: Wait for free weekend. Not enough time actually try the game out properly."
It won't let you load in the game most of the time.
i give the game chance after chance and still it is dogshit
Known issues with the cinematic being unable to be skipped without deleting files.
just another bullshit serverlist war game
"blinding suppression and noodle hands, and creepy ppl believe that this helps for teamwork while actually you become a bunch of noodle handed snails trying to play team-play tactics that actually ending by getting blown and in the end of match you check tab to see that 60% of players have 0 kills and lot of deaths, GE mod is the only light in this game."
Doesn't scratch the military shooter itch.
"well there weren't many players from my region so i had to compromise and join one where i had over 80 ping
the server had 90+ player but after capturing 3 points and playing for almost a hour never saw any enemy
and when i was abt to leave some dude just sniped 3-4 of us instantly and we didnt knew where the shots were from

not recommended for new players
play battlfield games for better experience
was a waste of time because i have refunded it"
"I was really interested in this game, but after installing and running, it the game had no sound after the intro, only popping noises.  Tried verifying game files, and following other solutions I found online, but nothing worked.  I saw other people with similar problems who never got support on the forums or from the developers, so I requested a refund.  Not spending forever trying to fix it."
The game stutters and runs poorly; I can't play it because it's poorly optimized.
borings its a walking sim dont get it
Mic doesnt work and these guys dont want to either fix it or give you any kind of instant link to customer support to help you through it. Its just internet searches to no end with no solution.
"shit game, need COOP or BOT. those players are toxic."
no way this is popular
doesn't have jiggle physics
"Absolutely terrible. Takes forever to get into a game with decent ping, and then if you don't know what you're doing it is the most confusing game I have ever played. Only buy if you have someone who knows what they are doing. Otherwise not worth the money even if it is on sale."
"10 bad boring games where my squad will run around the map for 1 hour before losing for every 1 good fun game, im getting tired of it"
Performance despite exceeding recommended Specs
"Mostly Russians who demand you have a mic to communicate. I was kicked from servers with the reasoning being that I'm a troll, when in reality, I'm just new and trying to learn the game. I requested a refund."
"This game is pure trash

used to be good a few years ago

the ICO - infantry combat overhaul has made the weapons EXTREMELY unrealistic

you can just google the recoil patterns, but when you fire an M4, in game, it literally, and i mean LITERALLY, kicks to the sky. this is not an over-exaggeration

an M4, in real life, has little recoil, just like every other ar-15 platform rifles. in squad, PVP is pure RNG, the stamina system giving your character parkinsons is also another horrible implementation. in squad, its about whoever just sits prone in a random spot.

there is no skill, there is no fun. 

just go play Hell Let Loose, that game has ACTUAL proper gunplay."
looked very fun. but i was not able to join any servers to play. so i had to refund the game. luckily the in game micro transaction store still worked..........
"Got the game, hoping to play Galactic Contention. Do all the steps and then search up the required tag in the server browser. Never shows up. I looked on their Discord and found you may need to repeatedly spam refresh for it to work as apparently the server browser doesn't work. Ok, so I decided to check first if I try to browse without the mod installed and search something to see if the issue persists.. It does... Ok I sit there for 2 minutes clicking refresh, leave for 16 minutes to make food and come back to it loading... Ok I sit there for another 5 spamming refresh to no avail after multiple restarts and then it dawned on me that I bought a finger cramping simulator.

BS that an issue that has been around for apparently months hasn't been resolved.

Edit: After a long while, I came back to the game and it worked this time (hurrah), base game itself seems decent enough. Not something that would keep me personally. However, the Star Wars mod Galactic Contention is brilliantly done and definitely made purchasing Squad worth it."
"IDK, i would play this game way more often if the weapon and recoil system just didn't suck as bad. Like your'e telling me if i hipfire my weapon, by the third shot im hitting the ceiling 5 feet infront of me? I would have to be looking straight down to control my recoil enough to actually hit my target. Whether you can manage to ignore the bad recoil system or not, a bad recoil system is still a bad recoil system. Doesnt change what it is if you just cope with it. I just want my shots to land in the same zip code without having to look at the ground to make it happen."
1 hour was enough for me to see that this game is absolute dog water. Why is vehicle movement so awful? Why does it take 10 seconds to aim down sight? This game may be the FURTHEST milsim shooter I have ever played. You're better off play Reforger.
"I didn't get hooked on it; a lot of my mates love the game, but it felt to me that you need many hours in before it becomes fun. Maybe I'll come back to it another time, put in those hours, and see if this is true."
Game crashes every time I try to do just about anything
"I love Squad but I cannot in all rights and principles give it a good review, the dev's have ran it into the ground and back peddled on every single aspect. Performance, Game play, Everything. You name it. Its gone completely downhill!"
make sure you have friends before you buy it
"Incomprehensible. Also it looks ugly. It doesn't look bad, it looks ugly."
Game is far worse than demo
"Bad
Men of war better!"
people
shit keeps crashing. Cant have a single fun game without a crash in the middle. Lowkey fucks up the whole experience. 100 hous lter and its the same fucking thing. Just constant crashes.
a total waste of money!!! get ready for you gun to wobble around while trying to kill an enemy. movement sucks and the audio is god awful. just get hell let loose
donts spend your money on this guys not worth it maybe if it will go down to 1-3$
This game blow's major peiner
now worth it its hard to find a team and peaple are toxic
"absolute worst movement i have ever experienced in any online game. everything involved from aiming, to running, hell even crouching feels like im wearing a giant diaper full of baby shit. the only thing comparable to any other game is maybe the audio of gunshots... aside from that... squad isnt worth youre time or money... and i got it from cd keys for the low."
"this game was good and fun before the china update. after that. downhill.  Animations are worse. The aiming it dogshit. 
YOU CAN BE PRONE AND YOUR GUN SWAYS MORE THAN A BOAT. 
A tiny pistol sways  more than a drunk person."
"Called squad but you can't actually just queue up to join a game together, kinda comical. 

There's a lot of claims of realism but the fact is your characters vision starts to blur to near blindness if anyone is shooting near you. Yeah... this game is bad."
"Don't buy this scam, the game run horribly to the point that it's unplayable the recommended specs are nowhere near enough for this game to run at an acceptembe fps."
"Awful game.  Huge maps so you spend most of your time walking to your teammates who left you behind.  You must play in squads; no one wants to be squad leader so you get promoted to squad leader position … oop, not so fast Pilgrim … you do not have a squad leader kit and will now be kicked from the squad.  Enjoy the long walk back.  Just an all-around awful game."
"As played this game last couple of days,and see others paly this game on YouTube it look all great and seems to go the correct way to compare it to reality it's a thumb 👍 😀 I give it on the correct path. However this game in general come to players is 100% toxic to say. Don't feel welcome, be kick out if don't follow orders and can't be in a vehicle if the squad leader doesn't want you be in a vehicle by yourself. Always have to be in a squad not by yourself. Wannabe squad leaders,and players take this game way to serious 😤 this is not a joke be aware of this. This needs to be dealt with not take stuff so serious to say. Just a game. I just don't recommend this game to all to say. Stay away from this game just really toxic,until it's resolved."
"Combat overhaul makes playing a chore.
Trying to ADS is unnecessarily cumbersome with the animation doing some round about BS.
Suppressive fire is 10x worse than Battlefield 3 some how and makes combat encounters extremely one sided and impossible to return fire. to make matters worse is you'll flinch at random rounds flying from across the map lmao."
Squad community ban list and badmins ruin the game
"I understand there is a 2 hour policy but this game is so technical AND SLOW that you would need to spend at least 2 hours deciding if it was even any fun.
1 GAME is 2 hours long!
The training can be close to 2 hours long.
Walking because you can't run for more than 100m is eating into the 2 hour time.

The reason this game is awful though is the players that have been playing it. What made me quit is I asked a question that albeit I should have learned in the training, I forgot for that moment and so I asked another squad that was requesting my help. The response was telling me to go fuck myself and redo training which I spent about 2+ hours (not including hours of YouTube videos). Then they tried to kill me.

For a game that should be about working together, you will find that IF you decide to ""work as a team,"" what that really takes on to mean is you will be doing bitch work that no one wants to do. This game is a dumpster fire waiting to explode because you either ARE a toxic player breaking simple rules or you BECOME a toxic player bullying and threatening new players until they give up.

As a 14 year EOD combat veteran, this game had so much promise to actually work as a team and trust hardworking players in a competitive milsim but in the end it's a broken game where banned-CoD players show up to piss off people who seek to escape from real life stress for a positive game because they essentially hate social interactions."
"One of the early backers here, this piece of garbage is my biggest regret among any projects I supported. It used to be a worse Project Reality, now even the their suits don't know what kind of games they want it to be. After so many years, instead of making something new like a proper PVE experience or a sandbox mode, they are selling skins and emotes, treating it like another generic twitch shooter, shilling for Chicom and became a massive sell out. Additionally, the devs have no idea what they are doing, this product has gone through multiple overhauls, at one point, they want it to be a successor to PR, but that is no longer the case not long after the game's release, then they wanted it to be a competitive shooter, so they started balancing and tweaking things in their favour, but competitive shooters soon started to fade out, and then they watched a bunch of recent war videos and decided to turn the game into a hardcore milsim with the infantry change and all, this pretty much tell you how soulless these people are, their CEO and executives don't care about your experience or enjoyment, all they want is more money into their pocket, following popular trend, turn it to another slop in the market, selling more skins and emotes, oh, and shilling for a totalitarian regime, why don't you just sign a contract with PLA and providing them your product as a training tool at this point? 

If you haven't bought this crap, just get Arma 3 if you had any money to spare, BI is a lot more based than these cucks, if not, go download Project Reality, it's free and better. This product (I wouldn't even call it a game) is nothing but a generic soulless slop and an empty shell."
"honestly the game itself is great, really enjoyable. But i feel like i need to make this review so people are aware just how toxic the community is. In my first 10 hours the amount of slurs ive heard yelled over comms makes MW2 lobbies blush, Russians everywhere are astounded by the creativity of the american mind when it comes to making up derogatory terms for minorities, I think ive been called a fa**ot more times in here than I did as a gay kid in high school which is astounding. The game is superb though and captures that realistic and tactical feeling without making guns a pain to shoot so I do recommend the game to an extent, just be wary if you dont have thick skin and are any kind of minority."
People are goofy not in a good way... combat is ass
"Very steep learning curve and less-than-forgiving community. I wish I could just go 3/5 stars, but steam only has 2 options smh"
"Very good game, unique even
But I cannot recommend it right now ( End of year 2024) because how bad the optimization has become over the years
PiP update, lightning update never addressed the optimization problems created
Performances over various setups also feels random, which is frustrating"
"Extremely toxic community. Players joke about rape, pedophilia, jews and homosexuals. I was expecting teamwork, I got the opposite and toxic talk. Unacceptable!"
"No matter what I do, I can't solve the steam offline error."
"Another milsim loserfest for fruits who prefer to sit around chit chatting and running for miles on foot (just to get sniped) rather than actually enjoying combat and shooting enemies. As with all milsim games, it could be awesome if it didnt require so much ridiculous effort to actually see some combat."
Came back after three years and infantry combat in this game has been made so much less enjoyable.
Garbage
"ok lets go, first 3 hours in game was =

Get kicked from squad for starting and then leaving and rejoining it lmao"
"Played the game fore three hours, didn't enjoy a single second of it."
dog shit
i had high hopes to much movement when shooting  aim idle sway is bad brightnest on dessert maps is bad cant see far and why cant everynoe get to change there guns to how it will help them not be limited because some one picked a gun before they could.
no
"Do not play this game if you enjoy shooting guns at other people, they made it a chore and as annoying as possible"
worst game i  ever spend money on
"have the developers ever shot or even held a live firearm?
the game was better before the update"
not for me
"Didn't cheat and was banned for no reason, guess someone was butthurt for losing in a combat. Good to know they are adding all kinds of weird stuff now."
this shit is so ass
It was a great game until they added the bots.
game is to hard just bonkers
bad many bugs
"my pc just sucks, it crashes when i try to join a match"
You can't see shit in the distance and scopes are awful.
crashes and runs like shite
My 80 year old grandmother can control this bloody gun better than these myasthenia gravis soldiers
makes you watch a dogshit 5min video everytime you launch the game
"maybe its just me but i cant seem to get any fun out of it. there`s a reason why i keep going back to sandstorm, the fun factor."
HI IM EMAN
a 5 years old kid can shoot better them solider in this game
"Player base is mostly Steam sale teenagers. New players have destroyed the game. Exceptionally toxic teenager base. They play like it's COD and vehemently oppose any real tactics or squad direction. New players are refusing to learn game mechanics as well. N bombs, homophobia, and general racism is running rampant. The game has its moments, but is overwhelmingly outweighed by the sheer volume of low skilled and deliberately toxic players. 

K/D has replaced playing the objective. I would steer away from this title. I will be exploring other options."
"Community is 50% decent and the other 50% are elitist losers who think their gazillion hours in squad mean they can talk to people like shit.

 I bought the game when it very first released on steam and periodically check in to see if anythings improved, while the devs have gone leaps and bounds above what the pre alpha was the gameplay is still tedious (if that's your thing there's no judgement) and I say this as someone who has put a lot of hours in other tactical shooters, i'm not just a cod/bf player (check my profile if you don't believe me) 

I put off writing a negative review since 2017 because I always told myself that it's just me not enjoying the game, but it clicked today that the game is just not enjoyable, the mechanics can be confusing and difficult to learn, the community is a solid 'Meh' and unless you're willing to put so many hours in that it becomes a 2nd job you will almost always be bored because the majority of the game becomes a running simulator with subpar gunplay, bad comms and confusion (and not in the immersive 'war is hell' way)

While most complaints are focused on 'shot by someone I didn't see' I don't have that problem, my issue is I see them but it takes 3 working days to aim down my optics even with full stamina and by that point somehow they either hip fire and hit me or are somehow faster (?) it's an unrealistic part of the game that was done to seem more 'realistic' I'm no expert but I've spent a large portion of my life around firearms and I can say with a lot of confidence that even the most average of soldiers can aim down their sight and take aimed shots faster than in Squad.

this brings up my final point - the game can't decide if it wants to be realistic or not. Tanks take multiple ATGMs to go down as do all the vehicles in the game, so the anti tank class is pointless simply because of the ammunition carried being heavily limited to a couple or sometimes even only a single shot. I think that example really sums up the point, infantry are heavily limited in their AT capacity for the sake of realism but vehicles are glorified rocket sponges for some obscure reason.

I would suggest if you are a fan of tactical shooters, to give it a go, maybe it's your thing, but honestly there's too much contrast between realism and arcade to me that the balance just feels wrong and hard to play."
"Literally cannot play the game half the time due to failing to connect, servers not showing and everytime I go to close the game, it crashes instead.... Every. Single. Time."
crashes to much
"Worst game ive ever played, Hands down."
As of recently you cant even get passed the loading screen the game is broke and the devs dont play it so they dont know
"Not as boring as Arma 3, but still not entertaining."
the player's are kinda suck ngl people are just rude af and dont take criticism
Game is starting to crash more frequently
"I love this game but I can't recommend it because of its extremely bad optimization, even at the lowest settings, it sometimes randomly drops to 5 fps, while running at 144+ during others.

Performance issues have been known for a very long time but the devs don't seem to care that much about it."
"runs like crap, looks like crap. retardedly unrealistic weapon mechanics. more time spend listen to inbreeds on the back of a transport swapping dad jokes. Utterly boring and a game I wish I'd got refunded."
"99% of Squad is searching for the 1% in which you'll have some of the most fun you can have on a video game. Also feels very similar to other titles on Unreal Engine (Leaning, FPS Gun Play, Driving) and not in a nice way. Biggest Issue though would be others abusing voting, such as bad maps, layers and or factions."
communist reddit-tier server admins that are unemployed ruin the experience
"-spawn
-wait 15 minutes for the game to start
-get in a logi truck with your squad
-drive for 10 minutes
-get ambushed by an enemy tank
-die
-wait 60 seconds to respawn at main base
-rinse and repeat


very fun game"
"barely even got to get into it, specs say it should run great and yet i have to sit through a like 2-3 minute long trailer EVERY TIME I OPEN THE GAME, and recently i cant even play it. I sit through one of the dumbest dev decisions of all time ( a trailer for the game you ALREADY bought and are ACTIVELY trying to play), then i sit blackscreen for 1:11:29 ( the longest i let it load ) and it still doesn't work. Great game."
Always Crashed
performance gets worse every update and its going to UE5 cant wait for it to be unplayable
"I feel like I spend more time finding servers, sitting in the queue for said server and then finding a squad that i'm not kicked from immediately (or at the beginning of the game?) for no reason so I have to join a 3 man squad with no cohesion instead, then actually playing the game."
"Put a lot of time into this walking simulator but i'm gonna be honest, until they fix performance issues, i'm not recommending this game anymore. I'm tired of convincing people to buy this 5 year old game and they can't even run it past 20-25 fps. Performance should have been at the top of the list from the beginning but they haven't done much of anything to fix it."
"shit, wtf is happening"
"bad game move 40 feet slowly and your half jerking off, say your a noob? you get kicked form the squad even if your a rifle man, somehow worse than the arma 3 community and thats saying somthing!"
cant get bipod mechanics to work literally impossible to set up in 90% of the decent spots
"This game is just a waiting simulator. You spend a few minutes waiting during the staging phase, then some idiot drives you to battle and you get blown to bits because the aforementioned idiot drove you directly into the firing line of a f ing tank. You die and wait for someone to pick you, you give up because no one picks you up... then you wait more to spawn back in again. Spawn at a hab... get blown to bits this time by artillery... rinse repeat. The amount of waiting in this game is unbearable. More than half of the 100 hours I've played so far has just been me waiting around, either because I die, or waiting for some monkey brained squad leader to make a decision of where we should attack... then you waste more time driving or sprinting to wherever they want their squad to go. Then finally get where your pea brained squad leader wants to go... and now sit here and hold left click to build a bunch of sh** for 15 minutes.

The game is horribly unoptimized which is hard to believe if you consider the game's age... but yep barely able to break 60 fps and constant dips to 40 and below. Even people with higher end machines complain about performance issues.

I will admit the game can be fun at times... but most of the time you will be standing around doing f**k all. For so long at times where I can literally get up and leave for a couple minutes and nothing has happened in that time.

And when you die in this game it's usually from some guy who's miles away and you couldn't even see. Which makes it even more frustrating when you die when you factor in the absurd wait times in between action. Occasionally your team will setup a forward hab, close to the front lines and this will get you back into the action faster.

Overall, it's not a terrible game... but it's not for everyone. Not to mention all the f ing racist morons that infest this game like a plague."
Would not recommend even with an updated Graphics card I'm still getting crappy frames and everytime I aim out of a scope it freezes my game.
dawg idek
How do I lonch a game
"Admins can ban for whatever they want, once you get banned from 2 servers your copy of the game is bricked and you cant play on any servers,


Also no VOIP enemy chat on the offficial vanilla servers which sucks"
fun but 99% of the time youll be running. wild people enjoy this for hours... i get maybe 1-2 games an dive had enough of running and not seeing anyone. call it skill issue. its not fun
meh boring and bad
"Most games no one places spawns and you spend most of the game either waiting for a spawn or running from main. The community is extremely toxic and it drains what ever enjoyment can be found out of the game. The private servers are owned by clans most of which like to stack their team and just slaughter a team of random blue berries who have never played together, I guess its fun for them but for everyone else it feels like a waste of money for a shitty experience. I can see how it would be fun if people worked together and communicated but most of the time that isn't going on either. The experience overall is really hit or miss and most often its a miss."
"After a very conflicting inner debate, I decided to ""Not Recommend"" this game to anyone who is looking to get into team-based military tactical shooter.
This is not to say Squad is a badly made game, but on the contrary, the gunplay, vehicle and tactical designs are very realistic and immersive. However the killer here is the ""community server based PvP"" gameplay.
Populated servers are always full and you'd have to wait through a queue, usually over 2 min. After that, you are often greeted with a page of server house rules and an arrogant and rude squad leader. 1st time or newbie players are treated as literally ""cannon fodders"" in the game because anyone that prevents the sweaty ""hardcore veterans"" from winning is an expendable. Hell, even the some Medics would blame you for dying, in a PvP game!? 
Forget about learning tactical movements and strategies, the winning side is usually the one mounting more cheesy spots and using more cheesy exploits of the game mechanics (search those 1man vs tanks Squad video on YouTube and you'll see), because it is a PvP based game. All the COD and BF players would not like it cuz ""aiming'n gunning"" would get you killed more and constant action isn't the core of the game. On the other hand, new players seeking ""tactical elements"" would also be disappointed cuz nothing guides you into the chaotic and toxic PvP environment.
If the game has a full single-player campaign or a PvE mode that actually helps recruits learn the basic tactics, like it is advertised, then it's a easy ""Recommeded"" review. But until then, I can't suggest it to others seeking to get into this genre, unless you can put up with a rude and toxic group mic and is okay being ordered to stare at a doorway and forget about the whole game."
"The game is so unoptimised and nobody is welcoming in this, You join a game to hear absolute silence from your team and most of the time get kicked out from a squad or squadmates leave to force you as squad leader. If your joining a game that specifically says to communicate then be prepared to talk otherwise it spoils it for everyone."
8.2 Didn't make ICO any better. Even at High Graphics at 1440p looking through scopes everything is pixelated. The Hardcore/Tactical Shooter Genre will never get a game that is cutting edge and will scratch that itch or have developers who are competent.
devs nerfed the gunplay to the point its not very fun.
"Bad gunplay (Vomit inducing kinda bad)
No destructible environment 
Stupid revive mechanic witch makes killing enemies kinda pointless
Only playable if u have people to play with
Bad performance for how the game looks

Has potential to be a good tactical shooter but needs tons of work"
never let your gay friend suggest a game!
it made me reget the game
"This game is trash, it states you can use controller but what they don't say its a combo keyboard and controller I am all good, it freezes on me and I have a Ryzen 9! max RAM! crazy video card! this game is not what they say"
"With the recent changes to combat, the firefight gameplay feels less team-oriented, and teamwork feels like its become almost irrelevant during fights. I understand the effort to address complaints about ""noodle arms,"" but I really enjoyed the game over the past few months since getting back into it. However, this recent combat update is making me want to play less."
"Makes constant updates that do nothing but break mods. And still after this many years the server browser is still hot dog shit and mnay bugs that existed since the games infancy are still around, que bugs out constantly causing you to rejoin the que at the back of the line and then when you join a server you still get stuck on the running man and guess what back to the back of the line"
HONESTLY THE ONLY THING HOLDING THIS GAME BACK IS SPAWNING
"Walking simulator/Time sink. most of your games you will see one or two enemies. most of your deaths and kills will be friendlies as the game doesnt gives indication only after youve moused over them for 5 seconds. Forget to say sorry in all chat? Banned. The game brags about being a fusion between military sim and arcade, which is laughable when its 85% military sim and 15% arcade at best. Hell let loose is a great example of that fusion, its fun and you constantly feel action, wheres squad, unless youve put in 300 hours to know how the chess game ends, youll lose every time and be killed from 300m away by someone with one of the 5 acog scopes per team. Accidently swear on a server? get immediatly banned by a power hungry 14 year old. Honestly save yourself the disappointment and play hell let loose. If i could get my money back i would, i gave it so many chances, but its honestly a waste of time."
bad game i buy it server no working
No matter how many updates these people put out for this game it's always trash compared to something like squad 44 which has way better mechanics The only downside to that game compared to this one is it's net coding I can't believe how stupid these people are when it comes to how you make squads in this game everybody fighting over something or people not doing their job because there's no dedicated roles or squads to that rule like in squad 44 what a shame and how embarrassing I've lost all hope for these people I want to refund so bad
"Was good - but the game recently had an update that made combat more direct with stamina meaning less - making it easier to land shots on targets.
I already was feeling not up to par before the update but enjoyed playing supporting roles but i'm feeling to old and slow to do anything else now.

If you were looking for a slower paced Mil-Sim FPS style game this was it, but if it continues to go this way it really isn't it anymore."
"I played the game a long time ago, before I signed the dotted line. I've since joined, served, done things I hate myself for, got out honorably, visit the VA monthly for blood work, and for the first time in a long time, I thought ""hey, I kind of miss things. Maybe I should check out that old game I played and see if I can find some guys to hang out with."" After all, being around people who don't speak the language can get pretty lonely, and I've heard vets like to play games like these for fun. How bad could it be?

Man, I didn't even get past downloading the game. I tried to join a server, got rerouted to request access through discord. Joined the discord, hopped in a vc, and was immediately told to go kick rocks for not ""following SOP."" I have absolutely no idea what the actual f**k these pre-pubescent nerd herders were talking about, since I had only just joined the discord to ""request access."" LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I cannot make this shit up. After asking what they meant by ""following SOPs,"" (keep in mind, the last time I heard the word SOP uttered from a human's mouth was when I was requesting mass for my senior officer's refusal to uphold SOPs leading to the death of a friend), I was then blasted by someone with a lisp for (and I fucking quote) ""behavior unbecoming of a wannnabe boot.""

There are phone numbers in my phone that don't work anymore. I don't sleep at night, and my kidney's are failing from adrenal fatigue. I might be one of the few people who own the game that have called out a real 9 line over encrypted satcoms before. I have not been called a boot in years. 1/10, way too realistic, definitely don't recommend. Join the military instead. They'll still treat you like scum, but at least it will be coming from someone who's actually threatening and you can get paid a little bit too. Just kidding, they won't pay you shit, but at least you'll get some action, unlike what this game has to offer. If getting treated like a recruit by a kid who lives with his parents is what you're looking for, this game is for you!"
most boring game ive ever played in my life
"FUCK THIS FUCKING GAME DUMB AS MECHS, CANT TELL APART FOR ENEMYS OR FRIENDLIES. FUCK THE FALL DMG FUCK THE SWIMMING NOT REALISTICK! FUCK THAT FUCKING GAME"
"I really enjoy the concept of milsim which is why I bought this game. Tried hopping into multiple squads. None of the squad leaders were giving instructions on what to do, everyone was doing their own thing separately. I got really annoyed blindly running and getting shot randomly, having no medics nearby to revive me and so refunded the game. Your teammates make or break the game and I was unlucky enough to be in squads with non-cooperative members."
"I was really looking forward to play Squad , but unfortunately my experience was overwhelmingly disappointing.
Here are the key issues of this game which made it frustrating:-
1.Complex And Cluttered HUD: Compared to clean and simplified intuitive interface of Project Reality , Squad's HUD Feels Cluttered and hard to navigate 
2.Toxic Admins and Larpers who think they are some captain or lieutenant: Unfortunately i Rammed into these people most of my time during my squad experience .
3.Lack Of singleplayer and COOP: The absence of singleplayer severely limits the game replay value without any hassle of toxic players 
4.Unrealistic Recoil and Gun Sway:The Recoil pattern and weapon handling looks absurd in this game compared to real life . How TF a lightweight 5.56 M4 feels clanky and heavy in This so called realistic game
5.FPS And Post Processing Issues: I experienced frequent fps drops and post processing issues that further detracted my overall experience

Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed with my experience with Squad . While i appreciate that Offworld tried to make it more realistic by implementing Infantry Combat Overhaul but somehow it made it much worse and it made Squad much more deviated from actual combat and realism."
"The gun play is horrible gun play. Ads feels like im in a rolling barrel. I dont know, I havent played it too much. But im beginning to think this was a waste of money, but we'll see in the future"
Ive seen more realistic tactics used in gmod servers
"Came from Hell Let Loose expecting similar experience. I did not enjoy this game at all. You have to learn what the enemy looks like as there are no immediate indicators of who is friendly and who isn't. You end up TK'ing a lot in the beginning making it a bad first experience. Devs should let new players have better friend and foe visibility, then slowly take that ability away as you gain experience. Sure you lose realism and maybe I could get gud. Nah, I'll just go back to HLL and have a better gameplay experience. The movement is just so clunky, I thought HLL was a running simulator. This game is a walking simulator. Not fun. Sorry."
Great game but servers are a mess. Hard to find games with low latency. Non-DLC game weapons and skins are pretty trash.
"Squad is a labor of love.

What I mean by that, is that no other game that I am aware of comes even close to the level of play-ability, practicality, and unique game play that can be experienced on this game. I have had moments with friends that exceeded excitement beyond any FPS i have ever played, or action/military movie I have ever watched. There is a role, and way to play for everyone out there in this game.

Squads largest folly, and reason you must know before buying is the community. Squad has harbored some wonderful individuals and my friends list has grown because of it. However, in that same vein, i have met some truly abhorrent individuals on this game. Due to the way OWI handles ""Dedicated Servers"", the community has the reigns on the network. This results in a small group of people, including clans, dictate the way the game is played. Some of the best servers available with the lowest ping, are held privately by discord groups and clans. Unfortunately because of this, favoritism, rule abuse, admin abuse, and overall quality of life suffers. Without TRUE Neutral ""Dedicated Servers"" you will always be looking over your shoulder if you make a wrong move, reading endless rule boards on joining a new server, etc. and the community unfortunately has simply accepted that as standard.

Ultimately, even if you aren't an asshat, you will unfortunately run into an abusive admin, it is almost guaranteed at this point in time. Until true dedicated servers that are independent from community control are available on this platform i cant recommend purchasing this game. But if you are looking for a memorable experience, one i have yet to even come close to matching in any other game available in the lords year 2024, get this game now."
"I may give it another go when there aren't so many new players from the sale.
But even the regulars of the community are much more socially maladjusted than Squad44 (which is actually fun).

This is a game for a specific type of person and I am not that kind of person."
Not Fun
game is only fun when you have 30+ people working together. every other time its miserable.
what the diddy
for some reason squad server don't show up and there is no fix for it. tried everything and still couldn't fix it. online game with a non functioning server list system. don't bother and refund if servers are not showing up after trying the fixes. Offworld doesn't want you to play the game.
AFTER AN UPDATE OF 1KB YOU NEED TO PATCH WHOLE FUCKING GAME
ASS
anti-fun
a
"Its a fun game in theory. The community is fairly immature and racist.

Communications are hard to comprehend how to format and only leads to people raging at you if you can't understand the vague guidelines offered.

EDIT:
EXAMPLE::
- ""Hey guys turn up your local chat volume so you can hear the people around you.""

- *turns up volume.*

- *music blasted into my ears such that I am deaf.*

Ya'll wonder why new players don't have a good time in this game??"
"bad gameplay, dying player base"
admin go on power trips
Game just dosent load anymore
"I wanted to like this game, my friends play it and like it........ But i spent 90 minutes in the game and experienced a bug where i couldnt Aim down the sights so i was useless for 15 of those minutes and then Dying didnt even fix it. AND Twice when i re-spawned i was stuck inside a F-ING WALL! My friends said this has never happend to them but TWICE IN MY FIRST 90 MINUTES?!? How is this game Very Positive? Seems completely bug ridden to me."
walking simulator
fuck your damn unskipable intro. dumb as hell. why do  i need an intro video for a game i have hundreds pf hours in
"played the game for YEARS loved it, can't get into game without skipping the uh... video newb intro? ESC doesn't work anymore uninstalled for now"
"not a bad game at all, crashes all the time though"
"TOO MANY PEOPLE MAKING UP RULES AS THEY GO AND RUINING PLAYER EXPERIENCES, PLAY ARMA 3 AND DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. ADMINS ACT LIKE THEY ARE GODS. SUPPORT OPTIONS DONT EVEN RESPOND. PLAYERS USE KICK TOOLS IN ABUSIVE MANOR MAKES GAME UNPLAYABLE."
Would be a good game if it had some kind of single player/campaign/solo mode for people that work for a living and don't want to be subjected to sweaty neckbeard try-hard manbabies on power trips.
"Tentando conseguir um reembolso, mas é difícil pq cada partida leva em média 1:30h e a Steam dificulta o após 2h de uso.

No mais, o jogo não possui servidores suficientes. É quase impossível encontrar um servidor brasileiro com menos de 15 jogadores na fila. Além disso, o jogo é genérico e mal explicado., e não inova em nenhum sentido. Sinceramente, acredito que o Arma 3 possa ser melhor."
game is great. the new aim system made it bad though. its not realistic and its not gamelike
"It's a fantastic game but gets a dislike due to a lack of Linux proton compatibility support - if Cyberpunk2077 and Warthunder have Linux support, why cant squad?"
"I cant say anything about the gamplay of this game, but i am very upset with the fact i cannot even get past the ""agree with our policy"" screen because the screen is way to zoomed in to click ""agree."""
"fix the audio of burning vehicles, its making me go deaf as admin while moving in admin cam ! 
the effects are at 0% and still i hear it"
low fps lol lol
"The combat overhaul RUINED the game. The game was 1000 times more enjoyable and satisfying before the update. Now it just feels like a chore and a pain in the ass to deal with the horrible mechanics, it's virtually unplayable. Not to mention the worsening performance, I don't remember it ever being as bad as it is now. 

It was good while it lasted though."
"(recreated review)

game is still somewhat bad"
"RECENTLY IN GAME I SAW LOT OF TOXIC PEOPLE. TRASH TALKING, TROLLING, TEAM KILLING OVER AND OVER, I CHANGED LOT OF SERVERS BUT LOT OF PLAYERS ARE THE SAME, I'M NOT WITH THIS COMMUNITY ANYMORE."
"Started really nicely few years ago.... but over time, performance went to shit more and more... any now they are planning to upgrade to UE5 (meaning that performance will go to shit even more)... bear in mind that this is now a ""Live Service"" or ""Free to Play"" game which gets upgraded over time.. All they had to do is finish the game with features, optimise it and leave it as it is... and then create a upgraded sequel... this way, you might buy the game now and in a year or two your hardware won't be able to support it anymore because of the ""upgrades""......"
"What was originally a unique and fun game. 

Has been trashed by poor management choices and piledrived into a un optimised shamble.

Forget whatever hardware youre packing, The game simply will run like garbage while the developers are deaf to the community and think shiny = good.

Do not waste your money. Theyre switching to UE5 and are absolutely going to kill this game with blind ignorance. 

Spend your time elsewhere."
"came back after a year, game runs way worse.
shit game."
They ruined infantry with new mechanics and there are many times where you're bullets are hitting off sand bags or debris that are no where near you're gun which end up getting you killed. game turned into running simulator and people intentionally throw matches and there is no punishment and it just wastes the time for everyone else in the match.
stuck on black screen
Game has become insanely toxic. Especially if you use vehicles. Not worth the buy if you're a chill gamer looking to have fun.
i dislike
Game was too realistic: when I got in the commander seat of the tank I was totally useless and did nothing but block the door out of the coffin in my final moments
This game looks like fun. I hope to try it out one day.
fix the mlr bug you cant change seats
"Great game if you like the genre.
Sound compartment is amazing. Graphically good and good is the game play. 
Unfortunately the community is increasingly getting less welcoming and more toxic, insulting other players for no good reasons. Also is missing a proper, useful and quick tool to report abuse or misconduct."
"Do you like scenic vistas? Do you like bumpy Humvee rides? Do you like controlling your rifle with 2 poolsticks attached to jello cubes? Then dang this is your game? 

Do you want a war game that relies on teamwork, strategy, has fun gameplay, ballistics and vehicles? Go play battlefield. Fuck this game over and over and over again."
this game bad!!! very bad!!!!! do not play pls!!!!!!1!!!!!!1!!
Crashes constatnly
"This game is utter trash, no cohesion, running simulator, spawn and die by enemies you can't EVER see. Frustrating as hell. Rather stick to HLL where it is actually fun and not a damn ever lasting uphill battle where you rarely shoot your weapon, and if you do it's mostly blind fire, where you end up getting shot by an unseen enemy from a mile away. Total utter effin' trash."
"I highly recommend this game to people who are reaaaally committed to mil-sim stuff. As in, you wanna join a group\clan, organize time to play together, and coordinate in large groups. Anything less than full cooperation and teamwork, and this game is a nightmare. 
I, too, once naively thought I'd be able to join an unlocked squad in a public server and run around, fight, do my thing. But that's wrong; you're going to play squad leader now, the last twelve disconnected because playing SL sucks major donkey balls. ""Why does it suck major donkey balls?"", you might ask. Well. Squad leaders don't fight, they talk. They don't get rocket launchers, or sniper rifles, or LMG's, or cool gadgets like IED's. Instead they get a special squad leader-only radio channel so they can talk even more. Instead of putting your mind to the tense and competitive issue of pointing your gun at someone who's pointing their gun at you, you'll get to deal with issues like ""where should I place this rally point"", ""where is my squadmate I need to place this rally point"", ""Nobody is communicating"", ""I can't hear, there are six people talking at once"", ""I've got to get the logistics truck someone else abandoned"", ""Ah shit the logistics truck is stuck"", etc etc.
If you're looking for something in this vein, but easier to play solo or with a few homies, I'd recommend Hell Let Loose. It has a lot of similarities, but in my experience it's way less of a pain in the ass."
"Shittest game ive ever played, i mean that"
"huge waste.. the servers are laggy and the game is dead, its a friday afternoon and there are 20 people online, not even enough for an actual match to start. I sadly am uninstalling the game :/ i hoped it would be good but its just so dead and laggy even killing bots isn't fun"
waste of time
"Aiming in the game became a total joke. I'm not expecting to run around like Rambo, but if I have full stamina, a red dot and a guy sat 90 feet laying prone spraying wildly, i shouldn't have my aim shaking like a shitting dog because he managed to get a stray bullet in my postcode. The game has gone through many meta's but now it is literally the scene from Naked Gun 2 rooftop shootout, with some bum rush tactics thrown in."
game is poorly optimized to the point it stutters at the slightest turn of the mouse im on a i7 10th gen with a 2070 running at medium wit 1080p settings and it still stutters this is embarrassing
"great ass game
standing by

9/27/23- game is trash, ruined by the people at owi. you can tell that they have never played the game or never shot a gun. do not buy this game. owi has shown time and time again that they are incapable of releasing a solid update without breaking the game and adding more bugs that will never be fixed. they have shown that they do not care about fixing long time bugs. they have shown that they do not care or listen to the long time players that have 2,3,4 even 7k hours. they only care for money. DO NOT GIVE IT TO THEM.


10/09 first ico patch- game is still boring, i cannot play this game. i do not understand how to play the game now. moving means you cannot shoot, get shot at means you cannot shoot back. its not a fun game no more. changed to let new players have fun. classic squads was a punishing tactical game. the patch aint patch enough. the slow player movement is okay, but the abd gun play with the new suppression and stamina is not okay. it sucks ass. still do not give otw and tencent your money.

10/24/23- this is prolly the last review i will do for a while. After a month of playing the ico, it still sucks. I haven't played a full match of squad in over a week due to lackluster gun fighting, and not being able to kill ♥♥♥♥ due to the trash gunplay. old squad was punishing and tactics was key. The ico main goal was to up the ttk and thats what they have done. No longer are the days of wiping a full logi that turned down the wrong street. This is just my opinion but if you have not bought the game and is currently reading this review, just know and understand I used to love squads and it was the only game i still looked forwards to playing. Now, i think about the state of the game and feel heartbroken. ♥♥♥♥ you owi and and offworld devs. go SAD. call me bad, call me whatever you want. hope this helps and i hope some dev reads this.

If you are looking at my recent hours, understand ALL of the hours I have since 09/27/23 are on the MEE mod which is a mod that slows the game down in various ways without ruining INF game play while also keeping v6 gun mechs.

5/10/24- game is still trash, ico seen little to no tweaks, bug patches are for from being a regular thing and the dev team, dont get me started, from banning players on discord with bad reviews to breaking steams TOS, they are god awful. Only thing to look forward to are mods. Lmao, till next time, this is how my worthless steam review on a game I use to love will sit. ♥♥♥ u OwI jHeTt."
10% of the time it's one of the the most exciting and immersive FPS games around. 90% of the time it's a coin flip on being either an absolute snore fest or you're getting your fudge packed to no end.
wont let me open after 100 hours of play time
"Before the infantry combat update, you played as a trained soldier, cool, smooth and fast. You could aim and hit your targets, a few bullets flying overhead was no biggie and you did your PT in training so you could run 20 feet and still shoot accurately. 

Now after the ICO everyone has noodle arms, your vision is blurred terribly upon taking even just a couple rounds from small arms fly overhead and sprinting for even just a couple seconds drastically reduces your aiming abilities. This went from a semi realistic mil sim shooter to what the nerd game devs think a real firefight must be like. Having shot real guns, and had real training through swat the ICO did not all deliver the realistic infantry mechanics you come to a game like this for."
"the game is fun and enjoyable but after a recent update, even on the highest possible graphics, there are AA artifacts and some maps have random white objects. im sorry but I can't recommend a game, as much as fun it is, if it doesn't run on my system. And for those wondering I have a 5800X3D 7900XTX, it's not my specs. 

if the devs ever fix this graphics issue, this game will be very fun to play"
Players so toxic
Can't see anything
"Boring, just like arma Sim mod Server, some people (mostly the ones with no jobs) are shouting at you, screaming and flaming the toxic crap out of you for just playing the game. (I wonder why I dont want to communicate with such individuals) when solo mod against bots?"
"if i have to be dead honest the games whole entire gameplay is stale. it's literally an endless walking simulator until you get shot out of completely fucking out of nowhere by a tank shell or a sniper who does it for a living. its boring, rather recommend insurgency sandstorm for a better tactical gameplay (being for real dont even think about buying this game)

EDIT: its also an unoptimized piece of shit game. today i went to a hardware store to replace my ryzen 5 2600 with a ryzen 5 5600x and it made about 10-15 fps diff. game is literally made by lazy developers"
jhklkj
"ICO made infantry combat extremely boring and doesn't improve teamwork in any shape, way, or form. Couldn't recommend"
"Recently Re-installed Squad, its a Fun game, when it works. Currently plagued with a EAC error that seems to have no fix and with many others having the same issue over the last week and no fix yet. Really makes you think the devs are far more worried about emotes and gun skins rather than a functioning game. Garbage, and i wish i could get my money back at this point."
.
i open the game and watch the start of the game then it wont load any menus
hi pls optimize
why the FUCK does it take so long to load into a basic match and actually fuckin' PLAY?
"This game, hands down, has the worst shooting mechanics of any FPS game I've ever played. I don't know why the devs think that ""Realism"" means that you cant even hold your weapon even partially steady, or that you cant run more than 20 feet without getting winded as a trained soldier. The game  used to be fun until they changed the infantry game play, and the overall game play besides the shooting mechanics is awesome, but now it's so incredibly frustrating to play that it's not even worth the hassle. Do not recommend."
"step 1-install game
step 2-open game
step 3-join server
step 4-they want you to install mods
step 5-spawned in
step 6-didn't know anything around me
step 7-exit game
step 8-uninstall game
step 9-kms with a pistol"
I have a 1660s and 5600g 32gb ram. I exceed the requirements but im only getting around 40 to 50 fps
"Community is toxic and full of very stupid people for admins. Couple of short examples:
1. Play vehicle, friend crashes, driving vehicle back to main solo. Admin tells me to leave the vehicle or get kicked, I comply. Friend rejoins, we head back to the vehicle. I get kicked for leaving the vehicle in the middle of nowhere as told. :D
2. Our tank is hit, I jump out to repair tracks, admin tells my friend to ""stop soloing vehicle or get kicked"" he jumps out.. We both get killed while outside. Soon, as the SL I get kicked for ""wasting assets"". :D
F This game. F those people."
"Poorly optimized, meh UI, weapon handling & Graphics is pretty dated (That 2005 idea of what realism is supposed to be). At the price point id expect something MUCH better. At best this is a 14.99 game."
do not play it
GAME BAD IT CRASHT 2 TIMES IN ROLE DO NOT GET THE GAME
not my thing
"I still cant log in to any server cause the error of steam not connected 
and i cant play the game"
terrible game. was great till ICO. ruined it. :( play project reality!
"If you thought this game was in any way realistic or tactical it's not. It's an arcade where you pick a pre-built load out from a UI menu that's a pain in the ass to navigate, no customization or even a variety in choice whatsoever. Walking simulator because there's no free access to vehicles, all vehicles are private to each individual squad so you physically can't join with any friendlies and jump into battle, or escape from battle by retreating to a friendly vehicle. Also can't join any squads because all squads are locked in at just one or two people, while the five squads that are actually open to the public are always full. And you're not allowed to make your own squad if there's unfilled squads, ie. the squads that can't be joined because they're locked in at just one person. Then because you're not joining any squads (because you're not allowed to) you get kicked from the game. The name of the game is SQUAD and no one wants to SQUAD and then YOU get KICKED for not SQUADING... FUN, RIGHT?!

So what happens if you actually do snatch a free seat in a rarely open squad and actually get into the fight for once and finally play the game? You get head-clicked by someone literally 500+ meters away who's not even within render distance, which means no one else can see them or return fire as they stand around clueless and get downed too! FUN! So then who picks you up? Nobody, no one picks up anyone or repairs vehicles or helps anyone, you just die and lose respawn tickets and then lose the match after running out of tickets, simple. Part of that is due to BUGS and GLITCHES where you CAN'T USE BANDAGES/AID KITS for some reason, but most of the time people are just selfish glory hunters getting to the top of the scoreboard for most kills to actually bother helping the team. 

In other words it's Call Of Duty without any of the freedom of choice, with servers that don't want you to squad up and play the game in the first place. If you want a fun military arcade to compete for score play COD, if you wanna play an actual military sim with realism and be a team then play Arma 3, this is just a horrible mashup between the two without any of the fun, freedom, or cooperation."
"This comment is focused on Helicopters 

I love the game i just wish the creators mentioned for heli pilots you need about 32gb of ram 16 gb is not going to do it for you i have 16gb DDR 5 Ram and my game lags extremely bad when i pilot and most of my 174,5 hours is heli pilot 

Then the other concerning topic is the amount of bugs yes the game is very good for the times its been up but really update after update after hotfix the creators refuse to fix the selection wheel when in a vehicle sometimes when i want to drop supplies oh look my game wont let me out of the selection wheel and boom crashed my heli because i cant control it or the recent update where helicopters perform better in training range then in real battle in traning range you can barrel roll any heli and do any tricks but in a real server your heli stalls out or overturns more then in the training range aswell as using guns on any heli makes the required ram from 32 gb to 128 gb it is so lagy for no reason i do love this game but unfortuantly it has to much vehicle bugs"
run for 1 hour die instantly
"very klunky game play ,very toxic community , i have encountered tons of  rude players and only one person who was willing to help a new player"
fkn shit game wont load and crash and cost 50dollars
Cant skip the intro cut scenes
"Out of all thing that pissis me off about this game is that I have to fuking deal with noodle arms

Whats with the exaggerated recoil it's annoying"
"This game opted out of family sharing, which is cringe.

Do not allow publishers to claim purchasing is not owning, sharing amongst your games like discs among family should be encouraged not dissuaded."
Once again another game that i was told to get and to play with buddies that never get on. finally decided to figure it all out on my own and got everything optimized for my pc and now the game refuses to launch ever since i restarted my pc.
totarsch
Trying to configure anything is like pulling teeth.
You still can't form a pre-game party in a game called SQUAD
.
too complicated for my little brain
Running Sim
Great concept but matches are often super unbalanced making the experience lame.
"I keep trying to come back to this game a few months at a time. I dont understand how people can enjoy this game especially since you cant join a single server ""an anti cheat integrity check failed"". I unfortunately wasted my money on this overly praised piece of trash"
"This game was fantastic until the somewhat recent combat overhaul. The weapon stability system physically makes no sense. It feels like your character has no shoulders as your weapon sways from side to side like a piece of fabric when you turn... This combined with the goofy CoD levels of recoil for EVERY caliber, especially 9mm and 5.56, which irl can be full auto mag dumped with almost zero barrel incline. Make this game feel like some sweaty nerds fever dream about what real combat looks like after he tried to shoot a heavy gun at a range once.... This game used to feel tactical and fun as hell, but now instead of feeling like a soldier I feel like some 300 lbs McDonald's going basement dweller larping as a soldier.... No one asked for that gaming experience.................................."
"EAC easy anticheat does not work or run, cannot join any servers or play because of this issue. No solution. SMH"
"""an anti cheat integrity check failed""

So fun!"
"At some point in squad you wont be able to join a server because ""Anti cheat check failed"" will appear and you wont be able to fix it since any tutorial is 100000 years old"
I love the part where I Launch the game and get a update every time I do so. Can't even play when I want to have multiple 20 gb plus updates after launching

Used to be so fun. Can't recommend it anymore, ever since they changed the gun handling."
"Spawn > walk 45 minutes across map > die > repeat

Impossible to aim or hit anything, every animation and action is sluggish and unresponsive like reloading or walking or looking, press click to shoot... doesn't shoot, press click 10 more times... it shoots, weapon sway all over screen, get booted out of a squad and given 1 magazine useless loadout and be stuck in the middle of nowhere, 2 hours and I swear I haven't seen a single enemy, get shot from behind a bush half a mile away, Weird acceleration looking and walking, pixel hunter/walking simulator."
walking simulator
"Buggy as hell. Crashing and freezing mid game, resizing on its own, inaccurate menu cursors, etc."
server problems and high latency on my region.
"ill be honest, the ICO update ruined the game. it feels like youre a 10 year old kid whos never once held a firearm when you get into combat, and oh yeah, when you run 100 yds as a SOLDIER, your stamina bar is empty and you cant shoot for shit, which mind you, as someone who does this kind of thing for a living, and has to regularly train while shooting and moving, and after running, is not how it works.  The supression mechanic in this game is also horrendous, you dont just lose the ability to see when you get shot at, if anything the adrenaline improves your vision and aim, in the game you basically become blind for 10-20 seconds, its just not accurate, and feels like someone thats never been in that scenario designed that aspect of the game. This game tries so hard to be realistic, while somehow overdoing it, all the while the performance is dogsh*t, how does a game that looks like it was made in 2015 get 65 fps on a modern pc with a 4070.  Its just trying to do too much, while simultaneously not being accurate to real life while claiming to be realistic.  They just got bought out by the chinese as well, so if you dont like that, dont buy it.  I wouldnt recommend it, and i certainly wouldnt buy it if i didnt already own it, it was so much better before the micro transactions, and ICO update. Steer clear if you actually like realistic games, play arma or HLL, this game feels extremely dated for what it is, while also missing the modern realistic aspects that are in every other modern ""sim"" shooter.  Theres like 1k consistent players, where before the ICO update there was probably 4-5k, its not bad, it just feels like theyre trying so hard to be ""realistic"" but also having no concept of actual ""realism""."
"DO NOT BUY! Devs ruined the game when they overhauled the infantry combat system... Roll back to when you could actually aim at the enemy! I've had situations where me and an enemy see each other, and can't kill each other because your gun is waving around all over the place like you're drunk af! Not even close to realistic anymore."

"Genuinely trash, save your money and just punch yourself in the face, it'll be more fun"
this game needs optimization
"The Star Wars mods are the selling point here for me. Gameplay, mechanics, customization, graphics, animations, literally everything feels at least slightly worse than the other large scale shooters and milsims. Large playerbase but not enough active servers, gotta wait 10+ minutes sometimes."
buy squad 44
"SUGA A SUA VIDA, FOQUEM NO FUTURO!"
"The game never finds a server, I can find servers while browsing outside of the game or steam (in the game it never loads any lists), unable to connect to anything no matter what I try to do, too bad I am way past the point of claiming a refund."
"Good but game is so slow
Like for every weapon draw,every time you need to get in and out of the vehicle consume so much time..Going prone and crouch also takes so much time
Game is slow,very slow
But good"
"use to be a great game now pile of hot garb, use to be everyone on same playing field. Fun exciting matches turn into i am blind, my gun is swaying everywhere, i have to lay down every 10 seconds to gather stam to line up dots... whatttttt 

took break for 10 months come back only to support as Medic but its more frustrating than anything else, Foxhole is better, Arma reforger is better
 
great game turned into a mess"
Arma reforger is better
"Game is a potential lawsuit, computers can't run this game with the recommended specs. They are just taking peoples money hope they get a lawsuit because they deserve it. Game runs poorly. Don't buy!"
crashes... a lot
"Game's good, but terrible optimization and it feels like for the past 4 years they did not do anything to fix the jarring problem."
"Boring, just boring. I like MILSIM but this game is not for me at all."
"This game is terrible when it comes to performance. My build can handle any game at 2K; for example, in BF2042 with 128 players, I get 170-200 FPS on ultra settings with DLSS Quality. However, in this game, which doesn't look that good graphically, I only get around 60-80 FPS on some maps, and on the optimized ones, I get about 100-150 FPS. Yet, it drops to 60-80 FPS in crowded areas. The experience as a war sim is fun, but the performance makes it unplayable compared to other FPS games on the market."
"bought this game played it a month enjoyed it alot but since aprils update cant even load into the menu but this last attempt i got 10 minute commercial for squad a game i already own which you cant cancel the video, than after everything It ends ands im black screen loading and don't even get a menu... what is wrong with this game you cant even load into it to attempt to give a shit."
.
ptsd acquired
Admin abuse has made this game unenjoyable.
"I have yet to be convinced that this game is actually fun. Will play a few more rounds with my friends but at this time its just been a series of listening to shouting matches and admin kicking people on the opposite (my) team for doing well.

Edit: Yeah this game fuckin sucks man why do people find this fun. I spend 3 hours running around and getting shot from places I cant see. I get it, massive skill issue, but fuck this is boring as hell."
"ICO has ruined what used to be one my favorite games, OWI has gone to shit since the original team left and are apparently staffed by people who have no concept of what squad was meant to be.

I'd refund it if I could since they've completely changed the product I paid for into something else entirely."
"Feels different, people are a lot more angry than they used to be. Not fun imo."
"I guess it's not my cup of tea. the game is supposed to be a realistic shooter, but the gunplay is to a point that it makes the game unrealistic and pretty unplayable at times. I looked into it and saw that a lot of the community feels the same. It might be a learning curve or something, but me personally, I don't think so. I think it's just bad gunplay mechanics."
turn
The gun mechanics are terrible walk for 5 seconds and then your character doesn't even know how to hold a gun anymore the second you stop walking or you jog for three seconds your character can't hold his gun straight for like 20 minutes
Read all the negative reviews on this chinese spywareUwU good gun mechanicz tho
"Any time I boot this game up I am reminded that its maps are so barren and unpopulated it's hard to fathom how anyone actually lived there, this in itself wouldnt be so bad but along with its unrealistic gunplay, game breaking bugs, and hit or miss squad leaders the game lends itself to being more frustrating than fun 80% of the time, when it does work for that 20% I often find myself asking why Im playing this vs Tarkov, Battlefield, or any other shooter that has some semblance of progression or self improvement. Oh also lets not forget they went back on their Kickstarter promises of no paid DLC, if they had made a way to earn those cosmetics as well as buy them I dont think it would be as big of an issue but the only way to get them (at the time of writing) is slapping down your hard earned dollery doos for half baked (and sometimes not functional) cosmetics that cost more than a copy of Vampire Survivors."
This is by far the worst game I ever tried.
Actions are too clunky and unresponsive.
"Weapon mechanics are too slow and clunky, recoil is horrible, ads is just weird, moving while ads is dumb. I dont understand why games get ads with weapons in game so wrong for example, using an LMG with bipod you dont bring the weapon in to aim you move your head onto the weapon. Same thing with assault rifles, when you know your about to get contact the weapon should already be in the low ready position so its just straight up and down in and out of the scope, not like in this where it shifts the weapon so far from right to left then still shaking about all over the place.

HOLY SHIT the weapon mechanics are bad in this game!"
"I love this game, but I cant recommend it to most of you. This game is based off of squad tactics and communication, each role and vehicle takes time to learn and master, and the game really shines when you have a competent team that knows their roles. Win or loss, the game is a blast when the pieces fit. However, multiple sales and free weekends later, about 80% of the players you will run across are window lickers that cant do anything but W Shift. 

The game is now plagued with SLs that dont SL, and the average blueberry is completely unreliable. Squad tactics? Nope. Communication? Whats that? Heli? I flew in Battlefield so I can take the Heli right? This is a game that demands that you use your brain, it demands that you share information and take the information shared with you to make a tactical decision for your squad and your team. And right now that just aint it. OWI recently gave us a new voting system, and the game has subsequently been destroyed because of it. Too many people dont think about their vote, they see the faction they want to roleplay as and scream to vote that faction, and then you end up with an atrocious game like British Logistics vs PLA Tank Battalion on Sanxian. (Brits have no amphibious vehicles btw, so island map is a bad pick for them lmao.)

In short, if you find yourself interested in this game, research it. And come in prepared to learn. Tell your SL you are new, if they are competent they will help you learn the game. Bind your map key to a mouse button too, you should basically live in your map. And for the love of God please use your brain. Please."
"Game is functionally unplayable.

OWI issues strict rules to server owners on what they can and can't do, but every sever is filled with loser admins who will TK for fun, but hand out bans readily for anyone they don't like. OWI lost control of the power tripping incels 'server owners'.

Until there are fundamental changes in how servers are operated, this game isn't worth your money."
"Absolute joke of a game. Servers are all run by power tripping incels. This game had so much potential but was ruined due to poor server admins. Terms of Service is a joke. Rules are only there to selectivly ban people. Server admin are a joke, WHAT A WASTE."
i once played this game everyday but now this newest infinity update completely ruined my mood to ever come back to the game but i mean some ppl like it but for me and many others is sucks that we have to put this game down and find other games
"Squad could've been amazing. This game got so close to being a true spiritual successor to Project Reality. Don't get me wrong, the game looks amazing, but the feel will never compare to Project Reality. If OWI keeps going down this trend of copy paste re-skin faction updates, the game will stray away from the original vision and get stale and boring. Waited for 6+ years to get attack helicopters and they FINALLY give us one, but only for the PMC faction, and with a very small payload. The PMC faction and the Turkish faction are almost identical for most of their vehicles. Both factions models are a majority of models that are already in the game. There is still so many great aspects of PR that Squad has yet to capture, CAS is by far one of the biggest, thermals for armor, better mod support, and the insurgency gamemode?? It's in the game but nothing like it was in PR and the lack of civilian kit makes it feel so boring. If you used to play PR and you're looking for something that can compare, Squad is not it. They almost had it right, and I like to hope that maybe they will, but recently my hope is fading faster and faster by the day."
"...na. Does not feel good to shoot in this game. no idea when you get a kill. ""realism"" sometimes just kills all the fun."
"certain roles are only available to squads of a certain size

every squad in the game is ran by a neckbeard who will kick you for not roleplaying the way they want

you cannot play most of the game because of this"
"Get rid of the new intro, shit is annoying, guys voice is annoying, wayyy too loud. Why can't I turn this shit off? Let me game in peace ffs."
"Admins ruin this game. Most anti fun cucks I have ever encountered in any multiplayer game, fuck your rules"
the new recoil/stamina system makes the game unplayable
"Trash game. Basically youre forced to play how someone else tells you to play, regardless of how you like to play..

Do you like to use a particular style weapon? Too bad. 
Do you like to do drive tanks? Too bad.
Do you like to fly drones? Too bad.

Unless some random person allows you to play YOUR game the way YOU want to, you are not allowed.. What a shitty system.

Dont buy this game"
this game is soo buggy and shit you can't even find servers and ask for help on discord no help at all just to bad unlucky
HIDE YOUR KIDS
This game was better before OWI decided every gun should feel like a 4 year old is shooting it.
"Lots of bugs, suck performance, fps drop and lagging while contact. AT LEAST 1 YEAR already. If you tell me rtx2080+9700k+32gb ram with medium high setting is not enough... man... what can I say... Maybe the devs should go back to high school to restudy 'What is Programming and Debug'."
"I've played too many fps games and the only thing good about this one is the beginning of the round when everyone is on the mics.

UI is ATROCIOUS.

Mil sim = you play dead most of the round munching on snacks; not actually playing a fps in any way.

Game is so slow that it's too late to return it by the time you play 2 games.

There is no arcade aspect to this game whatsoever.

Not worth $50 even if i enjoyed it.

Play any other fps game and enjoy your playtime."
"Every single aspect that made squad squad has been destroyed by the ICO. I was willing to try and give the new mechanics a fair shake, but the utter and incomprehensible level of incompetence by the devs is too much now to ignore. Every single step of the way since ICO they have been taking options away from players, from infantry combat to TOW function. Wanna actually guide a TOW? Nah, we're gonna make the smoke plume so huge you can't even see the trajectory for the first 500m of flight time. 

And I would be willing to forgive all of this, if it wasn't for the blatant hypocrisy at OWI. They know their ICO weapon sway is garbage, they know because the m14 is way easier to handle than every other battle rifle, but they released it with weapon sway turned down and with reduced recoil because they wanted people to like their new faction (which wasn't needed in any way) meanwhile the g3 and FAL sway/recoil like my character is an actual child. No one picks MEA, Turks, or Brits because they are objectively worse factions. OWI absolutely know this, but they are so up their own ego they can't begin to even consider the possibility they may have been wrong. The fact that it requires mods to give these factions 5.56 or similar calibre weapons is an utter disgrace to the devs. 

The ICO didn't ""change the gameplay to be more teamwork based"" it just made it worse because everyone knows most goobers who only play squad as a battlefield alternative don't care about ""working with the squad"" or ""using vehicles as mech infantry"" all they want to do is shift W to the next cap to get into another gunfight that they lose. 

OWI had the most loyal fanbase in almost all of modern PC gaming and they spat on them. They had better hope no competitor pops up in the near future, because if it does, Squad will very quickly find itself a dead game."
"According to the Community Ban List, I am listed as the 5th most toxic/harmful player in the entire game. I would like to preface what I say by just saying that any accusation that I am the 5th most toxic player in the entire game is categorically, unequivocally and resolutely untrue, for I contend strongly that I am in sooth the most toxic player in the game.

Resultingly, I request that the game, or whoever runs the Community Ban List for this game rectify their mistake and make me number 1, as opposed to 5. It is absolutely insulting that anyone could even remotely hint at me being a paltry 5th, BAH, it's a disgrace! I will make my review positive when this clerical and game changing error has been altered. Regards, Ned Kelly."
unoptimised piece of shit
"Would be a brilliant game, but the community are so toxic. Each server I played on had rampant racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. In a game that requires you to have a mic and listen to the other players, this made the game unplayable."
"No sex update, bad game"
Servers not loading
intro should be loud and unskippable
TRASH GAME STUCK ON CINEMATIC
"FROM YOUR AD BULLSHIT, WE ALREADY BOUGHT THE GAME WE DONT NEED SEE DAM AD FOR IT IN THE GAME"
WALKING/YAPPER sim w poorly optimized PiP features and really bad shooting mechanics. Optimization has gone steadily downhill for a few years. Armor is fun if you can get it but sometimes your tank will be unable to drive up a hill.
"walking simulator, need small maps"
No achievements
"Squad used to be my all time favorite game to play. Every day I would come home and play at least two hours of Squad. It had everything. Large maps, 120+ player lobbies, helicopters and tanks, getting in firefights with enemies on a mountain top a kilometer away. I was instantly hooked and loved every second. Then around my 680 hour mark, ICO was released and completely ruined the game play experience for me. Before ICO, you were able to quickly return fire when fired upon at close range and be able to hit your target as long as your reticle or iron sights were on their body. With ICO there is now a ""suppression"" mechanic that blurs your screen when shot at as well as making your arms very shaky, making it extremely difficult to aim. ICO has made it so that whoever shoots first wins almost every time. It's very unfortunate because this game really used to be great. RIP True Squad"
yeah no this game sucks lmao
"It would be cool to be able to play the game you know without constant freezing.

Needing to do a NAT hairpin/loopback to be able to join a server running on the same machine is stoopid
"this game is just bad, 6 hours later it is still bad.

My buddy tyler HATES it too"
what did they do to this game
unoptimized mess
ICO ruined this game
"Absolutely garbage game the worst optimization ive ever seen i have a 4080 super and a ryzen 9 7950x and i barely get 110fps.
I've had the game since 2018 its just progressively gotten worse!!
They also slowed down the game sooo much theres nothing positive about it i used to look past the horrible performance but now its an all around 1/10 game."
"eat early access dogshit for $50

the game is literal dogshit when it comes to gameplay, can't use your laser or a flashlight even if you have one, lags very badly with only 40 max even with my 3080, poor made scope modification system, missing lots of animation like entering a vehicle or switching seats despite this game claiming to be so immersive, this game has nothing special than just graphics and lighting.
imagine all of your ammo disappears at the middle of the battle because some guy kicked you from your squad"
"Ever since the overhaul the game has been shit. Players are all spineless when it comes to teaching the game to new players and the community has been ruined. Unless they revert the game back to the way it was, I will never touch this game again."
fix noodle arms
"Played this game for the first time in like 2 years and WTF. The movement is so slow and clunky now, feels like im on the surface of the moon. If you remember a time when the game felt responsive and had an intuitive UI, just know those days are long long gone. Dont waste your time."
"Game has become a 2 min advertisement for itself followed by a blank screen. Windows volume mixer cannot silence it. Only master volume can turn it off. 0/10 stars, chinese bloatware.

If and when it ever works it's a pretty unique game."
"TRIED ARMA? Thought squad would be a little easier? Think again, it is a running/dying simulator."
"This game is a piece of shit fcking parkinsons simulator delayed microphone like im in 90s sitcom up in this bitch just because the game is a milsim doesn't make it good, my microphone on 3 headsets doesn't work, ohhh and thanks for the microtrasactions.
You had it YOU FCKIN HAD IT IN THE BAG but noooooooo let's ruin this like with squad 44 imma go back to project reality and operation flashpoint choke on a dick"
"Shooting feels like you have wet noodles for arms, my grandma can hold steadier aim"
"join games where nobody speaks english because if not you have to wait 20 minutes or more for a basic server. Then nobody tells you about the horrible infantry update where you hold the weapons like a toddler, toxic community of team killing, random admin kicking, the horrible communication, then walking for 15 minutes and then getting one tapped by some random dude in a bush or 200m away that has been staring in the same spot for 1 hour. I even bought a nicer headset to enjoy the communication, waste of money, waste of time. Just as bad as tarkov."
"The old squad was a blast, this new version is utter trash if you play infantry.

The gunplay is abysmal. It's as if both of your arms are broken initially for 10 seconds after you ADS. Yet if you wait long enough you can shoot as accurate as a benchrest shooter but you are actually standing firing offhand. It boggles the mind how bad this system is. In short if you move you die, if you just sit around you can snipe people like it's nothing. Oh and almost every type of damage you receive causes fatal bleeding unless you bandage yourself. So your whole body is one big artery. And don't get me started on the clunky animations. I've seen better and faster weapon handling from first time shooters than the soldiers you play as. There's no animation blending whatsoever."
you go in to ply and everything is blurry as shit a person two meaters in front of you is a blob and anyone across road is just a blurr
how are you going to have a mill sim game and kick people for saying shit in chat are you 12 bunch of pussies running the servers
"The game is not good for three main reasons
1. Bad community
There is lot of noobs and call of duty headless chicken players that just play the game for the dopamine of getting kills, the game is not as tactical and cooperative as the trailer shows.
2. Bad administration
The moderators will ban you for stupid reasons, the rules of their servers are ambiguous and they ban people FOREVER for the most stupid reasons. While they dont ban players that dont comunicate or waste tickets.
3. Bad mechanics
This is the least important point, the game is programmed well, and the mechanics are not really very bad. But it just dont seem to encourage/force people enough into cooperating and playing using their head instead of as stated earlier searching the dopamine of killing.

Honestly, dont buy this game, is not worth it."
"A menu within a menu within a window, within poorly constructed menus and controls. It's perhaps not as bad as ARMA, but the few hours I did play 99% of the time, I was lost in settings and bugs.

Bugs (shorter list) - I had issues using a controller; it says ""mostly playable"" on the store page but in reality it has absolutely zero controller support neither on foot or in menus. Another bug I had was trying to get the game to accept sending audio to my headset - resulting me in to having to close and reopen the game a few times.

Settings - the UI with interacting with things, general control settings seem very wonky and convoluted.

Controls - Almost as bad as ARMA. For some reason they decided to turn something as simple as entering a vehicle into a 3-step process where you can enter after holding interaction down for 5 seconds, or tinker with supplies on something like a truck, to auto entering the driver seat while tinkering with supplies. Then when you are in the truck - you have to hit a separate magical button to start the engine (I couldn't get it to work on the keyboard, but I could start an engine via a controller layout I found). For a lot of the time, I would use a controller layout until I had to use keyboard, and when using keyboard and something very stupidly simple like ""crouch"" or starting an engine - I had to go back to the controller because it was simpler.

I cannot understand why you can't just go to prone (Z), to standing upright. In the tutorial even, I could go from prone to crouch just fine but standing was .... like finding a gold brick in your behind, under a foot, while hand standing on a chair. If you are in prone and jump - it'll let you stand but you'll also go from prone to literally a hop in the air before you were standing.

Other than these issues... The game ran good, the walking and running motions were amazing. The firing of any weapon were amongst the best in FPS gaming. Even throwing objects like grenades were feeling really good. The slow and deliberate aiming of the weapons and other gun-play were superb. It could really be a game changer if they simply worked on the controls and UI to a more friendly level."
"fucking piece of shit walking simulator why would you play this shit ass game in your free time shit takes 30 minutes of walking to get into some action and if you sue a car you just blow up instantly once u get there absolute fucking bullshit game teammates keep killing me bruh fucking shit game. 30 year old towering pile of fat father figure calls an airstrike on our team and then yells at us for ""wasting"" 5 tickets even though we have a fucking 1000 left. When im popping off and killing everyone they kick me from the server for ""racism"" and toxicity or some bullshit absolutely fucking unacceptable"
"ICO is fucking stupid, average combat experience is being a trained soldier running 10 meters then shaking like an alzheimer's patient when you try to ADS"
Not enough shooting of minorities/
please revert ico update
"Just die and die and die, get shot from every direction and can't ever see who's shooting you or tell which side anyone is on.  This game sucks."
L game
"Was looking for a serious tactical shooter and then you add people, then tactics are gone out the window."
"You need to fix ICO scope issue, when u ADS game looks like minecraft, FPS drops, especially when there is heavy combat. U implemented ICO and with that u just worsen the game experience cuz now FPS is big problem, u need to fix first these technical problems before implementing some new stuff to the game. If i need NASA pc to play this game at 60fps 1080p then its a problem at ur end. Even Tarkov dont lag like this game. I like this game but its unplayable because of FPS drops, ADS minecraft scopes, and I think u should consider reworking gun sounds, but first PLEASE fix FPS drops, then PLEASE fix these scopes. Thanks"
"I have enjoyed this game for a long time. 

Once the new shooting mechanics (ICO) came in I had to leave, it was such a massive change I couldn’t accept it. 

I went away with the idea of coming back in a few months to a year and hopefully the system would have matured and balanced. By this time I would have forgot my muscle memory of how the game handled as well. 

I have played a few games in the last few days and I can whole hardily say the  game is dead to me now. 

Every aspect of this game is a 10/10 except the shooting. THIS IS NOT HOW SHOOTING AND FIGHTING WITH A GUN FEELS!!!. 

The shooting system reminds me of an old Xbox game called “Full Spectrum Warrior” where you required to suppress a position and use flanking, but even with a flank when you guys engaged you entered some sort of hit percentage probability. Great for that game and what it was trying to create but it does not work for a modern day, semi mil sim game like this. 

I have zero understanding on the player bases acceptance of this mechanic and why it hasn’t died. 

Here is to the future of tactical shooters and hopefully something comes that fills the hole left by this games changes.

8.2 points: Better gun play but still a good way to go. Binoculars should have a stability issue, nor should anti tank weapons. Pistols needs further improved along with iron sighted/red dot equipped rifles. My review is still accurate."
it is getting boring very quiqly
"Indeed this game requires microphone to play it BUT before that, basic motor skills, least amount of intellect and knowing moderate level russian is verry crucial for this game, if you don't have at least one of them don't play it. 0-1 ticket loosing/10 israil and hamas as factions and concert venue + gaza hospital as maps would be awesome ( of course with civilians and childs )"
it bad
downloaded the game and cant play it because its stuck on some black screen. worst money ive spent all week dont recommend
"This game used to be amazing with so many fun moments. Since OWI's last marketing push, the health of the community has suffered greatly. Servers are now filled with those who do not even want to begin to try to coordinate with others. Many I suspect do not even have a working microphone. It's being played more like battlefield at this point. There has always been a learning curve with experienced players teaching the new. With this last batch of players, it's not teaching, it's like trying to drive a bus full of special education students who missed their medications this morning. OWI has found their target demographic, and I hope they enjoy it. I just wish somebody would have explained to them that quantity doesn't equal quality."
"I've never done a steam review, but this got me so angry i had to do one and let people know.

squad can be an enjoyable game, playing with teammates and having communications has been quite a different experience from traditional shooter games. despite having 80 hours total i still felt like a new player and still trying to figure out how things work clearly.
its sometimes hard to hear people speak and telling friend from foe is difficult in situations despite with 80 hours in.

but despite the gameplay, do not play this game, because eventually the people in charge won't let you play anymore. despite spending 50$ you'll feel scammed and mistreated, if you try to have fun you'll be unable to play the game. and this game will slowly run out of players.

the real problem lies on its community, there's a bunch of reasons why that is, and why you shouldn't purchase this game.

1) the servers, how servers work is that they're run by the community, specifically clans, the admins throw random bans over the most minimum mistakes, there's a lot of admin abuse, they have ""strict"" rules and you cannot question them, if you do, you get banned, but the rules don't apply to clan members, admins, or patreon users, the mods go on ego trips and ban you over the pettiest things, you will find out that you're being secretly recorded by users, are they doing it for youtube? streaming? no they're doing it to get you banned, what they do is record something, and upload it to their discord to get you banned.
in other words, it's a solid way to ban new players over the pettiest things, you can try to appeal it but either you have to lick their boots to soothe their ego, or an admin will say ""we'll look into it"" and have the ban stay.
this happens in all servers, and it happens to all players. you won't be able to play on servers for months, even permanently, even if you follow all the rules, and do everything as you say, it won't matter because you'll be at fault no matter what. expect to be abused when joining a server, the people are hypocrites.

2) community bans, what this game fails to tell you is that it has its own VAC system,  they use the ""communitybanlist.com/banned"" which should not be there in the first place, and apparently is illegal to use this system in some countries, this site works the same way the social credit score in china works. the part that worries is, that every licensed server uses this site, if you get banned in 1 server, the others will ban you too. there's no such thing as an individual server ban. 
this system has being abused many times and many players are being falsely banned, every ban leaves a record and reasons, the reasons vary from teamkilling, hatespeech, to unknown, what does unknown mean? don't know but you ll get banned anyway.

and yes you can get banned for ""hate speech"" so whenever you want to banter or jokingly use slurs or curse at someone, you will get banned, and be labeled hate speech or ""trolling"".  if any admins are around, if you accidentally kill an admin, whenever ally or foe, expect to get banned. you will get no warnings. though if you try to appeal, even with evidence, they will ignore it. if you try to get help from other people in the community they'll say you deserved it, or act be passive aggressive with you, saying how you shouldn't ruin other people's game or be rude to others, despite having not witnessing it, they're quick to mistreat you. and its disgusting behavior. 

the people saying this are most likely bootlicker clan members, and related, because they assume what you did was wrong with no basis, ""guilty until proven innocent' is how you'll be treated, its not a helpful community, and they want you out more than in. 
overall clan servers are abusive, sketchy and scummy.
people take this game way too seriously and many are very petty and opportunistic, people who never served the army acting like they did, and are running these servers with no purpose in life. 

3) admins are the lowest of the low, so are clans members, they act like gangsters, they're constantly power tripping, doesn't matter the reason they will treat you either with passive aggressiveness, and will assume you are guilty despite being falsely banned, arbitrary judgment, ambiguous rules, hypocrites, straight up lying and gaslighting. they play favorites and manipulate how the game goes in their servers. some of them will do anything if you sound like a girl. try it and watch how the asthmatic mods follow you around.
every clan is an echochamber, they have the gang mentality with no backbone, their only courage is the ban button and hivemind.
they are power tripping sc-m who want  people to use their discord servers for anything, they dont follow their own rules and will gaslight you in being the wrong one. if you're not one of them they will assume you're guilty and demonize you, you cannot question them and you cannot reason with them, its like reddit 2.0. a bunch of gravy seals & special basement operators.
those servers also have other servers in other ""military"" games, it would be wise to blacklist those servers, because they're a bunch of greedy corrupt lowlifes. no integrity, no guilt, no shame, very tribal and primal behavior. hard to believe they lasted this long in life.

Conclusion#) this game is being ruined by admin/clan abuse and have no consequences, as noted by another reviewer, ive experienced what he has, and has 1.4k hours, if i only experience this for only 80 hours, you'll experience this sooner, any mistake you make will be capitalized by petty lowlifes, as more greedy scummy admins who have it out for everyone are banning all server users, with their site claiming banning over 90,000+ players.
the community ban site should not be a feature, and the developers should take action on that. this will kill the player-base.

seeing that this company has hired known greedy CEOs, and how developers were offering leaks of upcoming content in exchange of leaving positive reviews, this company has shown me that its irresponsible, greedy, and shameful, despite how good they craft a game, it won't matter when literal online gangs won't let you play if you hurt their pathetic egos. 

i tried to email support about these concerns, but they refuse to take responsibility.
shame on offworld for allowing this behavior, and refusing to take action, horrible community, horrible company. disgraceful."
"everyone camping get shot 1 time dead, wait for 100 second timer, get out of base get shot again wait 120 seconds, game is absolute garbage, no safezone close to base , hackers everywhere , no replay kill cam, how  is this game even continuing, dont waste your money"
"Tried this during free weekend, too many try hard's being rude to new players. couldn't even enjoy a match in multiple servers"
Fuck this game
"Played the game on promo, no problems. I then bought it and for the first week it was ok. Now it has become unplayable due to  a constant sever disconnect message. 
One day it played fine and once I had paid for it, within a week it was nothing but a source of frustration and irritation."
a game for people who want to feel useless
"edit: ive come back to double down on my review because I have launched it again after successfully reinstalling on a new drive, only to be met with an unskippable video played at deafening audio with no way to turn it down. and after the several minute long video ended it started loading—you mean to tell me that the application chose to do something I didn't ask it do and didnt even do the thing that I asked it to do in the background? have the devs recently read a textbook on how to craft the worst UX possible??

great game, but due to the way it handles updates, you will not be able to play until you find the time to leave steam open for a few hours while it updates, even with an SSD—it has to unpack and repack then validate the entire game, in fact many people find it upwards of 5x faster to entirely uninstall and reinstall when an update of any size comes out."
Game is hella unoptimized cant even get cpu or gpu usage past 50% no matter how I tweak the setting
"ESTE JUEGO ES UNA ESTAFA, NO PUEDES MANEJAR NINGUN VEHICULO A NO SER QUE TE DEN PERMISO O SEAS PILOTO EN LA ESCUADRA, PUEDES CAMINAR DURANTE LARGOS PERIODOS DE TIEMPO Y NO VER A NADIE. ESTAFA TOTAL, NO LO RECOMIENDO, DESINTALANDO AHORA MISMO."
trash game arma 3 infinitely better than this shit game is not all that
this game is not fun
Badmins banning you because their feelings got hurt coupled with Chinas social credit system makes this game lame as hell
game has gone to S H I T
"Squad was a good game. Unfortunately the devs decided to stick with people who either have no aim or a big skill issue. The whole mechanic was only changed for the majority of people who simply couldn't achieve anything in the round because their aim was so bad that they couldn't do any kills or anything else. That's why the devs thought ""Hey, let's listen to Timmy, who loves the game very, very much but unfortunately wasn't much help in his squads in his 2 years of playing time"". Now if someone says ""This is all for the sake of realism""... So a trained US MARINE who is trained for endurance, strength and stamina doesn't run out of steam after a 500 meter sprint. 

[h1]To the devs:[/h1] 
Thanks for destroying a good game like the people at F.....g arrowhead game studios. Maybe you'll bring back the good old squad after all. But I don't really believe it.


[h1]For the player who would like to buy this:[/h1] 
leave it. Don't invest your money in game studios that destroy a game senselessly without any rhyme or reason.

"Terrible performance for an old ass game, runs like absolute pile of dogshit.
Devs couldn't deal with performance issues for years now."
someday the game not work alot crashs
The game went in the wrong direction...
"it wont load, cant play the game i payed 4. nice"
"I want to like this game, here is why I don't. I have friends, I want to play with them most of the servers a near full I can't join up with friends and be on the same team. Instantly annoying and resulting in me not wanting to play this game."
"Revisiting this game after a few years (I forgot basically everything) and being a noob in this game feels like being a toddler fighting alongside the navy seals. People know you are a burden and don't care to explain anything to you. Getting toxic reactions by ""veterans"" for asking noob questions on a so called ""new player friendly server"" is asinine.

Not for me."
trash community
"Riddled with cheaters, has the worst anticheat (easyanticheat) and server owners and admins do nothing. on top of this the people who play it are brain dead and treat the game like COD"
"Honestly, I think Squad is an amazing game and is really fun to play for hours on end... IF you can get the game to function correctly.

I am not recommending this game to other people because I am one of the people who is bogged down with audio bugs, and it does not matter how many 6+ year old Reddit threads I go down with people who have the same problem, or how many times I go to their official Discord requesting assistance, nothing seems to be working or fixing the problem, rendering the game un-playble.

I either have no audio what so ever after launching the game and getting through the trailer to the main menu, or on the chance I can get audio to function, it is entirely mono-sound coming only out of one headphone. Which makes playing the game impossible considering everything at this point sounds like it is coming from your left, while you're essentially deaf in your right ear.

It did not matter how many verification of game caches, re-installs, PC restarts and other long-shot Googled attempts, nothing worked, and Squad was the ONLY game this issue is present in. It has become prevalent to me that OffWorld realizes this game-breaking bug exists (There are unanswered threads on Reddit/online that are, at this point in 2024, over 5-6 years old), but a very small minority of players ever face this issue so it is something they have no idea how to fix, or don't want to spend the time to actually fix it.

My review will remain the same until there is a resolution for this fix, as due to mono-audio, IF you can even get any audio at all to function, makes playing a FPS game impossible (Unless you want a 1/2 Helen Keller experience)."
"Game-breaking bug introduced in most recent update (v8.1) that will not load the game beyond the new intro movie. Game has been out of early access for close to 4 years and despite being fun at times and offering a unique experience, is consistently a buggy mess lacking features its contemporaries offer."
runs very poorly for a game that fully released in 2020..
"The game's performance seems to get worse and worse with each update. The last one forcing me to stop playing it. The gameplay is wonky and unintuitive and a lot of things are incredibly unpolished (lack of respawn option, chat, spawn menu). For a game this old, it still feels like it's in early access. The developers focus on adding new weapons and vehicles which are just re-skins of old weapons. The game is riddled with cheating and exploiting.

I would not recommend this game and instead would point you to projects who's developers seem to actually love their game, i.e. Arma. Reforger does everything squad does but better."
dogshit devs dogshit game only good with mods
Differs vastly from the old BF games as well as ARMA tons of time running around before you get in an engagement and ends pretty quickly. Cant drive or operate vehicles without your squad leaders permission which is also super annoying.
Just play Arma
"The game is a wash. I hear it used to be good until, ICO whatever that is. But, it sucks either way. I paid $30 for the game and after running it for only 3 hours and learning how bad it was, I was denied a refund. The restrictions on equipment operation in game, the incredible lack of weapon interface options, the lack of being able to launch a simple custom server/lobby unless you own or rent a server, the extremely large hole in available control mapping options, the disdain shown to new players by a large part of the player base. It's just really really bad on pretty much all fronts. I've tried to make the best of it and force myself to play but after about 15 mins of it, I can't handle the amount of suck with the game."
This game has been out too long to have this many glitches an bugs
potato ahh game
Не играйте в это
"i got this game in like 2021 when i had a potato pc and got 50 fps, shortly after i get a good pc and averaged 120 fps. now with the good pc i get 50 fps again because of these updates. I have to use dlss and it doesnt look good and 50 fps still?"
"Long and drawn out, very rarely do you have a whole team that will truely work together when that is one of the main draws for the game. Fairly realistic and plays ok, but you feel like a 250 lb out of shape person. Games still shit"
"Залупа, а не игра.В ебучий технике кебабов пушка на танке не перезаряжается."

great game fix ur server list its been a year u fuckwits
"(Would prefer INFORMATIVE over NOT RECOMMENDED)

FYI: The system requirements on the steam page have not been updated in multiple years and it has been showing since at least a year or so.

Squad is a very poorly optimized game that is heavily CPU dependent. According to the system requirements ""any"" 6 core CPU should suffice for ""recommended"" but this is false. Even 6 core CPUs like the Ryzen 5 2600, the  i5-9400F or the i5-10400F paired with the usual GPUs will not put you over more than around 70 fps on low-to-lowest settings, occasionally dipping below 60 fps (sometimes down to 30 fps depending on the situation in game e.g. lots of smoke or particle effects).

Two examples for specs that can run Squad on higher settings without problems are a Ryzen 7 5700X paired with an RX 7600 XT  or a Ryzen 5 7600X paired with an RTX 3070."
dead game f**k ico ruined the game
"Разработчикам лично в глотку кончал, после множественных багов трубы, когда она у тебя не хочет заряжатся, или когда ставишь мину и она не закапывается.

"wtf, i bought squad 3 days ago during the 26 dollar steam sale but was just charged full price for the game"
"The game has CONSISTENLY gotten worse over time. It has no right to run this poorly with the visuals and effects the game offers. The fact games like Hell Let Loose have such better performance is insane. 

Until the devs actually look into bettering performance this is sadly not worth the money,"
I bought it during free weekend and had if for a while but then they took it away from me
"""ICO"" Infantry Combat Overhaul , combined with TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE makes this game unplayably bad.
I will always love SQUAD but this is absolutely unacceptable with 0 redeeming qualities left."
"Every few months I come back to this game with friends, hoping to enjoy it. But despite my best efforts, the fundamentals of the game just aren't fun in my opinion. Before the big gunplay update, I usually enjoyed the game, when I could find a server that actually built supplied bases, but after I can't enjoy it anymore. It makes no sense that even the slightest movement completely obliterates any hope of stable aim, and the average third-world child soldier could handle recoil better than whatever ""professional soldier"" you get the misfortune of playing as."
arma franchise is better in every way unless you prefer fast paced gameplay
NO ! don't lie yourself
A new update destroyed the game. I love trying to drive and set up a fob but get stick shoved my ass by a mini gun
bull shit why cant i swim and a small tree stop A 80TON TANK
"This is a mess. pure cahos.
Can't see shit and impossible distiguish allies and enemies.
Want war sim? get Arma3. If not, get Battlefield"
the game/server is so dependent whether you have a good squad lead. 1 out of 20 you'll get a great game and you'll fall in love. then the next 19 you'll spend 10 minutes running doing nothing with no leadership and die to do it again.Honestly play a game that's more forgiving. this game sucks.
"god i wish the infantry combat overhaul wasn't added, i've seen malnourished somalian child soldiers handle weapons better"
Aiming is extremely clunky and it's 100x harder to see enemies in this game than it is in real life. There is legitimately nothing realistic about how the shooting mechanics work. If you sprint for 2 seconds you can't accurately aim iron sights 10 feet in front of you for 5 minutes. Basically just a walking simulator until you get 1 shot killed from a half mile away
"I had tons of fun with the game play, but the players could be toxic and rude, as well as unkind. Despite this, I think it was a fairly fun game."
"most veteran players i've encountered are just elitists or trolling new players, especially the indonesian players as someone who's playing in the asia server. first 2 days was fun, but went downhill from there. i do not recommend this to casual players, you will feel left out a lot of the time."
"Love squad, stopped playing cause none of my friends played. Redownloaded and now I can't even make it to the main menu. Just see the new intro talking about what squad is and then black screen with three loading dots bottom right and it never stops."
"Unfortunately, the devs are more interested in making skins and silly emotes than actually fixing bugs and game issues.
Best thing to do is just sit around all game, good luck trying to shoot after you move 10ft."
"Absolutely horrendous gunplay, literally play Insurgency Sandstorm or Hell Let Loose, shooting  in a first person shooter game must first and foremost be fun."

-random fps drops
-annoying UI

i didnt even get to play the game
can't join any server
"Game looks like crap, I cant see anything."
its shit
"The game has been nothing but issues.  I have ""played"" for 7 hours according to Steam but I have maybe 3 hours in games.  Of that time I spent 90% of it running to find contact.  Between terrible graphics, crashing games, kicked from ques because they take too long, turtle pace game play; I can honestly say this wasnt worth the $20 I paid."
ICO absolutely ruined this game. Movement is punished severely. The optimal way to play this trash is to sit prone in a bush.
Fuck these people.
i hate this game
"This game somehow rivals No Man's Sky for the title of ""worst tutorial in a game"". Im going to keep playing the game, but the tutorial is dog shit and I hope the devs always have rocks in their shoes and flies in their rooms while they try to sleep. I hope the devs stub the same toe several times throughout the day. I hope the devs have spotty internet which prevents them from playing online games. I hope the devs favorite snack is discontinued. I cant think of any other bad things but i just really need these devs to suffer. Ill change my review if a better tutorial is made"
"1. run across map to fight
2. get killed by something you cant see
3. repeat"
"Well, its a nice game but got some problems: i have to wait 5 seconds to go inside vehicle.I would understand if an animation is ocorring during it like on Arma 3. Something else: my guns dont pierce walls like they should because i shot in direction of someone's head and a aluminium sign was on our way and it saved the enemy from a 7.62 calibre. I understand the enemy dont dying imediantly on some type of walls but on wood and aluminium barriers it shall not stop the bullet. The enemy shall have died. On arma 3 buildings fall but on this game it doesnt happen. Also, was confusing to choose weapons when i started. On arma 3 the arsenal is much more easier. When enemy talk in radio i shall listen if im close to him because this is what prob happen in reality. Granades shall pierce walls or push them out of place since a explosion happens and fragments are spread around the area: u can check by the video of Boston's Pressure Cooker Bomb being remade. I played for 2 days and still not understand what i can do with the resources. 
    I liked how hard was to get a kill. I remember when i was prone and shot. Was like nobody knew about me till i shot: cammo and prone seems really work here instead of arma 3 and getting a kill may be hard as in a war being a rifleman. 
    Arma 3 still being better and Arma Reforger seems to be better than both. I just didnt bought Reforger yet because of how many people still play the Arma 3 and things on workshop. Also, i dont know how is steam's workshop of this game."
"bought this game for the sole intent of playing as a sniper but the retarded devs thought a class system that sets a limit on the amount of players that can play each class per game is a great idea.........

like this game is 70 fucking dollars let me play what ever the fuck i want to play in the manner which i want to play it. 

imagine forcing players into certain roles they dont want to play simply because you don't have a NASA pc and don't load into each game in exactly 0.2 seconds because there are other players racing to pick the class you want to play. absolute dog shit."
"Very boring game, forcing too realistic although not too realistic too.
How can a soldier shoot a gun like an amateur, it is very difficult in this game to shoot a gun even though we are a soldier in this game."
This game is just plain horrible.
"***WARNING*** Edit to my first review: ***WARNING*** Don't think about getting a refund if you even just do the training for 3 hours like I did. I never actually got to play a match due to the toxic bullshit in this game. Do not waste your money.

Its hard to recommend this game, I'd love to but I can't. How does one stay in a match because I either get kicked from the squad I join or out of the entire match due to being brand new to the game. So I'm guessing you either have to find a group outside the game then jump in with them or just mindlessly keep joining till someone allows you to play which is bullshit."
Not worth it
it's lagginf
Game rework made it bad
"poorly optimised, runs 40 fps unless you have a ryzen threadripper or intel 19 or something.
UI is terrible and confusing.
Game cannot find servers with less than 2000 ping"
What the fuck is this latest update
wasn't for me I'm not happy and I wasn't having any fun thats just me someone else can probably have fun with this but not me
They changed the way aiming works to lower the skill ceiling for cringe ass LARPers

"Dear Steam Support,

I recently purchased Squad after trying it during a free play period, but I am now unable to play due to persistent issues with EasyAntiCheat. The game worked perfectly during the trial period, but since purchasing it, I’ve encountered bugs that have rendered it unplayable. Despite the fact that my recent playtime reflects no actual gameplay due to this technical issue, Steam has refused my refund request, citing ""too much playtime."" However, most of this playtime occurred during the free trial period.

I trust that Steam can see the difference between playtime during the free period and after the purchase when the game became dysfunctional. Refusing a refund under these circumstances appears to violate basic consumer protection laws, particularly those that ensure customers receive a functioning product after purchase.

If Steam does not resolve this issue promptly by granting a refund or an appropriate fix, I will explore my legal options, including filing complaints with consumer protection agencies and pursuing chargebacks through my financial institution. Please consider this a formal request for a resolution, and I expect a response within a week.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."
biggest piece of shit to date
"Movement feels like you are wading through the quick sand, aiming and shooting feels like you have tourettes and everyone is a sweaty roleplayer"
"This game is heavy-based mainly on ""good"" squad leaders on each side.
Good squad leader must have appropriate skill, game knowledge and good communication skills.

But there is a big chance that you will play with strange people with no knowledge of game, so you will experience no tactics, no radio commands, no strategy, no knowledge of basic principles of this game.

If you meet the right players, its very good, but the chance to get good players is low and it can take a lot of games / time.

Dear developers - maybe there should be option to prepick a role before join server to get us chance meet players at positions on which they prefer to play and with this maintain and offer a better game experience.

Game maps are big, strategies are uncounted, so dependance on good squad leaders is key.

But right now the chance of getting good Squad leaders is very random - so game experience itself is random too - often I cannot recommend this experience that i had / have."
"Squad is an overall decent game with great innovated gameplay but, it definitely needs work on the mechanics and realism. It really is a big running simulator, maps are too big for the small amount of players that can be in the server. I would definitely recommend ARMA of squad if you are looking for a better alternative."
"Played during free weekend.

Game has too little information on how to play and what to do. The game is too dependant on other players that have a lot of experience in the game to talk newer players through it. I played in a squad that had a good leader who knew what they were doing, it was somewhat fun. As soon as I was in a squad with everyone new, total chaos. No one knew what to do or where to go. So much stuff is not explained. Some of the community can be toxic too, especially on something like a free weekend where there are a lot of new people on, they get quite upset.

TLDR: Game is not good for new players or casual players."
"Great game when you are actually playing it but god forbid you bring a friend along then its a just a massive headache to try and find the same server........ I got one of my friends this game and he was that frustrated with the server list bs and inability to send/recieve game invites drove him to never play it again :) 
All in all GREAT GAME. Horrendous menu design and menu set up."
"Let's be real, the maps are too large and barren which makes it a pain on normal pc's to render, then players have to render mediocre level of detail so that they can stare at blades of grass as they get shot from any place not directly in front of the gun's barrel. Player characters act as though they have never held a firearm let alone a repeating firearm, and the inaccuracy visually seen from hipfire aids this conclusion. Overall this entire game is clunky, slowly animated, and while the developers went for realism and a simulator experience, they seem to have stepped too far and have actually disconnected the player. If this were truly a realistic first person shooter, the character wouldn't go about in such a clunky manner but fluidly, as this would come from the representation of real world practice and training.  

It CAN be fun with friends but there is no active social tab so you can't party up beforehand and join a server together, if you get separated into another squad you are essentially playing a whole different game than your friends as the map does not lend itself to finding your steam friends nor does it really clarify what areas are active fighting and not. We accept this game as the standard for a realistic military shooter, when really it is the lowest common denominator."
cannon go kaboom and then guns shoot bang bang and dead
This game is very fun but isn't optimized for AMD hardware can't get over 20 fps on low settings with a 6600xt and with this new update it made it worse.
"Hi, i feel like its finally time to write a review...  i feel like this is no longer the same game that i paid $50 for. i hardly see any actual teamwork anymore. i saw more teamwork in the game pre-ico than now. it feels like the more that the dev's (try) to push teamwork, the less of it there is. not to mention, as a heli pilot, every update makes helis less fun to fly. when mapvoting came out and they removed a bunch of layers, they also made it so that helis have a spawn delay with most units and increased the actual respawn timer for it. and now with this update they added a ""fun"" new heli to fly, yet it only takes one 7.62 bullet to engine it, so if any infantry just shoot in you general direction, you die... not only that, but they changed everything about how the helis fly. they all feel fat and slow now,  and it feels like every update they change the helis in some way but never put anything in the patch notes about it. like when they added a line in the code in the new update that makes helis fly away if the pilot gets out with the engine on, even when completely landed. again, they dont even put any of these changes in the patch nots."
"do you want to play a game where you shoot a gun like a 10 yr old girl and have 0 ability to even remotely stabilize the firearm in a realistic manner in any position? yeah me either, this game used to be fun."
"the game is good, on a base level. the community isnt what it used to be, no one plays together or with a mic, its just a bunch of silent murder hobos wasting tickets every game. then every time they update they dont communicate or work with the major mod authors who are carrying this game on their back as if they were atlas, so every time they update its like 2 months with no mods and just a skeleton of a playerbase. game is good with mods"
Good game but use a better anticheat. EAC is more like Easy To Cheat.
"Este juego exprimio al máximo mi RX570. Sé que mi GPU está un poco vieja, pero de verdad creo que este juego necesita urgentemente un trabajo de optimización. A pesar de eso, es un  buen fps de corte realista, aunque tiene algo de walking simulator.

This game stressed the shit out of my rx570. I know my gpu is a little old but I seriously think this game needs an urgent optimization work on it. Despite that, it's a cool game, a liitle of walking simulator though."
without friends this is really boring.
Unable to join any multiplayer servers.
"THIS GAME HAS BECAME SO UNPLAYABLE AND UNENJOYABLE SINCE THE SQUAD OVERHAUL IM JUST A REGULAR GAMER AND I DON'T ENJOY NOT BEING BALE TO SEE SHIT THROUGH MY SCOPE OR MY SOLDIER HAVING TERRIBLE AIM SHOOTING ENEMIES 20 FEET INFRONT OF ME , I CAN AIM BETTER THAN THIS IN REAL LIFE , THIS IS FAR FROM REALISTIC PLS STOP UR DESTROYING THE GAME JUST LIKE TARKOV"
"So buggy, combat is janky. When I heard free to play wekeend I was like 'yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah' and then I played it for the first time and it reminds me of something someone built in their room with a limited team throwing Dayz and somethign else together."
"Weapon mechanics suck, too much recoil, the body movement feels like you are dragging a slug around....just Go buy ARMA 3"
"Overrated. Huge bf2player. Sky is mine. Hello dragon valley!?
Honestly I had high hopes for squad. I tried it,  the gameplay just sucks… no need for constructivist. Love taro bf3,4. Even arms 3 more playable to me. Mechanics of game are strange and certainly didn’t win me. Game overrated to much unneeded hype. Gun play awful and after nothing much interesting. I thought this going to be bf2.0"
"Squad is a dishonest enterprise with false advertisement.
Admin abuse is the norm.
Kicked out of vehicle to steal it.
Kicked out of squad to steal it.
There are no official servers, only admin abused ones. *""YoU DiDnT ReAd RuLeS"" imbeciles incoming*
INTENTIONAL Teamkilling renders the game unplayable.

The single most toxic community I have seen, especially the ethnically abused servers. 

Squad devs are dishonest over false advertisement of a cooperation game. Clans abusing admin rights occupy one faction and the other faction is filled with randoms (No choice to pick faction!).

There is nothing done against admins or anyone cheating, nor can be done.

Give me my money back! Keep your stupid teamkilling admin abused theft called ""squad"". SHAME!"
"My experience so far is that the game sucks and I would rather wait at the DMV for my license photo. 2.5 hours in, and I just played for 30 minutes as my squad mate couldn't drive a vehicle across a map, fail to get gas and I had to run all the way across a map for the game to finally end. 2.5 hours in and I've only had the opportunity to shoot at 1 person. Yes, BF and COD suck, but at least when I am in a game, I'm playing and not riding in a Humvee for 30 minutes to not play. I would rather just by ""Public Bus Riding"" the game."
"Refuses to connect to any servers, so since this is a multilayer game, it's completely useless. What's more, Steam has refused a refund despite this. What a scam."
"A s**ity want to be military sim. Terrible mechanics and comms system, very buggy and poorly designed maps. Fallujah the game runs and looks better than this ****"
Its like playing with Unity Graphics like SCP SL
SED I CANT DO JIHAD
"SQUAD was better when the game was focused more on Infantry and some limited infantry vehicles,
meaning i was liking the game alot Pre Alpha V11, pre Alpha V10 was Perfect.

I didnt like the Update where it was suddenly required to use crewman kits to drive BTR´s,
I didnt like the change on the rally point system, 
I didnt like the change on the FOB/HAB System.

overall long intense Infantry firefights where fun, with every update they have become less and less.
with every new Country that was added Britain / Canada, and the overall adding of more and more long distance scopes for regular rifleman,those shootouts have become almost non existent. 

as well as well as MEGA FOBS are not a thing anymore, due to changes on the FOB/HAB system.

Game needs a Mod where 80% auf the Squad is Iron Sights only, and those changes are reversed.

think im gonna pass on SQUAD and try SQUAD44."
CCP copy of battlefield mod 😂😂😂
"I really enjoyed squad initially. The biggest its drawback was that shooting didn't feel that great in terms of bullet impacts. The enemy death animations also were sort of disconnected from you, meaning you didn't really feel like you killed a guy. Everything else, including the gunplay itself, was very much enjoyable. 

Now, I haven't played Squad for a few years, and when I came back, I was shocked how the shooting became so much worse. The guns' sounds are a lot better, there's this heaviness to your shots, but at the same time the recoil has been exaggerated to pre-recoil patch Tarkov levels. Like you're not playing as a trained soldier but as that soldiers' mom who never held a gun in her life. Even single-fire M4 is hard to keep on stationary target, there's so much random variation in the sprays, it feels miserable to shoot guns now. DMRs force you to make huge pauses between shots if you wanna stay anywhere near the target. I understand there may have been some balancing decisions they had to make, but right now the game feels awful to shoot. There's close to zero individual skills involved, because even if you do have the aim, you can't control your gun no matter how much you practice since the recoil is so random and sideways. This forces you to single fire, but even single fire feels terrible because it recoils super hard to either of the sides, once again forcing you to fire even slower if you want to hit your shots. I don't understand why a mil sim would opt for such a poor balancing strategy while also making one of the key things, which most mil sims are about - shooting guns - comletely horrible. 

Pistols have insane recoil too, as if you shoot with one arm, which also happens to be broken in 3 spots. 

I don't really like the way shooting feels right now, so I can't recommend it, especially because it felt a lot better a few years ago. If you don't care about guns being bad and unpleasant to shoot, then you might like the game, but if you value having some 'realness' to your guns, then it's not a game that delivers that."
The shooting mechanics are horrible. You either move the weapon to fast or to slow and its very shaky. Grande throwing mechanics remind me of a 90s PC game. In fact most the game looks like its was made in 2005.
Every action you do in this game feels like your doing it underwater
absoloutley noone playing????
Really stupid game.DONT BUY!!!!!
"Played for the YT Cool Mods.........Zero Cool Modded Servers..............Bad Experience.
Luckily I didn't bought this Garbage."
30FPS SIMULATOR
dont buy this game its not worth.... toxic community full of trols waste of money
"floating rocks, spawning on enemies, being killed by friendlies in smoke. I don't get it."
"Game is garbage, never see the enemy, character never holds the gun steady, 2 rounds of 7.62 doesnt kill anyone. Absolute garbage game. WASTE OF TIME"
game isn't fun
"Do not take it wrong, this game is very good, but not really new players friendly.
However, there are so many points which people need to think about when buying this game.

The most frustrating point is that you will get kicked for alot of reasons. Teamkilling is one reason to be kicked, but this is not a point since it just happens and you have the possibility to appologize. 
E. g. you get pushed as a squad leader and you do not have the correct kit and have not possibility to change it when you are in the battlefield or even do not realize you are the leader now, because you are in a firefight right now.

The next point is that most players lock their squads with one or two players, so you end up mostly alone or with two other players in a squad, together with the restriction above. However, you get kicked out of a squad sometimes, because you have 0 hours in this game? People just do not want you to play with. I mean everyone started low once, but this is not the way to treat new players in such a game.

Additionally, the key bindings are very strange. If you want to bind something to a new key, they are not disbanded. This means, if you bind grenades to ""E"", then you will end up switch to grenades while leaning to the right side.

I really wanted to enjoy this game, since the setting and the idea is very good, but it was simply not possible."
"bad for new players, game is just bad"
you can buy this game if you have friends and a 4090
$20 game at best. Floppy arms for a trained Soldier. Spend most of the game getting bossed around by the squad leader by the time you get any action the game ends Hell let loose is a better game
"cheap arma ripoff, istg"
honk shoo
boring
game crashes 10 times before you even get into a server browser............
"While I have been enjoying some aspects of the game, there are too many ways this game doesn't respect your time.
The fact that someone can just kick you out of a vehicle half way to the battle front because they aren't your squad leader is extremely dumb. 
You can then choose to then A: Leave the game and spend 10+ minutes to find a new game B: spend 10+ minutes running to the front or C: Hope there's water nearby to drown yourself. There's no option to respawn, you have to ask permission to your squad leader to even drive a vehicle, and no one stops for you on their way to the front, they just run you over. 

I enjoy the game when I can play the game, but this game gives too much faith in the players to not make other peoples experiences miserable by team killing."
"so many bugs, sever lists wont show, so many black screens, connection timeouts etc"
just die from nowhere simulator
Bad performance
Di map nah mek no sense an hard fi read. No sight pon wah a gwan. Bumbaclot! I an I!
"Redownload to play with a friend. Get stuck in an insanely loud intro video I can't even ALT+F4 to close, then stuck in an endless loading screen. Sick.

Update: I get to keep watching this video over and over. Best part is it somehow overrides my audio when I literally mute the game, and forces my audio mixer into not responding til the game is forced closed when I can finally get the task manager to respond. So sick."
t
ass
this game is absolute dog water dont waste your time
"This game's physics are realistic, They are so real it's like I'm really there and the 100 player battles are just so exciting that when the game finally loads on my DELL optiplex, My computer freezes and gives me a nice blue screen :( pls address a fix to this game now!!!!!!!!



my pc has a gt 710 and a intel core i7 2nd gen and 8gbs of ddr3 ram

Is it good enough?!?!?!?!??!?!?!!??"
"2010s gameplay, 2000s graphics, shitty experience. I regret free weeekend trial, not to mention buying this crap"
"Terrible, got the game for free weekend and its downloaded, waited 1+ hour to play it[due to downloading] and when i enter the game the warning for epilepsy pops up then it kicks me from the game please get ti fixed devs"
TRASH ASS GAME < GUN WILL NOT SHOOT BUGGY CLANKY BAD GUN PLAY JUST TRASH
"playing this game is miserable, 99% of the time, you are in a group with utter idiot and half the of that time they cant even organize getting out of base. most of the games you get in, the squad barely communicates, if you enjoy milsim but are a solo player, id avoid this shi entirely."
this game is ass dont play
"hi all, game is one battlebit clone with some arma battlefield features. what is bad you cant see right who is enemy and fx is not 2024 standard at all, more like battlebit minecraft cube explosions.... so no buy but game have good basis. may some like it, i play battlebit also only occasionaly."
Its only fun when you dont care about absolutely lighting up your teammates
"Running animations are a bit moonwalk type and feels like from free unity game, project reality older but better."
"Spent 2 hours trying to find a match. Tried every fix on google, still cant get into a game. L"
Downloaded it for the free weekend trial and glad I did. The audio settings are so atrocious I wasn't able to get audio in and out at the same time even with 3rd party software recommended by the devs. save your money.
Actually enlisting and going through BCT is more fun than this game.
"Squad is a blast, but boy, can it be confusing! The game’s concept is super fun and unique, but it could really use more tutorials and training. I mean, how are we supposed to figure out the game’s ecosystem, communication, reporting, and map interactions without some guidance? And what the heck are FOBs? Who makes them, and what do they need?

And then there’s the squad leader. Who is this mysterious figure, and what are they supposed to do? They definitely need some special training. Same goes for the commander. Both roles should have mandatory tutorials before they can lead a squad or command anything. And the commander’s abilities? Yep, those need a tutorial too.

I know, they have a ""minor"" tutorial out there, but that doesn't cover even 1 tenth of the game's techniques and hidden stuff.

FYI, I only played the trial game during the free weekend event, and honestly I am not sure if i'm going to buy it or not, it still needs some refinements and improvements."
PIP SCOPES ruin your performance
"Do you enjoy gameplay that involves:

Waiting around for something to happen 90% of the time?

Clunky, awkward infantry combat?

Low quality, clunky character animations?

Frustrating map and game-mode design?

Then this game is for you!

Seriously though, avoid this low effort garbage fps unless your IQ is in the bottom 1% percentile."
Everyone who plays this game sounds like they eat crayons
"1. Spawn in main base
2. Wait one hour to get into a moving vehicle
3. Arrive in the middle of nowhere
4. Get blown up by an RPG"
What the frack?! Does not work for me.
fucking shit ass game my teammates killed me more than the enemy
"Just another tacticool shooter who thinks its ""realistic"" to make it literally impossible to aim if bullets are fired within your general area. Last time I checked we weren't using bullets with explosive charges attached so there's no reason there would be any kinetic force from a bullet impacting concrete in front of you. 
Even when you're [i]NOT[/b] being fired at the game is constantly fighting you for control since there is [b]no way to stabilize a scope even while prone[/b]. And that's saying nothing about the recoil kicking like a mule.
I've talked with real soldiers who were afraid they'd black out from nervousness when a firefight broke out, but in reality the exact opposite happened as everything became clear."
"This game plays like Arma, with annoying controls, snipers glore and a lot of time-wasting elements. I dont know what else to say its extremely uneventful and a massive majority of your deaths will feel like there is nothing you can do about them."
"""aim""
no
""aim"" 
no
""aim""
yes

rather play any fps from ps3 to today than this empty game"
The scope sway is a mistake. I absolute hate it that you can't even hold your breath or something to control the damn sway.
"Well, the game seems deep and complex. Is is a nice large scale combat simulator. The problem in that complexity is that the tutorials are too shallow and even in the servers marked as ""new player friendly"" people will keep asking you to leave their squads (even before the game starting, so they don't know if you are a good player or etc. They wanna play with the people they know). After this you end up in a squad where no one knows what they are doing or alone. Then the game becomes a random walking simulator.

So, 3/10 for a game that seems nice, but needs to do a lot more work on guiding new players."
"During the tutorial the live fire part had such loud sudden and loud audio (with headset on) that my ear has been ringing in a tinnitus manner. I can only hope I haven't gotten permanent hearing damage, but it's been twelve hours at this point. Not exactly what I was hoping from this game."
"this game has a finnish map but no finnish faction.

unbelievable.

outrageous.

0/5"
it needs to be 13 pluss so me and my friend can play togather and i dont think its is 13 pluss because its famili friendly
hot dog water ass gun play. Not haram
"I cannot believe this kind of game does not support multiple input and TRackIR.
If you want a war simulator. ARMA would be better. even the graphic quality cannot as good as squad, but there are more details in ARMA."
"My opinion is mostly divided when it comes to reviewing this game. It takes time to understand how to play this game well. That said, it is definitely not beginner-friendly. I had to play a couple of real matches to understand what the tutorial section was all about.

The biggest problem for me personally is the gun mechanics. I have played a lot of arcade-style games like Counter-Strike and Insurgency, and the recoil in this game is the worst I have ever seen. Even when using a bipod in the prone position, your character still wobbles. After pressing the button to stabilize, you have to wait an additional five seconds for the aim to temporarily settle, and even then, landing a distant shot feels like a gamble. This only gets worse when you are being shot at by the enemies.

Now combine that with not being able to easily identify teammates from enemies. It becomes a staring contest with the player in front of you who is pointing a gun at you, also appearing to have the same questioning look. You decide to pull the trigger first, only to realize it was your teammate you just killed. Guilt-Quit
It takes some experience to get used to the uniforms of different factions. Until then, you have to constantly rely on opening your map to double-check, as only friendlies are shown on the map. However, this still doesn't stop you from getting killed by your teammates.

Positioning is more important than getting quick kills. It quickly becomes frustrating when the enemy wipes out your entire squad and you have no idea where the shots are coming from—though it can be satisfying when you're the one on the other end. Unlike the games I mentioned, camping is praised here.

Communication is not optional. The game doesn't care if you are an introvert. It forces you to get out of your comfort zone and speak with your squeaky voice. If you don't speak, get ready to be disrespected by other players on the radio or, worse yet, get kicked out of the squad. I mainly blame this on the inability to put markers on the map (unless you are a squad leader) or use pre-recorded voice commands while pointing in a direction, like in other games.

There is a steep learning curve to this game, which I (ironically) admire. You can have fun if you know what you are doing. There are a lot of other team-supportive things you can do besides just shooting at other players.

TL;DR Squad could have been a great game for me, but the frustrating gunplay holds it back. If the shooting mechanics were more manageable, I'd have considered writing a positive review."
"full with a bunch of sweaty, salty, angry, stinky, imbred, overweight, radioactive, full time truck driving australians."
where the fuck i am ?
I joined in wanted to kill other people couldnt find them so i tried to get to them but out of nowhere the game put itself in window mode but the button layout was like in fullscreen
govno
hard to control
ICO ruined this. Rubber noodle arms aren't realistic or fun. Have fun with Tencent draining every last penny with more microtransactions.
"Gun play feels like dog shit, every gun has the recoil of a deagle"
My laptop is too shitty to handle this game. :( OPTIMIZE UR GAME
"Spawned at a fob had to walk all the way to point because my squad leader didn't clam a car, finally got to point after 5 min of running just to get gun downed by some guy with an lmg in a bush (He was my teamate), the game play loop feels clunky and slow for the type of game it is. the only good part of the game is the tanks and helis but there are other games with that... (I played during free weekend to give it a try after seeing videos about it and how fun it is. But i was dissapointed due to only having 2 fun ish interactions throughout the five hours that i played."
nah
"i mean, with all due respect, if you ain't got a whole ass squad to literally ROLEPLAY with, don't even bother, game is absolute trash if you're looking for a good shooter as a single player."
Shitty game with broken server browser
"A steaming pile of horse shit.   

Nothing else worth noting."
i can't get on games can't skip intro
haven't played a worse game to date
mmmm. NO
"游戏的交互趣味全靠百人混战强撑，因为这样可以遇见相对较多的散落遭遇战，[b] 看似需要团队，实则一盘散沙，理解机制后各自为政，人人都是孤狼兵王，说着从别人那捡来的蹩脚圈内笑话，以显自己懂行内道。游戏体验大多就是分了两个派别的PUBG大乱斗。 [/b]当然也有不错的极少数玩家会重视互动和配合，也只是极少数，更多是爱开麦的pugs，聒噪不安，自得其乐。

       The interactive fun of the game is all supported by the melee of 100 people, because in this way you can meet relatively many scattered encounters, which seem to require a team, but in fact, they are scattered, and after understanding the mechanism, they go their own way, everyone is a lone wolf soldier king, saying lame jokes picked up from others, in order to show that they know the inner way. Most of the game experience is PUBG Smash Bros. divided into two factions. Of course, there are also a very small number of players who will attach importance to interaction and cooperation, and only a very few, more of them are pugs who love to open the microphone, noisy and restless, and enjoy themselves."
NO
"Awful new player experience.

Join game, Join squad, get kicked from squad, get kicked from game because you aren't in a squad.
Join new game, Join squad, get promoted to squad lead, get kicked because you don't have squad leader kit.

Legit a dogshit new player experience."
would have reccomended about 5 big updates ago but the combat is kinda trash right now
where is the optimization
"Tldr: tried on a free weekend not recommended for people trying to get in to milsims and the toxicity outweighed the people willing to help new players learn 

Tried on a free weekend 
While I can see the appeal of this game coming from arma I also feel like the good players are outnumbered by players who either don't understand that this is a milsim that requires cooperation or are just purely toxic. And while I don't have much time in the game I also feel like the movement is slow clingy and not fun and neither is the aiming its slow shaky and takes to long to recover from recoil. 
The servers marked newbie friendly aren't as friendly as I hoped for. This game had been on my wish lost for quite a while and since playing for a few hours has been removed. I hoped I would enjoy it but I feel like the time barrier to enjoyment is too long"
"Дерьмище игра хочет идти в реализм, но срет поносом себе в трусы сделали бы так как в пабге все было бы намного лучше, а так я зашел сидеть в таверне 30 секунд вместо того что бы рубится ЖЕСТКО и потом встаю и как пьяный наркоман в прицеле меня трусит"
Garbage game. Most maps will have you at 40 fps with a decent computer.
"Barely works on recommended hardware. 5-10 second freezes and sub 40 fps at minimal settings. Gameplay wise it's fine, arcade-ish enough to get right into the gameplay."
server list doesn't work
Too complicated with hard to spot teammates
"The game is awesome. (3.8/10) -- for now until they optimized it then it's auto+5
The teamwork and planning executed beforehand to properly plan victory is very nice.
Playing with friends and absolutely annihilating the enemy team - but then not knowing where you died from.

The game is nice a solid 3.8/10
Why? Because the Developers lack transparency and do not have their priorities set straight.
They need to optimize the game, if you don't have a really good CPU do not play, buy or install."
worst weapon feeling i ever had in a game
"Tried it on the free weekend, glad i did, and not wasted money on this. The game is fine, but the community is extremely hostile towards new players and experienced players dont help when asking questions.  On top of that servers kick you for a lot of reasons, even if they automove you to a new role that you don't have the appropriate kit for... Don't get it if you plan on casually playing, the veterans don't want you in their game."
"Great game and simulates large scale conflict really well with quite a lot of strategic depth.
But, shooting a gun and basic firefight feels very janky."
Can't easily join game with friends and not new player friendly.
"game is fine but community is unbearable. experienced players won't teach new players just be annoying and tell you to play the tutorial when you ask a simple question. Do not buy this game, the experienced players don't want you in their game and they don't want to teach you, its unfortunate."
"Good game but it sucks on my computer, takes 15 minutes before it decides to log me into a match"
"This game is clunky and absolute dog crap. Under the guise of being ""realistic"" when it's just absolute shite. The player base is nothing but a bunch of douche bags who drive everyone new away who has the desire to even bother trying this turd of a game. Do NOT waste your money I am sure that there will be a better game around the corner than this sack of petrified crap."
WHY IT DOSN'T SUPPORT STEAM FAMILY!!
nah
"Boring game, no1 wants to play squad lead, no1 plays game properly and puts down spawn points, so every match is a walking simulator. do not recommend."
"Game looks rough and plays worse. The animation makes it feel like your arms are made of wet spaghetti and your legs are cheese strings. After launching you get blasted repeatedly with warnings about needing to put your mic on so you can pretend to be in the army alongside Kev who works at a Tescos in Rotherham. You then clumsily stumble around some dilapidated copy pasta environments until you accidentally shoot a bot team mate and then get told to apologise in the general chat channel by a all-caps pop-up. I guess this isn't for me, so I'd probably give it a neutral if that were a thing."
nop
"Thought good things about this game,sadly it’s very boring, not newbie friendly at  all. Prone simulator ."
"The game is boring and a complete waste of time, if you want something similar/military experience just buy Arma instead.. Running for 30 minutes to get killed by a tank is quite the experience"
"VERY BAD GAME, THIS GAME IS SHT!!!!!!!"
"Barely got to play it when i bought it back in lord-knows-when

Came back now as friends are playing the free weekend, and nomatter the methods i attempt i cannot find any servers, even though all my friends can.

Quite literally, not even excagerating, unplayable for me."
to many toxic team mates
NO
"I downloaded this game as part of a free play event. I was hoping to see if this game was as welcoming as Arma and Insurgency. The first game I play, all the squads are either full or locked, so I have to start my own squad. I then get pulled into a squad by an admin just before the prep phase ends. I then try to get into the troop carrier that my squad members are in but before I could get in, they drive off, leaving me to have to walk a few kilometres to the AO. As soon as I get there I am blown to bits by an enemy APC due to how open the area was and the fact that I had no mode of transportation thanks to my squad abandoning me. Compared to Arma 3, which I paid full price for, I would not buy Squad even though it is 60% off. Unless you join a game full of entirely new players, this game will not be welcoming."
Audio does not work.
"-Spawn in on base, walk out of base, instantly get sniped by a lone enemy who flanked in the trees with no way to see or counter him. 
-Spawn in on a point getting attacked, try to do literally anything like peek a window or peek onto a street only to get blown up or shot by enemies you can't see
-Finally see a enemy running across a field i can shoot and kill, oh wait it was a teammate i just killed because there is literally no way to differentiate enemies and friendlies because most of the time the blue name tag that appears when you aim at friendlies doesn't appear.

Game suffers from the same problem all mil-sims do, you try and play the game and you instantly die for it. I spent the whole time sitting in the base because the second i walked out i would instantly die from unseen enemies. I never saw a single enemy during that time either, even in CQC situations. Only time i had fun is when i watched my spawn point get peppered by a gatling gun but i couldn't even enjoy it because the game shat itself and went down to like 10 fps

That and the game has poor optimization and the tutorial kinda sucks and tells you stuff like peek a enemy MG to suppress him or shoot the hull of a Abrams to kill it."
"For a realistic shooter, everything feels so fast to arcady feeling. Combat for some reason doesn't feel rewarding. Vehicles are garbage from both physics aspect to sound effects. Whole UI could really use overhaul - too much text, needs to be simplified. Players are nice. When compared to HLL, although it does not really feel much similar, Squad feels like more progressive uglier sibling for younger generation. I did not like this at all."
"The gamplay is not enjoyable at all. its slow, laggy. you have to walk hundred miles before getting shot out of no where. the shooting mechanics suck. i am surpirsed at the guys who gave it good review. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL. i would rate it 2/10."
BTEC HLL
"wow the first 3 minutes tells me all the thing that will get me kicked or banned. then drops me into a parking lot 55 miles away from the city.  oh I need to be in a squad to enter the vehicle...

good thing they have free weekend so everyone can see get their 8 minutes in before uninstalling."
"i have huge lag spike when playing with servers, 10/10"
"They still haven't fixed the audio card issues. It's something to do with their use of EasyAnticheat as Halo MCC had the same issue on launch. The opening cutscenes have audio, but the game engine proper refuses to see any output audio device in its settings. 'Shame :("
walking simulator
"Would not recommend, there are so many small super annoying things in the game that should ""make it more realistic"" all it does it reduce playability."
The most fun I've had shooting my friend in the face and reviving him by bandaging his manhood.  Other than that its utter sh!te.
"asthmatic running simulator, don't play if you forgot your inhaler"
"Needing someone to be a delivery boy and drive ammo and construction supplies to the front lines is realistic, not fun. The time it takes to see if who you're aiming at is friendly takes way too long, I know you can identify teams by uniform, but in a game where you can die in one shot, there's no room for hesitation or else you die. I was hoping this was like Hell Let Loose but modern, but unfortunately, Squad chose to put realism over fun."
Nothing like using up 80 gigs of space on your computer just to get hit with the infinite loading screen bug that was never fixed from the start. Be mindful that this is after watching their unskippable 5 minute long intro
this game sucks what game is named squad and you cant even squad up with your friend 0 out of 10 disgusting game. unhappy non customer FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.
"This game literally is so dumb and bad, glitchy and not sense of hit reg, would not recommend ever free"
Terrible.  Unless you have your own team it is nothing but crap.
Please don't waste your time with this trash game. I had so many issues on both my laptop and computer that has different specs to just get the graphics correct that it kept bugging out and making the gaming experience terrible. No thank you.
"LOVED THIS GAME TO THE MAX!...UNTIL free trail . it has become instantly a racist sanctuary. almost every game getting spammed with racism by team and enemy team. server admins do NOTHING at all for the better of the game and neither does the game itself. i know they cant watch everything but a kid joining with the username ""white leader"" spamming the N word shouldnt be hard. 6 games ive played tonight alone and was unable to complete due to a child spamming racism."
it's kinda ass ngl... I wouldn't buy it unless you can try it first
kinda bad ngl
What a piece of shit.  I'm so glad I checked it out during the free weekend and didn't buy it.
horrible shit game do not play it
Fix your broken dumbass game
"Chaos unless you bring your own squad,  everyone has to be on the same page or you get smoked."
Meh
"not gonna, I find this game a lot harder than Hell let loose; and while I'm still relatively new with this game at the time of this review, I understand the fundamentals and everything since I've played hell let loose, but this game is a different breed despite being in the same bag. with the ICO overhaul making gun play a lot more difficult than before just makes this game even more harder; despite it attempting to encourage more suppression and penalize run and guns; while retaining a realistic senses, but this is supposed to be designed from its original mod development of BF2 where it retained realistic aspects but maintained a middle ground because of BF2's engine and gun play, this game is already full of stuff significantly more which is already harder enough to learn especially when your learning solo, and transitioning from a different similar game. Them forcing the ICO aspect isn't a good one because everyone has to significantly change their styles of play with an even more slower pace, more team oriented game; as If they wasn't difficult enough with squads style.

If your considering this game; PLEASE play with friends, it will make it way more easier."
just a nope kind of game cant even use what  you really want. im good glade it was free lol
"wait in 2 min Que. Join losing team. Game resets. Enter gae. Wait few mins for prep faze. Drive 3 mins to point. Build FOB on point. Get artillery striked for 2 mins. die. Fob ded. Ride in vehicle for mins. return to ded fob to arti ded again.  if u get no permission for vehicle run 10 mins...
..... ... . ...
BUT IF YOU HAVE A SQUAD... this game can be fire."
"Take all the bad aspects of Arma, the walking, long distances, being one shot. 

The horrible, community of Mil sim units. 

Now make that an entire game! 

If you like Milsim stuff, and long distances, and working with teams. This game will be great for you. 

If you hate walking 15 minutes to objectives, being one shot from god knows where. Spending a lot of time doing very little to get set up.  This game isnt for you.

It knows its crowd it has its crowd. I just wish for an actual good fucking battlefield game to come back out."
dogshit boring walking simulator
i wouldnt mind the into video but at least make it so it doesnt bloody stutter.
"Worst tutorial experience, bad graphics, UI meh. Really hard to identify enemies to friendlies, only close encounters to distinguish them. Like my max average kills are around 2-3 people.. By the way thanks for free weekend, I'll just save and spend my money elsewhere :)"
Actual garbage. I am glad I never paid for it.
Battlefield V
Absolutely wank
"Pros:
- Decent audio design
- Decent realism

Cons:
- Poor gameplay mechanics 
- Shitty optimization and performance
- Bad graphics quality
- The worst User interface/experience
- Wonky controls"
"Looks bad, shoots bad, plays bad."
"I can see why this game needed a free weekend, you're better off hiking in the woods because that's the majority of what you'll be doing in this game."
Very chaos game no body follow the leaders instruction and you cant recognize enemies from teammate and most of the time you get killed by friendly fire
what a disgusting pile of garbage
A big pile of laggy poopoo
"ruzzian supporters! you can play under their flag, how come? just remove that and someone will maybe come back"
Almost can't believe that I still need to look at something like that in 2024. :*(
"Can't play squad with squad, misleading title"
"game's called squad and you cant team up with friends, good job devs"
Can't play squad with squad
"The game really plays like battlefield - there a a good server browser, classes, squads, kits etc. and lots of different nationalities you can play as. Anyway I was hugely disappointed as the game isn't much fun at all.

As for gameplay itself, the map is confusing and its difficult to know what to do and where to go to. The landscape maps are much too large (often with little cover) and you find yourself just running round for ages looking for someone to shoot. Die to a sniper, respawn and then run for 5 minutes looking for an enemy, rinse repeat.

Sound is good but the graphics are quite bad. The game is 4 years old now but it actually looks much older and not much better than Battlefield 2 which came out 19 years ago."
"devs need to revise the keybind rework, i want to use the namepad for something else outside of radio coms however the game severely limits the ability to rebind stuff. even if i set a keybind to numpad it simply doesn't work."
"great concept, very buggy."
Mid and people expect you to roleplay lmao
no
"Its just like Hell let loose but in modern warfare...if you enjoy long respawns and 5m walking until  you find some1 to engage or something then that game is for you.

i dont like that kind of shooting games"
"When you are removed from a squad you just lose your weapon even if you are in middle of a fight. Then you kill them anyway but there is no way to pickup their weapoan, not even ammo or heals. 

You just killed a full squad and they have a running BTR next to you? Well its theirs cause you cant take it even if they are all dead. 

Best tactict is to just sit in any window. And shoot heads. F/O identification sucks. No armbands, not even in city combat.

Also there are no drones."
"Easy Anticheat?  (Basically malware, and not disclosed on store  page.  Store page states ""Valve Anti Cheat"" instead) You only find this out on the loading screen shortly before it crashes.

Waste of 80GB of bandwidth

Hard pass."
"This game has been on my wish list for a while now, so when I saw it on sale I downloaded the trial. Overall, the game has good game mechanics and visuals - but if you plan to play this on a TV (couch gaming), forget it! Some menu interactions could be bigger but the surprise for me is the map coordinate numbers - wowzers, so tiny and unclear! This is extremely illogical as this is meant to be a squad based game. The description box that you get when you hover over each setting is practically unreadable and there are no accessibility options either. Yet another game developer who doesn’t appear to be interested in catering to those who game on a TV and also discriminates those of us with visual impairments. Pity as I would have purchased it otherwise."
"Like so many milsims before, it can get kinda boring eventually from extreme repetitiveness, and is poorly optimised, and extremely buggy.
So many times will you get stuck in walls, sync will make people look like there looking the other direction, and then they start shooting from the back of their head, and so many more bugs.

There can sometimes be cheaters, but they aren't that common, but when there are cheaters theres no point staying on the server anyway. Such as one time when supposedly a player got 61 kills and only died once playing pure CQC.
There are also some maps that just aren't that great because they are completely dominated by vehicles and if you're not in a vehicle then there's nothing to do, because you'll be spawned in an open plain with no cover for as far as the eye can see and some vehicle will eventually kill you while you're looking for any kind of cover.
And this point can be seen as a good or bad thing, but the success of you're team is completely reliant on the competence of your superiors, who 60% of the time are not competent, a lot of the time having the very good idea of; rush the enemy head on and keep respawning until you ""win"" or get defeated.
But when the game is good, its amazing.
Also the community can be very bad at times

Though the ICO systems have been updated, the game still is extremely buggy, poorly optimised and server sync is awful.
And optimisation recently has definitely gotten worse.

On sale for 70% or more, and i definitely would recommend it, otherwise, i think its overpriced for what it is, at the moment.

6.5/10"
"Horrible game for wide screen.
All settings and display issues.
Hopless game ever."
Az önce sıçtım daha optimizeydi.
Terrible game
"Very slow. Very boring. Relies a lot on teamwork to be fun, but if you are playing with randos you often just get people that're messing around. Not a fan of the shooting or vehicles mechanics. Everything felt floaty/janky."
"NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. Toxic community, Bugs happen every minute, AI are stupidly OP, and the game is terribly optimized and no one plays it."
"Poor man Arma 
Imagine the kids toxic behaviour from cod but they're all full grown adult"
if you are a casual cod run and gun type of player this games not for you. To me it was slow game feels poorly optimized. I have a higher end pc and have no problems playing it just feels weird and the gun play it off. Half the time you have no idea where youre getting shot at. For people who like fast games and a lot of action stay away. I didn't play it enough to dive to deep because I got to bored after 2 games.
"Some developers really need to rethink their development skills. 

And some gamers need to reconsider their ideas about entertainment."
"game was great though ICO ruined it, and now it wont even start wit hthe new hired guns update, fucks sake devs."
I'd rather deal with cheaters than Easy AntiCheat
I only want this game for Star Wars Galactic Conquest but the Squad devs keep breaking it. I download it for free whenever its on a free weekend only for them to have broken it. I'd give my money in a heartbeat if they stopped messing with people wanting to mod the game but they seem to have a prerogative against enjoying the game in ways that aren't their vanilla experience. The day that changes I will gladly recommend this game and buy it as the gameplay is fun and I want nothing more than to play Galactic Conquest.
Meh..
"So it's almost 4 years since I did first try this game and they're just unable to fix the ""No Audio"" bug, literally no other of my almost 500 games has this problem. They also don't really give a **** about people who have that problem, just take a look at the 41 pages of peoples with the same problem in the discusions."
I typed a more detailed review but there was a problem posting it.
How are the devs able to break every mod with every update is beyond me.
"The setting ""Disable weapon model blur"" does not unblur the weapon model."
"joined a game, played for 30 minutes and all I did was lay in the dirt"
Most boring game i have ever played
"Ko da je Vulin optimizovao igricu, sram vas bilo, moram sve na very low da stavim pa mi grafika u igrici izgleda ko Roblox, umesto smoke granate vidim krupne bijele piksele! Platio sve uredno i ovako mi vracate, nije mi mater kupla racunar da bi ja na 30fps-a igro, bruka i sramota developeru, bolje nadji drugi poso Alahi mi!"
this game is so bad i cant even call a retard a retard
"This game is so badly optimized, you can't even get the menu to run smooth enough on powerful hardware to even start a game. I managed to get the settings all down to low and still ran like I was trying to play on an Intel GPU and not a high-end 4000 series nVidia GPU. What an amazing feat."
"SO FAR 17 HRS OF PLAYING,AND  CANT FIGURE IT OUT,TOO COMPLICATED,AND NOW CANT GET REFUND"
"good game, horrible updating system. waited 1 hour to steam repatch the entire game for a 2 gnupdate, then it started reinstallig. i lost it. BUT THEN it said missing download files and restarted everyrthing."
game runs like its on a toaster
was fun in the old days. now its just overdone with the combat update.
"It's alright, and even with it being 50% off at 44$ its not great. Battlefield 3 looked and played smoother and that was 13 years ago. The realism is alright I guess

   lil update after playing a little longer. This game badly suffers from big map syndrome. It has these massive maps, but unless the games are going be 200v200 its incredibly boring, the max is 50v50, IF everyone stays but most of the times the games dwindle down to 20v20 which makes the massive maps even more brutal to deal with.  After numerous games im lucky to get 3 kills. Simply because i can't find annnyone!! This game would be 10x funner and more team based if everyone was forced to be closer together.

  I joined 1 map that was modded i believe, it was like smaller islands, sorta looked like Saipan or Guadalcanal or something but that map was actually fun because the fights were condensed. you had your team around you, it was sick. It desperately needs smaller maps. Couldn't find that map again, sad face. 

  The gun movement needs to be toned down. I've been to a range and handled these weapons before! And the movement is not what i should be and I'm not even a seasoned pro!! When your guy goes to shoulder his weapon he acts like its 20lbs. or everytime you take a step while aiming your guy moves the weapon an insaaane amount. Too much, these are trained professionals, not some toddler trying to fire an M16. 

The choppers have trassshhh door guns too. For some reason the Americans have a 7.62 machine gun on the doors?  

There's nothing to grind for either, no levels, no skins, no medals, literally nothing. 

this game is caked up with ""realistic features"" that are more so over exaggerations. Reduce the maps size by 50%, focus on stability, reduce gun sway while aiming, and sway while moving and aiming. Bring faster spawning for more combat. 87 seconds to respawn is crazy especially with the size of the maps. Even if it was instant, it would still take me 3-5mins to get back to where i was.

Final take, this game is good but not over 30$"
"Four years after release, the game is still unstable and poorly-optimized.  Game crashes and then you have to rejoin the server queue from the back of the line.  Then the queue is broken and you stay at 2/3 for five minutes until you realize it's broken and you have to rejoin AGAIN from the back of the line, which has now grown to 8 people.  Updates to the lighting graphics have everything shimmering and twinkling like a Christmas tree, which detracts from the also poorly-implemented muzzle flash mechanic (because EVERYTHING is flashing...).  Audio bugs mildly deafen you nearly every match with random vehicle and HMG gunfire inside your eardrums.  People still routinely phase through the map.  Vehicle physics are clunky at the best of times.  The game is extremely slow or completely fails to put markers over teammates much of the time, which was not always a problem in the past.  Effort and money spent adding emotes would have been better spent actually fixing bugs and improving the game."
"The game is alright, but the gunplay and mechanics just feel off compared to similar shooters. Everything about the gunplay feels sluggish compared to titles like ArmA and Tarkov."
"""I HAD MY CONTROLLER PLUGGED IN NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"""
"I've been a long-time fan of ""Squad"" and truly appreciate the attention to detail and realism you've infused into the game. The commitment to creating immersive environments and strategic gameplay is impressive, making it one of the most engaging tactical shooters out there.

However, as a Muslim, I’d like to bring up a concern that I believe could improve the inclusivity and respectfulness of the game’s design. In some maps Like Fallujah, Mutah and Al Basrah, mosques are used as active flag points where battles occur, leading players to engage in combat inside or near mosques. In Islam, mosques are sacred places of worship, deeply significant to Muslims globally. Using them as combat zones, where shooting takes place in or around these revered sites, may be viewed as disrespectful to the religious and cultural values they embody.

Similarly, I’ve noticed that some maps feature churches, and I believe that all religious sites, regardless of their faith, should be treated with respect and sensitivity.

I kindly request that mosques and other religious buildings be removed from active flag zones in future updates. Perhaps they could be replaced with neutral structures like compounds or buildings, which would maintain the realism of the maps without compromising the respect for religious significance.

I understand this may not have been intentional, and I trust that the development team values feedback from players of all backgrounds. Making this adjustment could ensure the game remains inclusive and respectful to all players while continuing to deliver the top-notch tactical experience that ""Squad"" is known for."
"Game is amazing, fun, and most probably the best game in its genre. However, the community is as awful as it can be, racism is rampant with the N word being thrown almost every game, along with the occasional IsIs music and the ""Allah w akbar"" callouts; even if they're not insurgents. Even some bullying occurs, one guy I found in a few lobbies had an obvious lisp, and other players would start mimicking him. Gotta respect the guy for ignoring them though.

The fact that it's a game where you have to communicate and do what your SL tells you to do (otherwise you will be kicked from the squad) is both a good and a bad thing. I like the fact that you need to communicate, but hate the fact the people you're communicating with are most probably just a bunch of edgy teens.

Again, I love the game, hate the community.
I recommend you buy it if you have friends to play with, otherwise, stay away. In my case, I don't have friends to play this game with, so it's thumb down."
"My PC far exceeds the recommended specs, yet I'm stuck at only 40 frames. This game seriously needs performance improvements!"
community is ass. ruins the entire game.
"Hardest game i have ever tried.
it needs for real friends not by random"
I have over 1100 hours in this game. I am so disappointed that they ruined the shooting mechanics in the game.  since the updates I have completely stopped playing.  I tired once to come back played about 15 mins but the mechanics are so bad its unplayable.
"WE NEED OPTİMİZATİON!!!!   MAJOR SQUAD V9.0 UPDATE ONLY FOR OPTİMİZATİON, PLS OFFWORLD PLS"
"If I could get a refund for the game I would. I purchased the game because it was a nice, coordination based game with transferable aiming skills. they changed the aiming and I didn't know about it till after my purchase. I really tried to love it but damn is the aiming damn near impossible to get used to. I play tarkov, ready or not, hell let loose, and a bunch of other games in that vein... skills from those games do not transfer over.  Save your money if you play other shooters. if this is going to be your career shooter have at it."
make sure you got a nice pc
"Community for this game is terrible. IT REQUIRES COMMUNICATION however players rarely want to play as a team. 
Too many people will pick US Marines but have NO IDEA HOW TO PLAY ARMOUR. There is no penalty for going lone wolf besides screwing over your team."
"This game is not bad, some aspects are greatly done, especially concerning realism. But it's kinda janky and boring sometimes. I don't mind about walking too much to where the action is, but the maps can look freaking awful sometimes and absolutely devoid of life. It just can't convince me enough, I pass."
Melle
Too little frames and too many game breaking bugs. It gets worse each update.
WHY IS THE MENU MUSIC NOT AFFECTED BY THE MUSIC VOLUME OPTION IN THE SETTINGS I HAVE BEEN DEAFENED BY THIS TRASH WHILST TRYING TO FIND THE MUTE BUTTON
the game keeps crashing and doesn't tell me why
"The recent changes to infantry play have made the game unfun. I don't find it ""tactical"" to sit in corners the whole game. Squad had a great game with good mechanics and they ruined it and now nobody wants to play."
"I used to play Project Reality so I grabbed this a few years ago. Played a little but the game was nowhere near finished and bare of content so decided to come back some other time.

Fast forward to now where I open this abomination and experience the lag of all lag in the menu. It appears despite being at it for years, the cretinous bunch at  'Offworld Franchise' who produce this game cannot (are unwilling to) optimise it. For the record, I'm running a Ryzen 5600x and an RTX 3070 (drivers up to date) and this game is COMPLETELY unplayable. 

Considering paying money for this scam product? Run like hell because unless you have a very niche, singlecore CPU, you can't play it."
"its simply not fun, not at all."
Shit is ass do not buy unless you want to waste 50 bucks.
the game runs shit in cold water and the devs dont seem to give much of a fck
"Meh, I rather play Minecraft w/ world war mod instead"
ICO is just fucking ass this game is unplayable
"trying to rebind the emote button so i don't accidentally press it during combat, bind it to my left mouse click and now I can't click any menu in game and I'm unable to change the setting because my character is just constantly waving. 

Exciting gameplay 10/10
Visual design 10/10
Audio design 10/10
Not having needless fortnite emotes 0/10"
trash i used to love squad havent played in awhile they did some updates now you the game is unplayable. cant  even hold a gun straight even though the are trained to hold weapons
my wife left me
"I love the gameplay, but I simply cannot recommend this game due to the terrible optimization and performance issues it has, even on lowest settings with my legion 5 gaming laptop that cost me $1200 I can't hit a stable 60fps, and aiming with scopes or engaging in any kind of firefight quickly drops that by almost half.

If you wan't to play this game make sure you have a top of the line desktop pc, and that might even not be enough."
"The game was excellent pre ICO but the shooting mechanics are so bad now that it feels like a punishment.

Other changes in the ICO are good, overall, but I can no longer recommend this game as a good and realistic military simulation because of the shooting itself. If this changes, sure, there's nothing like Squad... But be wary of the headache and suffering if you play right now."
no sex
"if you support abstinence, then this is the game for you! Edit: The closer to realism they get, the worse this game gets. It was a good balanced combination between realism vs enjoyability, but they have turned away from enjoyable game-play to appease the virgins of the community."
"I initially couldn't get over how bad the graphics look, but decided to give it another shot and really wanted to get into it. Unfortunately it also seems to be horribly optimised, so despite looking like a ten year old game, even on modern hardware it struggles to run smoothly. The drastic FPS drops at key moments just make it unplayable."
"I used to love this game and played it when I had the time; coming back to it years later I cannot, however, in good conscience recommend it.
Any company changing their privacy policy to the effect of ""we'll collect your <everything> and sell it to Google, Microsoft, and whoever else we damn well please"" without letting me opt out is not worth supporting."
Uses easy anitcheat
"Before the ICO update, game was good. Formerly a Battlefield player and the combat was considerably slower back then, but well balanced where you good push offensively with good success. The new update ruined the game. It was already slow but now it basically encourages staying still and hiding in bushes. Game sucks. Do yourself a favor and refund if you still can but DEFINITELY do not buy this garbage

EDIT: Also, notice how the recently good reviews for this game come from players with very few hours of gameplay. While a lot of the negative reviews come from those with substantially more gameplay. i.e. a lot of the positive reviews don't have the playtime to accurately comment on why this game is so bad now."
"How much do i like fps? life time? as of this review? surely nearing 20,000hrs.  

  im talkin. Doom,  duke nukem, wolfenstien,  im saying Duckhunt, Decent, Half-life's, counter-strike 1.6, CS:Source, TFC,  & Natural selection !   All them Black ops,  modern warfares, unreal tourny, Quakes, PUBG,  Fallouts,  ghost recons, metal gear solids.

I will not play Squad."
"Ah Yes, This is That Game!
The only mil-sim game where you will reach the peak of toxicity, with egoistic game admins and terrible game physics. The only thing you need to know before starting the game is that this game is full of toxics and you will never enjoy playing this game. You can make better use of your money."
"I cannot, after 700+ hours in this game, recommend this game. It's full of baby admins who will ban you if you stand up for yourself against what they determine as ""their definition of war."" if you adhere to the very specific rules of the server you will still get banned because the server admins friends have ""claim on a vehicle."" 

Are you too good at finding radios? banned for ghostin(SOF server)
Are you taking a vehicle that you have claim for but the other squad that ""died first"" is standing around not taking the vic? banned for toxicity.

it's just too much negativity from the server admins to even play this game because they protect their own and OWI doesn't do anything about it. If you've ever reported someone in a game like league of legends you are told if an action is taken against them, OWI does the opposite and doesn't tell you because they don't care.

Do yourself a favor and do not support this game and give it the deserved death because the admins are garbage and OWI doesn't care about their own game. The structure of the game is counter to any form of modern administrative know how and they don't police abusive server admins anyway so it's not even worth playing.

Really solid game potential but lacks in support because of OWI."
"This game is awesome however there are big issues holding this game back. One being its poorly optimized as commented in other reviews. Second is the infantry update. I enjoy the new features it has added to Squad such as the picture in picture scopes and the added suppression. The negatives far outweigh the positives in my opinion 

My main issue is the absurd amount of time it takes to steady your weapon. I understand the need to be ""realistic"" however taking 3-5 business days to ""steady"" my iron sight... it is incredibly excessive. Speaking from experience as current military it takes approximately a second to steady my scope even under stress. Its borderline silly and makes the game frustrating to play as you feel like you are not in control of your character. 

Second complaint is the recoil. I have experience shooting M4's M249s and the M240. Shooting the M4 in game, feels like shooting a 308. Even at close range. Again I understand trying to encourage the player to take his time to take his shot and reward those who are patient but I feel it is completely unrealistic. It further adds to the frustration and feeling that a close quarter gun fight is RNG, flip of the coin luck whether you win or lose that firefight. 

These two aspects of the game I feel are extremely exaggerated and would benefit the game if it were toned down a hair. Remember these are trained soldiers behind the guns of these factions, It should feel like it."
"Toxic player base, just like Squad 44.

Now show me that you aren't in the comments."
"The whole concept behind the game is really very good and I think it makes for a really enjoyable experience if you can get it running properly.

I wouldn't really be able to tell you from my own experience since the game is horribly optimized. I have a pretty decent gear that runs all titles without any significant issues, but I couldn't get this thing to run on more than 40 FPS whatever tweak or update I did. Looking around was choppy and felt like my character was underwater due to a barely noticeable mouse lag. With that, I just couldn't get into the experience as I'd wanted to.

Finally, the game stopped loading completely after I installed the latest graphics driver. I even trier rerolling it to no avail. In summary, I spent more time tinkering with the settings trying to get this thing to run properly than actually playing it. Looking for a solution I noticed I was not the only one as various forums and blogs are filled with people having issues with running Squad.

If you manage to run it without any of the issues I (and many others) experienced, it should make for a pretty rewarding experience. Unfortunately, there's a decent chance you won't be as lucky."
nah no good
Serious issue. The gunplay feels good in most scenarios. People are funny. The game looks good to. But there is no inflation mechanic. every intense moment is ruined by the fact that my BFFF can't inflate me
horribly optimized.
Learned hit registration was client side and this game has crap spaghetti code for hit detection and servers... makes for a bad FPS unfortunately
You play as an uneducated sixteen year old that never touched a weapon.
Crazy bad optimized game. I don't have the best system but it is above recommended specs and I have 40-50 fps and it drops here and there down to 20 on the lowest settings possible. If you look into some discussions here on steam and other forums you will find that I am by far not the only one and people with very good systems can have problems beyond playability. Sad because the gunplay is the most satisfying one I've ever seen
They should make the game run better. big geh
"This is a great game, but the community is completely awful. If you get banned from a server because you had a disagreement with a full on neck beard admin, there's a good chance you'll be automatically banned from all other servers. If this has happened to you, make sure you report this behavior to the better business bureau for breach of contract."
"As of right now, I can't say I've enjoyed this at all. I've been going between this and Hell Let Loose, and Hell Let Loose is infinitely more fun and rewarding than Squad. I played the game with an understanding of the slower pace and more punishing game mechanics, I developed a understanding of how matches flow, but I have to say I never feel rewarded for my additional patience and focus. 
In Squad, I wouldn't mind the lack of an IFF system so much apart from looking at the map and pointing at someone at 10 meters away, if it wasn't so chaotic and scattered. Not to mention when you do acquire a target, you cannot range-find, and it's a 2 shot kill with the DMRs, so Marksman feels empty as hell, and Sniper does especially due to there being no spotter like in HLL.
I can't relay information all that well and accurately because it's rare that a marksman is a FTL, thus you can't mark a damn thing, so not only is the shooting not fun but there's no passive recon role for you either. If I wanted a 2 shot sniper, I'd rather just go and play battlefield, it feels arcade-like as hell, especially when HLL is 1 shot kill.
Overall, the only thing that ever makes me want to come back to it is that it's modern, but I will take HLL every day of the week, and I wouldn't really care if I never played this again. Sure, the game has its moments, mainly due to the community, but overall, the additional patience and focus required to play this game isn't rewarded very much at all, and I personally wouldn't play this all day like I would Hell Let Loose.
Also, as someone who plays tanks more than anything else, the game-play doesn't feel great for AFVs either, it doesn't feel all that fun, but it's a thrill in HLL, so that's all I have to say."
crashes a lot and if you do not load in quickly you will get timed out
This game stinks

"One of the main thing about the game, is the optimisation. This game has the worst optimisation and game itself is CPU based. Does not matter game is good or unique whatever. If it is not playable, so it is trash. I am quitting unfortunately my fav game (for some time) from today until they fix these issues (they wont).  
(If you you dont have latest technology in your pc just dont buy this game)"
This game somehow manged to be way worse optimized then it was a year ago. My PC is better than what is recommended and it struggles to hit 50 FPS at the lowest settings when a year ago it was easily able to surpass 100 FPS.
"Audio input device keeps on resetting, I have to select every time I play this game. Can't play because of this bug. :steamthumbsdown:"
community is just russians and its all disorganized
"Not only you need a Nasa computer to play this one, keep in mind you most likely will barely get into any close range combat since this game is a run and die simulator. Also, it is very funny to see how my trained soldier needs 10 mins to adjust his aim in order to take a shot, shooting in this game is very broken too. Hate to admit it but the game failed my expectations."
No possibilty to create a group to play with your friends? lol
fucking impossible
"Used to be a good game, now it's not."
"Lets see Toxic SL's in that are friends with or are moderators of Servers ruin the game. 

Got kicked form a server for just saying ""follow me I'm the closest element to the enemy"" as we were attacking the enemy base SO I re joined the server and squad the SL said ""watch this"" and banned me for 7 days. 

Went to the Servers discord ""Elite Gaming Corps"" [ECG] as they said I could appeal the ban, The Admin on their discord ""[EGC] Sleepy"" told me to kick rocks we don't have anyone by that name and the appeal went nowhere....     

So i would not recommend playing this game SL's and Moderators can just ban you for for speaking against their people. Its the worst type of game that only encourages Toxic admin that have full power to not let you play the game."
The game mechanics are super sluggish and make you feel like you are running on a treadmill and shooting a nerf gun.
"Hell Let Loose with modern weapons...
Battlefield with more realism...
Run around slowly through a wheat field looking for enemies for 30 mins then get shot in the head...
Im a tarkov player, and this didn't scratch the gun realism or the adrenaline punch.
Refunded"
Played this up and down over the years. But the developers have no interest in keeping the game optimized and running reliably.
"Unless you have a NASA super computer you can not play the game. Game play is great, but with dips, stutters, and general inconsistent frame rates its a not fun experience."
nah
"Can get pretty boring, its fun when it works, Mic is recommend or you might get kicked!!!!! Poorly optimized!!!!!!!


Also please do not buy this from the Steam store directly thank you, their monopoly on PC gaming is not good for the consumer!!!!!! They heavily censor people in the forums, you can't speak freely out of fear of being banned, I have had a 1 year community ban because of stupid silly bans, they accumulate, and eventually land you a community ban!!!! If you support Steam, you support such censorship!!!"
"game is fucking gay as hell 

literally balances asymmetric warfare to the point the irregulars and insurgents are the best factions in the game

squeakers and cod players go to squad when they get bored of fuckin cod and battlefield

actual dog shit"

"Takes a very long time to get to the combat, especially with no vehicle, only for you to get clipped 5 seconds upon entering the battlefield having to spend 10 more minutes running back to the combat"
to much russians
"if you like to spawn in, run a for a few minutes, and get 1 shot from some random guy 2k miles away with a scope. Then this game is for you. The previews are all for cinematic purposes. In reality the moment you peak ANY corner you are shot. Lay down and take it slow in some high grass. HA FUNNY. Youll be sniped or some random will run up and kill you before his head even pops over the hill. Feel like suppressing fire? nope youll get 10 shots off and get picked off instantly. The only good thing about this is the experience with your squad, but other than that its no fun at all. just another run and die simulator"

"Honestly pretty bad. Save your money.

To many glitches!

(1) In a tank? After shooting once you can not shoot again, have you leave the vehicle to reload about 50% of the time very annoying especially in combat.
(2) In a tank? Oh hit a tiny bush? Or little lip of the map? Bang! You flipped over or lost all momentum and got launched.
(3) Most maps are just garbage.
(4) Can't really play solo, no communication of command chat most servers.
(5) Ran 1-5 feet? You're character is an asthmatic and can't seem to aim properly.
(6) Reload bug with main weapon is annoying.
List goes on, recent update is not bad, global escalation is the only server you should play honestly."
The game was so good prior to the infantry combat overhaul. Now your soldier has arms like wet noodles and hes never handled a rifle before.. :/  some of the worst weapon handling of any game now. kind of unfortunate.
"Worst ""Realistic"" game ive ever played. The shooting mechanics make no sense. Its like the developer only watched videos on CNN about how weapons work and used that to make the game. Hope i can get a refund, because i wouldn't get the game if they payed me to play it."
The changes to the aiming system feel terrible. If you touch the sprint key it will take 7-10 business days for you to stop wheezing like an asthmatic in a dust cloud while your gun wobbles back and forth like you have pool noodles where your bones should be. I don't think this change has had the intended effect on squad dynamics as people still go lone wolf and refuse to communicate but now every gun fight feels like RNG instead of a question of gun skill or positioning. The group dynamics and game experience when your squad is working together is still some of the best in gaming but the actual play feels so much worse.
", because you are very unlikely to do so"
bad
"It used to be pretty fun game before. Now they have changed the ads rendering and it's pretty much unplayable. In addition to that, they managed to make it even more unoptimised and laggy than it used to be."
crashed my pc while on loading screen
"Game is cool and has tons of potential, only if people weren't so dumb. One thing is having fun on spawn and another thing is being a clown on the battlefield on a server marked as focused/milsim. Commanders not leading their team, sometimes not even having a mic, is just as common as people not following orders or even playing with their squad."
Games fuckin trash and full of fags
toxic
"Poorly optimised, big fps drop. Unplayable"
trash game
its not good game
"Game use to be fun. Current state just makes no sense. Its the slowest animations I have ever seen. It is not even a running sim, its a walking sim.  The mods make it fun but as a base game, it has gone from one of my favorites to worse than battlefield. recoil makes no sense. 9mm is staring at the sky after 2 shots, can't even spray a target point blank. Devs have no idea what realism is, which if I am not mistaken, is what the game took pride in early on. If you want realism, this is not the game for you. If you still get it, download the mods. It fixes some of the problems, not all of them."
"This whole game feels like it used to on a free weekend. Fights are much longer now, yea. Soldiers are shaking more then someone going through withdrawals. Logis are avoided by most players. Not a fan anymore. Used to be my top game."
"They put so much effort into depicting real combat that the end result feels extremely over-exaggerated, turning the entire experience into something frustrating and dull, with memorable occurrences happening very rarely."
Sometimes more realistic isn't better. Spend 20-30 minutes walking or riding to a location just to take a bullet from nowhere. Repeat the process. Realistic? yeah... Fun? No!
"The community in most of the servers is full of the biggest pro airsoft ""i couldve joined the military but i'd punch someone"" community that is not friendly to any new players despite server claims in their titles. There are lots of power hungry people that get a smidge of authority and be complete pretentious a-holes all the time, yet ban/kick people that argue back. I got ran over by a tank and tk'd by two goobers that were close to the server owner in one server and team-killing is okay but when i call them r*tards for running over people with a tank, their ego and feelings get extremely hurt and they banned me for offensive chat. i figured there would be people with actual personalities that want to hop on and have some fun because the game looks more arcade-y than arma but that doesn't seem to be the case in the 2 hours and around 5 servers that i hopped into. 

TL:DR most of the people that play this game don't play for fun and aren't friendly to new people. they must be fun at parties and have great social skills outside their basement."
Bunch of kids that have no idea what they doing. Your teammates always pop you or your buddy cause they don't know how to P.I.D uniforms and weapon systems. No one in the game plays the way it should be. Everyone thinks it's battlefield and run around with their heads up their ass. No one knows shit about combat when it comes to this game. It's ridiculous
"Disappointing ""Realism"" Game, Overpriced. Most hours are from game being idle in the background."
"Racism,Sexim,Putinism,Zeleniskism,Trumpizm,Americanizm,Natoizm,Bricsizm."
i have no idea why i got this fucking trash game
Let's be honest battlefield is still better.
"Squad has been out for eight years and it still has the same audio bugs and so many other problems that it has had since early access. The dev team don't seem to care about the title. Half of the new content they release is just mods that purchase (probably for a pittance) and it takes forever for them to add it into the game. In spite of much I've played Squad I can't recommend it to anyone because it's too frustrating to play most of the time. Very often I'll spend half an hour in a queue to join a server and I'll have to quit because I didn't realize that my headset wasn't on and, despite the fact that you can change your audio output device in the in-game settings, that part of the menu has never actually worked. If you change outputs mid game (like if you accidentally unplug your headset or it dies) Squad will stop outputting to it and if might even crash. The only way to fix this is to restart your game and queue up again. This has been an issue since early access and it's weird that we still have problems like this in a game that is so focused on communication. This is just one of the game-breaking bugs that has been present since launch. Also, an aside, a couple years ago OWI, the developers, sold out to Tencent (The CCP) and they are trying to turn this game into a microtransaction filled pile. They have no ethics and have been to known to fire employees over having the ""wrong"" view. They fired an employee for stating anti-CCP views on social media shortly before they got their investment from Tencent. We all just assumed that was their new glorious leaders doing."
This game gave me aids
"Summary_ 
At it's core, in a server that isn't full of nit-wits, it can be a fun example of large scale mil-sim but it's plagued with poor performance and questionable design decisions which disrupt the flow of gameplay.

Design_
A large scale tactical game, sitting inbetween Battlefield and Arma 3, leaning towards the latter, unfortunately it seems to have inherited some of the jank from that as well with vehicle handling, movement systems and just how sluggish everything feels, I can usually excuse the slow pace as it it's designed towards a more methodical play-style, however the developers have consistently been making it worse over time, particularly highlighted with the Infantry Combat Overhaul which strives for realism but just makes infantry a chore. It attempts to execute a realistic feel for things but fails to create an identity for itself as it forgets at it's core that it is a game and is supposed to be enjoyed.

Maps are relatively uninteresting, feeling like plastic sandboxes with a veneer of theme. again reminicent of early arma games.

Technology_
It's plagued with the usual mid-life UE4 game troubles, shader & traversal stutter, some really awful Temporal anti-aliasing, which is somehow not remedied with DLSS, suggesting their art doesn't lend itself to it, distracting Ambient Occlusion artifacts, almost identical to that of Ground Branch (which coincidentally is on the same engine branch). Frame-rate dips into the high 30s considerably on high-end hardware, particularly while using PIP scopes, which was a strange late addition, given the pre-existing performance issues."
"I've enjoyed SQUAD when I've had the itch for it but after ICO, I find myself uninstalling this game time and time again.

ICO was meant to be an overhaul to the infantry mechanics to make things more ""realistic"" and to encourage cooperation between players and reduce the whole ""lone wolf"" mentality that was initially in SQUAD. Problem is they've over compensated, and now the weapon sway makes combat feel absolutely frustrating more than it is enjoyable. ICO is dog ass and until they update ICO again to adjust the sway values I'm not reinstalling this game. Arma 3 has more better gunplay then this update and that's saying something for how absolutely jank that game is."
"Got a new PC, installed Squad and now the game is stuck in offline mode. Discord mods/support don't help and just lock your threads, steam community is no help. Game support is literally ZERO.  fuck OWI."
"Its painful to write this because i really want to write something positive and reccomend to friends.... but i can't.   To start with the good,  i think the overall war aesthetic with the different factions, mod support, overall gameplay of pushing objectives instead of running for kills is definitely there. I enjoy playing this waking up in the mornings by doing Logi runs to start, and then get into combat later, there definitely is a pull to play this game and have enjoyed some experiences along the way. Plus there is no push to pay Microtransactions which is nice too. And lastly i really enjoy the maps!                                  Now time for the bad. There are more bugs in the game than an old abandoned warehouse. You can't shoot through open holes even when the barrel is sticking through the hole in the wall and theres plenty of space. I had to download a VPN just to stay in a lobby for more than 5 minutes at a time because of Server Closed Connection error. No VPN= no gameplay, i see it happen to everyone i play with. Performance wise isn't terrible but definitely needs a touch up lag wise and de sync wise. You get stuck on random objects all the time like trees or even rocks. There's quite a bit more.    I want to see the game improve, but until i can see positive action, i cannot reccomend the game, i only say all this with respect and the desire to see the game get better."
Asking me to write a whole ass review just to give a game a thumbs down is asinine.
crashed my game after i set defaults graphics settings
I’d like  by to refund this game

"Fat neck beards with no life larp either as Super commandos or wanna be jihadist, 10/10 they never fired a gun irl."

"60 hours in and still have no idea what i'm doing.

I want to enter a tank. I get kicked out or can't enter at all.
I want to play with tanks and stuff. Nope. 
Teammates helps out and pick me up with truck? Nope, get run over.
I want to play specific role. Nope, someone else picked that.
There are zombies server, which is cool idea. No one plays it.
Modded servers, great. Hard to find them.

I get it that the game is realistic and all but really limiting to me. 60 hours in and i still haven't played with a tank for example. 90% of the teammates i had would just f with me.
I bet it's great game, just not for everyone."
"I don't understand the plot of this game.By the way, this game lacks LGBT representation, has few Black characters, and insufficient diversity among women, which is why I gave it a negative review."
worst aiming system EVER. even if your just standing there its like you have noodle arms
"ICO is horrible, weapons handling is awful."
"-Very poor optimization

-Absurd weapon sway/recoil control

-Suppression system is wildly untuned

-Aim point seems to be from chest level rather than head level, making seemingly “clear” shots hit geometry

-Unless facing off against Irregulars or Insurgents, nearly impossible to identify enemies

-Server-hop and roll the dice, match quality is atrocious across the board

-Overwhelming majority of “community” who stayed after the ICO Update are vile and toxic; an astonishing amount of lackadaisical immaturity and stolen valor keyboard warriors who think their knowledge of a game makes them veterans. Laughable."
bad performance
Game is fun but no one new wants to learn how to play the game right and 80% of the time i end up with teams that dont secure points and just play like it's cod and push from one direction
It's a little bit difficult to see enemies... and alot of the time you'll end up killing friendlies
"stupid game, i hate you so much off world, some servers dumb asf and you're not even making sure of that"
Not my cup of biscuit.
"I only have close to 19 hours in the game so I only scratched the surface of the game but from what I experienced until now I would not recommend the game due to the following reasons:

- Movement, shooting, driving... basically everything has some jank to it
- Hitboxes of structures can be weird and not what they should be
- Insane levels of suppression
- Gunplay just feels terrible"
Bunch of military reject and dishonorable discharges that have nothing better to do than bully each other.
very cool
"Squad has huge potential, but its $50 price tag is too high. This is a game that feels like it is in late alpha stage. The bugs are numerous, and the game itself feels unpolished and unfinished. I do usually have fun on this game, but I would only recommend buying it on a sale. Once it is more polished it will be a 10/10"
Some of the worst devs ever.
terrible ui not very well optimized
nah
honestly this game just isnt for me
"Still randomly crashes after 4 years. One second you're playing on a full server, the next half the server disappears, just like your childhood hopes and dreams (just faster)!"
"Game is not playable at all.

Server Browser and ""Find A Match"" do not work on this game. Haven't been able to play for months now. You literally can only play the tutorials. Game is completely useless now."
laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag
Was good at one point in time
"FOV is tied to resolution/aspect ratio which means triple screen users like myself cannot play whatsoever. 120 fov looks more like 30. Ridiculous oversight in 2024, until this game becomes playable, im reviewing negatively as they have not considered anyone who uses more than 1 screen."
"Toxic community and shitty servers, everyone acts braindead and overly rude.

edit: played some more, game is just boring, previous problems still stand"
very slow and bugs
"i dont like to be forced to talk to people exp  when they take this game too srsly,  im just playing the game not tryn learn it or be great at it. i just wanna have fun solo but in multiplayer"
"Returned after a year away to check out the new gunplay mechanics. Feels unplayable now, takes 4 working days to ADS and when you eventually get there, the sight shakes like a geriatric granny. No hate but it feels like an L for me. At least I got my moneys worth before the update I guess."

"I have tried and tried and tried. I saw all the reviews when ICO first dropped and I was adamant I was going to give it a good honest go. I felt like this game was thriving, especially in the Oceania servers. My mates and I had some of the best gaming experiences we've ever had playing pre-ICO squad going all the way back to the early alpha versions 2015/2016 when there weren't even vehicles in the game yet.
I love this game, and I want to still love this game, but I can't help but be continually frustrated and then disappointing with the ICO game play man... It just ruins the experience for me. And clearly has ruined it for a lot of people.

All good things come to an end I suppose, but It felt like Squad had just lifted off. And it could've gotten so much better. Once the game came out of Beta in 2020 and 1.0 was live it felt like it was really starting to take off. There were even competitive games that we played in. And it felt good that I could recognise players from years ago that were still here supporting the game.

However I feel as though for me, (maybe some other people feel the same but ultimately I can only speak for myself) it has been very difficult to adapt to the play style. The only reason I still play is to join the modded servers that take it back to as close as it can be to pre-ICO, and when they're empty, I don't even bother anymore."
The game has turned into nothing but locked Squads and SLs kicking people from Squads. The recoil and ads speed that can be timed with a calendar have made this game feel like im always playing drunk. Maybe one day they will revert back to its original glory.
"Parkinsons + FPS = Squad

Dogsh@t, not worth 50 Euro. Your experience is wholy based on who you play with and since update 7 its been downspiraling into bullsh@t. No teamwork, no strategies.... exactly what the game is based on and selling you. First 300 hours you wont know what you are doing or where you are getting shot at unless you have someone to guide you like in the past with the veterans leading the way for the Newbies. Now its the blind leading the blind kind of senario. OWI prioritises new players over veterans, cant sell the game twice, ofcouse they would if they could.

Also, if your computer aint top notch... dont expect more than 12 fps and 1 if artillery is on its way, even if you play on lowest settings.

Dont expect much from OWI either, promising new content and making roadmaps only to scrap them and sell you skins and emotes. Whats next? Battlepass? Just fix the game...

Was the best game out there, i play for the nostalgia it gives me, but holy sh@t  did OWI destroy the game."
worst game ever
Some how the devs went backwards they had a good game then messed it up. I enjoyed playing this game at one point but it seem just like bigger company they cant help but break good games.
Its a combination of the graphics and movement of counter strike the shooting of call of duty and maps of Battlefield. I paid 30USD and I think that was to much.
Just play the mods. The game developers made the soldiers have the aim of inflatable tube dancers from a car dealership. Sure the majority of reviews are positive but those people are using mods. ICO needs to go
"Not sure what happen to this game, but it went from gold to shit. 330 hours in the game and they somehow made visibility worse, the gunplay unrealistic and stupid, might as well remove the stamina bar, it does nothing but a 2 second sprint for a 2 minute recovering timer, you can't see ANYTHING when you're being ""suppressed"", which just makes gunfights absolutely horseshit. For the veteran players out there, I feel bad for what the devs did to you. They don't care and will never care for you. They will try to simulate something so damn hard that it will absolutely ruin the entire experience for you. I understand why OperatorDrewski stopped playing this game."

You trust the name tag, and hold fire. You don't see a name tag, you fire, and it's a friendly. They worked perfectly before all the DLSS blurry bullshit was added."
"I never leave reviews... this is my first review. 

This game is a complete piece of horse____.

This game used to be the best thing ever but these updates to make it more realistic completely killed the game for me. I pull more hairs trying to get my character to actually fire his weapon than anything else. 

DO NOT BUY... this is from a former hardcore fan."
"Have 800+ hrs into the game, was fun at start, ICO was great but in the last few weeks/months the game is broken beyond repair, I do not know how they roll out updates that break the game even more with each rollout.

Bugs of all kinds, visual, sound, gamebreaking bugs like glitchy respawns, invicible tanks, broken vehics that do not reaload, broken guns, broken anti tank that does not reload, glitchy ragdolls, helis being dead in the sky, crashes, etc etc. Really dissapointed, I gave it time for the devs to fix, but enough time wasted for a broken game."
This game is great but the community completely ruins it. Everyone is completely toxic and horrible. You should honestly just play arma
buggy and unpolished. Shouldnt cost as much as it did
add swedish military
"This game was once the best semi-realistic shooter on the market. Then OWI decided to burn it all down. From the most controversial change, ""Infantry Combat Overhaul"", to long standing technical bugs (grass not rendering at distance, vehicles vibrating, players' bodies glitching through walls, etc.), and a not so new problem I am encountering again; I can't even select an audio output device. This was an issue when I first downloaded Squad, SEVEN YEARS AGO. 

TLDR: Lazy developers are not fixing issues reported by the community for years and consistently push out fixes based on whims."
you will not be able to run this game
gunplay feels trash
"Not really a good game, is nearly impossible to find a decent server. Usually the commanders are idiots along with the rest of the team. The graphics arent that great for 2024. Its nearly impossible to tell friend from foe so you get team killed over and over. Then you have to wait forever to spawn 5 mins worth of running from where you were at. Arma or Hell Let Loose are much better in my opinion. Really cant recommend for full price, maybe for a steep discount it could be worth a try"
"Not really beginner friendly, i dont know if im just unlucky with the servers i joined. but the moment i joined, the voice chat was just a shouting match between what feels like everyone in the server. i die at some point, so i respawn as i take a long walk back to join my squad, all the way i hear squad lead and other members arguing and yelling. after 10 mins of walking i finally get back to the point where squad was telling everyone to go to, i turn a corner and first person i ever see since the 10 mins ive been walking is my teamate named DutchDave, whom i get startled by because his unifrom looked differently colored to me so i shoot him. it dosent kill him but ofcs apologize. he however proceeds to still call me a Fucking idiot, to which i tell him to calm down and that im new to the game and didnt hear him announce himself, and i guess that hurt his fragile af ego and his very mature response is ofcs to unload his whole mag into me whilst insulting me the entire time, then he drags my body and keeps insulting me and that dosent stop until he is finally killed by an enemy. after that its more shouting and insulting between everyone feels like im playing fucking COD from XBOX era instead of a tactical shooter. 

all this happened in the first game that i joined. and im sorry but despite it looking like complexly fun game where communication is vital, i absolutely do not want to be part of the communication when so far from what ive experienced has been just immature self righteous pricks that will not only kill you and insult the fuck out of u for ur inexperience, they will also be shouting over each other as if whoever can reach the highest decibels is gonna be crowned the emperor of all mankind. 

im sure that what ive experienced is probably not what the average experience for a beginner is like, and i still want to have faith that most people are friendly. but from my experience it completely killed any sort of need or want to play this game again anytime soon."
"Game's dead already. got thrown into a server with myself and one other gamer, screwed around until I died of fall damage.

I also couldn't get the game working in 4k, not without AMD FSR enabled. Without FSR it doesn't seem to fit the screen properly."
"I used to like this game and loved playing it all-day-long on the weekends but, the infantry overhaul ruined the game. You can barely aim your weapon and for some reason it's harder to spot OPFOR. This game is jank now. I do not recommend this game to anyone anymore. The Devs screwed up big time, they need to fix this game."
"ICO update ruined this game.  They wanted to ""slow down"" firefights and get rid of ""lone wolfing"", but they accomplished that by destroying gun play and punishing infantry.  .50cal round flew within 50m of you? Enjoy being legally blind with suppression for 30 seconds!  Enemy player cannot hit a shot from 25m away? Forget trying to shoot back, your screen is aimpunched from every single bullet that even comes near you and you can't fight back!  Hear enemy armor rolling down the road towards you? Well pull out your HAT and wait 2 minutes for your weapon sway to go away!

The game felt great before.  Good players crushed bad players.  Now every soldier has Parkinson's and has also never shot a rifle in their life.

But don't worry, OWI is working on some more WACKY and FUN emotes and weapon skins!"
Badly optimized game
"so baaaaad, pinoy faction needed"
Used to be such a good game. Completely ruined by the ICO update. Not to mention most people suck at being SL's and teammates rarely talk anymore... Uninstalled. Don't recommend buying. There are better games out there.
Very fun game would not recommend at the moment because of the removal of the global escalation mod which made the game where it should have been save your money unless you wouldn't mind playing on the regular boring servers with shit mechanics!
1/10. By far the worst game I have purchased on steam. Dont buy this game!
Not enough slide cancelling and exo jumps
Give me my reflex back!!! and Community ban list is heinous and L. I'd rather a bot over chuddly meeting his ban quota. Good community
game is just shit now
Star Wars mod still broken.
"With just under 1k hours in Squad, most of that coming from around 2020-2021, I've not been up to date with anything Squad related since, so maybe this game isn't meant for players like me anymore but here is my review, based upon just how much time I spent on this game, learning it deeply and playing at a level where I was comfortable, to playing it recently:

I recently reinstalled to play with a friend, and I was not prepared for the shock that I have come to learn is the 'ICO' update. 

Now I totally understand that I've not been up to date with it, and from what I used to be, I am a filthy casual in comparison to what I used to be... but the gun play in this game feels as if you gave a toddler a gun whilst balancing on a water bed. The AMOUNT of sway that a ""soldier"" has to his gun even after moving barely 30% of the screen is incredible. I do not fully understand why it feels like the noodle arms feels like it has been turned up to 110%, nor the scopes being at all possible to look down and accurately hit something when it feels like my character is holding a gun too big for him to hold.

Squad is a team game, I totally get that, and I was under the impression that it already was before this ICO update. Excellent players were able to turn the tides, but excellent tactics would trump those players. Positioning > Aim, right? I just feel as if this update just completely takes away from player skill and prefers players to just spam left click at the sight of any enemy rather than take precise slow shots. They can't fire back if their suppressed screen is shaking about.

I didn't last longer than a full game as it was just straight up: Not fun. Ultimately that is what it has come down to. It's not fun to sit there waiting for weapon sway to calm before I can even begin taking shots at someone. It's not fun to lose a hipfire ""50/50"" because they shot first (and missed), but because I'm suppressed I have to adjust -like hell- for my weapon swaying off to the side. I'm already at a disadvantage cause they shot first, and yet I'm punished more because they can't kill me within the first 1-2 bullets.

It is just a shame, I loved what Squad was, not what it is now. Don't think I'll ever install it again with how it plays now. it is still king for teamwork/team play and overall using communication to beat the enemy team, but in terms of gun play, that for me is completely ruined and gone."
Bugged unoptimased arma clone
Would say bad game has no sex but im always getting but fucked any way so its just a bad game
i hate my life
"your either smacking everybody, or your getting destroyed by somebody that you cant see, there's no in between.  Also it should not take a trained solider a minute to aim after running for 30 seconds, it makes sense for your aim to be a bit worse, but it feels really overdone."
"This game is a laggy mess. They need to optimize this game. If you have medium tier hardware, do not buy."
"Terrible for the modding community. Two of the best mods have been removed forever for whatever reason. Global escalation, and galactic contention were amazing reasons to buy this game."
Runs like shit
boring
"The Removal of GE mod killed the game. Community should know, that publishers from offworld interactive realised that a bunch of fans can make a mod that is more popular and overall better than their vanilla, especially since the infantry combat overhaul completely ruined it. Since the removal of GE and new combat overhaul game was made completely unplayable. 

Rest in Peace old Squad, we shall remember you..."
"Squad made numerous changes to its combat system in an attempt to create longer firefights and more engaging combat. They instead have created a combat experience that is 90 percent waiting for a guy to come to you because nobody wants to push when your soldier is a noodle armed bitch. So they have created ""longer"" gunfights in the sense that you will stare at an area for 20 minutes waiting for an enemy. However, that makes you one lucky son of a bitch because that means your squad is properly coordinating. In reality, 9 out of 10 games you will play will be with squadmates with no mics, SLs with no brains, and an experience that feels more like a sluggish knockoff of battlefield. The devs are so high up their ass with these 5 dollar skin cosmetics that they can't add basic QOL features like a slider for the sensitivity when using your binoculars, or making it so the game isn't an unoptimized mess. The asinine push to drop the ICO on the community has driven many veteran players out of the game leaving inexperienced/new players to take up SL(I'm glad new players are getting into the game but its a role requiring a good understanding of the game). Where as before the ICO you had veteran players, squad leading and creating an example for newer players to learn from, now you have SLs that are lost in the middle of nowhere creating FOBs with no effect on the game. Lets be clear here, the majority of the fun you will have in this game is having a COMPETENT SL and team. When you don't have those you are left with an asthmatic running simulator where you can shoot at some dudes. Now, the greatness that is the modding community for this game created a little mod called Global Escalation and it happened to remedy the problems with the combat. Things like pushes suddenly started happening and people were more inclined to communicate with one another due to the deadlier nature of gunfights. That's gone now. Either they or OWI fucked up and now its been replaced with a buggy, shitty, pale imitation. There are a thousand more reasons as to why this game is shit but that would take too much time. DO NOT BUY"
"I have over 400 hours on this game and love it, but they ruined it with the Combat Overhaul. The objective being realism, it was decided to make weapon sway and other forms of handling harder to actually shoot people. creating longer and more team oriented firefights. The problem is, no one I have ever seen use a firearm has had noodle arms this bad as the person holding these guns in game. With the removal of the Global Escalation Mod, the game is not too hard to play, but simply not fun. I recommend spending your money elsewhere."
Not that great. Not that terrible.
run for miles get shot in back of head run back die again
"Squad started off in Early Access a first person shooter where your ability to shoot was the least important thing you could bring to the team. Over the years OWI built upon this by adding systems that enforced both team-level strategic gameplay, and squad-level tactical gameplay, through the use of a logistics system, vehicle spawning systems, repair and rearm costs, and even the primary spawning mechanic required teamwork through having only one player be able to place spawns per squad. You really needed to work together as a team in order to even function so it attracted a certain type of player. A solo shooter could still have fun with the arcadey gunplay but would have very little effect on the overall team dynamic, the guy volunteering to do a logi run or build a HAB was the reason your team won and had fun. This was the balance originally advertised by OWI as a midpoint between mil-sim games such as Arma, and arcade shooters such as Battlefield. Unfortunately in the past couple years OWI have done away with that balance so the game now resembles any other generic arcade shooter. It's still a fun game, and the mods are some of the most impressive I've seen in any FPS game, but the community has all but disappeared and are unlikely to purchase a Squad 2 in future. Unfortunately the game was entirely reliant upon experienced players doing all the heavy lifting while new players learned but you'll struggle to find any servers now with people willing to do that as they have all left in protest over OWI's actions. This is OWI's only successful IP to date so I understand why they've decided to make the game more appealing to a wider audience but this was not what was promised to Early Access players and frankly if I wanted to play a Battlefield clone there's better examples."
"When I enter the game, it does not work. I do not know what the problem is, and a black screen appears"
Infantry Overhaul ruined this game
Fix the visibility bro i'm tired of shooting at pixels...
"As someone who persistently tries to enjoy tactical shooters, I found Squad to be a very frustrating game. I love the pieces but not the sum of the parts.  If Squad was a Lego set, I’d rather use the bricks to build something else. 

Squad is a great idea. It takes the boring organisational parts of Arma 3 out of the way so you can spend more time playing the game and enjoying the action. The game play is supported by loads of fun weapons, vehicles and factions. Diverse maps, solid movement mechanics and a good radio system which I found easy to use (once I had changed my keybinds to match Arma). The developers are continually supporting and updating the game, long time players would butt in here and highlight the ups and downs of the update history but at least the developers are there trying to improve the game. Or at the very least keep it fresh. It’s all sounding good so far, so where does my frustrating come from?

Firstly, one minor frustration that inconvenienced me on 80% of the sessions I played was that I could not create a party/group in the main menu and queue with my friends. I was trying to join servers in a group of 4-9 people for most of my playing time and it always added a layer of hassle that we couldn’t queue up together in some sort of quick play list. 

However, the main drive of my frustrations comes from something outside of the developer’s control. Squad relies heavily on those around you, meaning your fellow players. Offworld Industries provides the tools, but the players create the game. And unfortunately, when I played solo I found a Mos Eisley motley crew of whinge bags, poor leaders, unhelpful team players and worst of all the gormless. I myself was one of the latter gormless players who more than anything got in the way of those around me. I’ll share two anecdotes about different experiences I had in the game to highlight the different player types I’ve critically identified.

“I had solo queued into a fresh lobby and joined a random public squad. We headed out fairly normally from HQ but no one wanted to take on the fireteam lead slots. That was the fine until our squad leader decided to not immediately go for the OBJ and instead take a more logistical approach by securing a flank. At this point applications for fireteam lead were flying in and many voices of great wisdom tried to persuade the squad lead to change his course of action. They simply demanded he did what they wanted without explaining why their course of action was better, the squad lead had admitted his inexperience earlier in the game but did not relent to their demands. At this point 2/3 of the squad abandoned the plan and went off doing their own thing for the rest of the game. I remained with the squad leader and pointlessly followed him around for 45 minutes. We achieved nothing. But equally our other squad mates who went off on their own to the OBJ did not work together so they also achieved absolutely nothing.”

“I decided to give the squad leader role a try as I was playing with a full infantry section (i.e 9 people) from my arma group. Upon joining I tried to get some advice from the higher command structure about what my squad should do. This was met with a long silence and then the beginning of a new conversation. I would continue to seek guidance throughout the game. But I figured no one else had time to hold my hand through the game so I decided to make some plans for us… and what a shit show that became. We got squad wiped many times in a row, all of which were the fault of myself and the extreme expertise shown by our opponents. If I was Neville Chamberlain, I was facing down Napolean, Genghis Khan, Caesar and Saladin. We lost every game that night and it was the last time many of us tried to play Squad”

A skill issue. That’s my frustration with Squad, I’m simply not good at it. But I’m also not willing to get good at it in the current community landscape, so is the answer that I shouldn’t play? At the moment, the answer is yes. There’s plenty of YouTube guides out there and if I ever want to recreate my COVID years at university I know Squad is there for me. At the start of this “review” which has turned into the mother of all rambles, I praised Squad for taking the organisational burden away from Arma 3. However, that is also why I’ve quit Squad and I have 2,000 hours on Arma 3. In Arma players are put into roles that suit them and are shown how to do different things in the game by a human being, not a YouTube video. Arma 3 is a proficient noob academy that encourages new players to learn and get better. Squad takes a Spartan approach to learning, you either do it right or you die. 

To conclude Squad could be fantastic and I think it’s worth trying. But only if you don’t mind independently learning a game with a fair amount of nuance and rules of thumb. If you can go with the flow and appreciate the good games when they come to you and spend your time listening to other people recount that one incredible game. Then Squad is worth a purchase because the pieces made by Offworld are really good. Good luck and remember I’ve only got 17 badly played hours and a whole host of Arma 3 nostalgia."
"Stupid game studio with stupid decisions, managed by clowns.

Banned the best Mod available called ""The Real Invasion"". 

They made the worst game ever, people took it up themselves to create mods to create better gameplay and experience and they banned it. 

Tell me how can 2 kids can do a better job than a game studio. 

Absolute shitshow, don't buy this game. 

They even admitted they shut it down because it was competing with their servers lol."
This is just torture.
"I find the Game to get Boring way too fast.
The nearly 60$ Price Tag is no where near reasonable nor justifiable."
After the 8.0 update only urban maps are fun now
"unenjoyable game, the squad videos never show what its truly like.
hard to find good squad leads, half the time a squad leader is gonna have you building a HAB or driving vehicles and never detail that before you start heading out and other groups are locked.
not an enjoyable game if you dont feel like building a HAB 20 miles behind lines and sitting there as your squad leader leaves you, or decides to tell you to guard it. ICO made it a pain to do stuff"
"After I.C.O. update i left the game after it made the gun play feel so bad to me. Found out GE mod rolled that back so i came back about 6 months later for that. Now that GE is gone, i don't enjoy playing again. Supermod adds some cool stuff but with the vanilla gun play, it feels like putting makeup on a turd. I know OWI didn't pull the GE mod and that not keeping up with a rules change is why GE lost their License. Just hope they make changes and come back.
Obviously my own opinion."
"Squad used to be a game about small team infantry tactics, combined arms warfare, and blowing shit up with friends in a military themed chat room. 

Now its about Parkinson's disease.

and not only does every military soldier shake violently while shouldering their rifle, THE SWAY IS BASED ON YOUR FPS.

This game has had many other game breaking bugs in the past, and all the bugs stayed for way too long.

Used to be my favorite game of all time."
revert ico game is fucking horrible now
"too many hackers, ESPs, aimbots, ghosting. and they dont get caught."
"Developers keep the game in a stranglehold, introduce bad changes, absurd paid cosmetics and now remove a mod that was becoming more popular than vanilla due to some advertising technicality. They do not permit any meaningful freedom to mod developers nor server owners, absolutely pathetic coming from a game that at its origin ran off the coattails of PR2, a mod/game that was allowed (and still is allowed) to exist only because the developers of BF2 allowed their players the sort of leeway Offworld does not."
Game servers ran by age regressed manchildren.
TRASH GAME
was amazing game until combat over haul :(
"They overhaul the infantry combat system to slow the game way down and make it ""realistic"" and then ignore vehicle physics and damage. Bridging the gap between realism and arcade tac shooting my ***."
"I'm going to preface with this; I love Squad. But I despise the ICO changes. I can't get into the game anymore because of the decisions they made for infantry combat. The only time I play anymore is if my friends are on and playing on a Steel Division mod server, which has ""kinda-sorta"" pre ICO.

I sincerely hope they rework the ICO changes."
gay admins banned me
Removed one of the best mods for the game for no reason
"Offworld industries is running this game like North Korea. They're dictating _everything_ server owners can do and the last straw for me was how they just blatantly kicked out the Global Offensive mod, which was much better and deeper than the base game has ever been.

The devs _NEVER_ comment on anything in Steam forums, be it critique or a development suggestions. They just do what they want and us, the paying customers, can either take what they give us or hit the road.

I can't in good conscience recommend that anyone would hand out their hard earned money to a group of .. people whom treat their customers like trash."
"Honestly a fall from grace of what this game once was, actively claiming realism while buffing obvious light skin vehicles making AT frustrating at best and infantry battles just a slower paced CoD match.

Overall fun amazing gunplay roots with recent shitty buffs to factions that should be unfairly armed but take skill and players co-ordinated to operate effectively and it'd be fun to have an underpowered faction use good teamwork to overcome a better equipped enemy. All factions vehicles are the same with a reskin not really any differences in armor or weapons between them all they all tank the same amount of AT or ATGMs as the opposing force. Blufor are underpowered, Opfor are overpowerd and balanced to a T to please their parent company based in China to not cut their funding.

Good potential, frustrating shit game realistically.
That being said fun to just BS and play with the lads whenever you are bored and want a good more graphically enhanced Arma experience with less focus on realism and more focus on balanced Overwatch-like fun."
"Dont waste your money on this game the devs ruined it ive tried everything to get it to run smooth on my pc but it wont my specs are i9 13900k rtx 3070ti 32gb ramm. If you like running in mud, way too much gun sway, and the slowest ads in a game ive ever seen this may be your game. I cannot refund the game but i hope my honest opinion saves other people money. Your wanna a good game play hell let loose instead,"
Consistently terrible throughout the entire experience. I allow you to seethe in the comments

"As soon as they implemented the new recoil system a while back, I saw videos of it, and hated it immediately. I finally decided to come back a try it out ""it can't be that bad."" It is that bad, this recoil makes no sense, does not get rid of lone wolves and i basically can't see for the majority of the time i'm playing. I can't die, I can't hit anything... So who is this for? Were they attempting to strip the last remaining 200 players of Project Reality? I don't understand why this was necessary or why they have ran with this joke for as long as they have. 
They ruined my favorite game. This was the first game I had a hundred hours in on steam, all the way back in 2016. All the fond memories, all of which I can't relive because they went this horrible direction. The game runs worse, there is LESS communication. I don't know who this game is for anymore, and i'm surprised there are this many people playing it. I don't know what is wrong with some of you, I don't know why you prefer worse quality game play, and I can't begin to imagine why some of you like this recoil. I'm pretty sure you've gaslit yourselves into believing it's fun. Well it isn't. This is not Project Reality. 
I liked the time where, if I wanted to play PR, I'd play PR, if I wanted to play Squad, I'd play Squad. Well now I can't play Squad. Squad doesn't exist anymore. There is only whatever this is, masquerading and bumbling around in the dead rotted corpse of some of my fondest memories. Curse you."
This game was made by the government to correct over population and increase suicide rate
It is bad game.
"I was excited to try Squad. But I was genuinely disappointed. Getting into a server and getting into the action feels like a chore; in fact, most of the game feels like a chore. Most of the time, people are switching squads left and right, and administrators are kicking and banning people. You barely get to see any action. I know this is a team-based shooter with slower-paced gameplay, but damn, this does not feel good to play. The gunplay just feels wonky at best. The game overall feels very niche."
Devs got jealous that a mod was doing better than the base game and had more content & more frequent updates and took it down. I think they forgot that they still profit when people buy their game to play the mod though...
i'd rather rub cs gas into my throat with a brush than play this game again
Awful
bug ridden garbage
I Cannot believe they removed my favourite mod Global Escalation..... Not happy at all. Proximity Chat should function like it states and not be restricted to teams.
"Game is held together with sticks and duct tape. It is in a messy and unprofessional state in terms of its stability.

To name a few of the issues:

Tank armor angle is based on the world position rather than relative. In other words, tank armor is based on your global direction. You can shoot a tank in its weakest spot but because it was facing north it takes no damage. Or vice versa.

Changing your FOV will worsen your scope sway, making it harder to play.

Using a mouse with too high of a refresh rate will SOMEHOW cause your game to lag.

Shooting your gun for the first time in the match will cause a huge lag spike for you.

TOW weapons are client side. Meaning that you can hit on your screen but because the enemy's computer disagrees it doesnt count as a hit.

There are tons on baffling and nonsensical issues that plague the game making it very difficult to play or enjoy. The developers do not seem to be interested in fixing these issues as they have been issues for quite a while and getting worse. I would steer clear until they actually address the stability and playability issues."
too many bug
Day by day it is getting worse. There are problems with the frames. A solution must be developed for this problem. I am tired of the problems. I hope in the next conversations that it will return to what it was like 4 months ago.
devs are obsesed with ruinging the gayeme
"Squad seems to be the only game I have framerate issues with. I think Squad programmers don't seem to know what performant code is, and OWI needs to think about hiring more experienced developers."
GE removal is very dissapointing while vanilla version is boring.
"Well after a long time playing this game was truly amazing. First OWI drops their controversial ICO (Infantry Combat Overhaul) which aimed to make the playstyle more realistic which ended up being the exact opposite making your soldier feel like a 500 pound fat man and take 5 years to bring the weapon optic up to your face which gets you killed by campers (extremely defender sided) I never thought id have to write a review but they recently removed the mod Global Escalation which aimed towards fixing the game and created real world factions such as IDF HAMAS and HEZBOLLAH and proximity chat which made the game so much more enjoyable and when I started playing it a lot more. I felt the game was alive and I had a bond with my squad with the GE mod until it was stripped from the community due to ""controversy and advertisment in the maps and license issues"". which has made me completly delete the game and uninstall it. i will not be coming back until the mod comes back. Fuck you OWI go fix your own game first before you stick your fingers in someone elses hard worked mod that fixed your shit game. Tzahal OUT"
"Gunplay after the ICO update was garbage. Got back into the game after the Global Escalation mod got popular. GE fixed the gunplay added new shit, fixed just about everything OWI refused to. OWI being a bunch of salty bastards removes the only mod making the game good. Bring back Global Escalation!"
"Runs poorly, still waiting for the fun to start, poor community overall. Overhyped."
OWI delisting the most popular mod instead of fixing game breaking bugs
"The game can be fun in the right server, but as of recently server mods and OWI have not been dealing with toxic players who are spewing racial slurs and hate speech in 75% of the different servers I have been in. There is a very convoluted reporting process that does not allow for a timely report to be submitted so most of the time it is not worth it. There is also a very steep learning curve that is very difficult for new players, who are seen as a hindrance by players. I do not recommend downloading this game unless you plan to just chat in discord and not in the server. There is no teamwork as of recent and a lot of team killing and trolling unfortunately. I feel a lot of people blame the large ICO update that happened a while back, but it is definitely just the community becoming toxic that has driven a lot of people away."
Dont recommend they just banned the only good mod that had silencers as well as many other factions..
"recent changes to gunplay have made the gunplay way worse and less fun. the difficulty of finding games where both teams are organized and competitive means you can waste an hour on a game that's decided in the first five minutes. when the actual gunplay isn't fun any more, the downsides mean it is often becomes a boring walking simulator. that said, driving a logistics truck around the back lines is decently zen and fun. so buy if you are into trucking games."
"After its newest update and with GE being ripped from us following the update, this game is as vanilla as ever..."
"Removed the only thing keeping this game alive, our beloved OWI removes mods that become more popular than the base game. Global Escalation was the only thing that kept me playing this game, the vanilla game including factions, weapons and vehicles are a direct downgrade from the mod. But hey, at least we got Arma Reforger been having a blast and recommend it to anyone."
Global escalation was the only thing keeping this game alive. It's about to be dead just like Squad 44.
"Game used to be so fun, but afyer the latest updates its literally bags of shits, instead of arms of a trained soldier you get 90 year old grampa with noodle hands that can barely hold the gun, and then they removed GLOBAL Escolation mod that fixed the most issues and made the game even more fun."
"NO WAY !!! They just removed the best mod in the game, Global Escalation. Until this changes, this game is NOT worth it, at all. I just can't believe the Devs made such poor decision, you know what, this is what you get !"
"They've just removed the last good thing about this game, Global Escalation. Until this changes, this game is NOT worth it, at all."
game used to be good
.
Everything on squad was going good until they decided to do away with global escalation if they dont bring it back im not playing anymore
imagine having a game run on a single cpu core and not fixing it
game is good on good servers and game is horrific on bad servers.  Most of the servers in Asia have zero communication and you are left to just play a shitastic version of call of duty.  Game is worthless in asia.
"Trash game, would not recommend. Wish I could refund but i kept giving it a try to double check if i was the problem and not the game. Nope, game is ass. Hell Let Loose is so much better."
games toxic wish this was made with proper servers not wanna be military geeks running servers battlefield modded servers are 10x better hackers everywhere
"I shot and missed, uninstalled"
Just dont
"Attaching weapon sway to your FPS is of course deeply meritocratic in nature, but still kinda unfair"
"Feels like a hungry 14 year old is handling the guns, hipfire has a higher accuracy than aiming and 80% of guns have useless scopes, sprinting makes you drunk and you won't get much FPS"
game just literaly dosent work and black screen loads for hours till u cant refund anymore shame too since the starwars mod looked kinda fun
can more people tell them to optimize the game. i have a 4090 and ryzen 7950x3d like cmon why does this game run like such shit they havent optimized it since early access this just isnt okay
base game an global esc NOT good only lazer mod worth a darn wouldnt recommmend
"ICO SUCKS!!! This is so realistic its not even called realistic anymore its beyond that... Like Parkinson's disease hand simulator... Tu parece um bêbado atirando de cabeça para baixo vendado e caolho, simples assim."
"If you load up the game you payed for and decline their privacy policy, the game just closes. 

Lmfao"
"Infantry overhaul is pain in the ass, marksman role is useless, overall recoil of the game is so EPIC 2x times bigger then shooting NEGEV from CSGO :D... unplayable
Every single SQUAD player is complaining about chicken HANDS, suppression not giving blur but makes your recoils 10x bigger and to shoot while you just finished running is impossible. GIVE US THE GOOD OLD SQUAD INFANTRY BACK... 
Armours unplayable too, shots now depends on how tanks are turned, because of god damns DEV bugs for armour units..."
The optimization of this game after a couple of updates Is held by hopes and dreams
The optimization in this game is awful. I have a rig that will run most games on ultra settings. this game does good to get 30 on medium. and then your always having connection or network issues. i have gig speed internet and still have this problem. they say in game dont forget to verify the integrity of your game files on steam to keep the game running good but i shouldnt have to do that. while in battle theres a constant stream of disconnected players on the top left of the screen. that said the idea behind this game is awesome and it can be alot of fun and is insanely in depth and can go deeper just fix the issues with it
"In 2024, it shows its age. The game is poorly optimized with numerous unnecessary visual effects that look good but ruin the performance. Additionally, if you do not enjoy the modern warfare atmosphere, you may quickly become bored with this game.

Squad attempts to offer a realistic and immersive military experience, but several key issues hold it back:

Optimization Issues: Despite its potential, the game's poor optimization leads to frequent frame drops and lag, making it difficult to enjoy, especially during intense firefights.

Visual Effects: While the visual effects are impressive, they are often overdone. This results in a visually appealing game that, unfortunately, suffers from significant performance issues.

Modern Warfare Theme: The modern warfare setting may not appeal to everyone. If you are not a fan of this genre, you might find yourself losing interest rather quickly.

Complexity and Learning Curve: The game’s realistic mechanics require a steep learning curve. New players might find it overwhelming without prior experience in similar games.

Genre Competition: If you are already playing a game in a similar genre, there is little reason to switch to Squad. The game does not offer enough unique features to justify the change in my opinion."
"This is my favourite game and i have a lot of good memories from it and i also have met few good friends in it. 
The reason i post a negative review is Because the Devs don't make good decisions. the game doesnt need more content, it never needed after the amphibious update. What this game needs is Bug fixes and A LOT OF Optimisation. i remember when this game was enjoyable to play because it gave me more than 30FPS and the FPS didnt effect the gun's recoil"
maps are too big
"After 821 hours in this game, I decided to come back and see if it got any better from the weapon/aiming updates they did to the game. Before the changes, the game was great. Thus the reason for the 821 hours into the game. 

After coming back to it and playing for a day, I remembered the reason why i decided to delete it. If you're looking for a better game, look at Hell Let Loose. 

Yes, this has more vehicles and helicopters, but overall the combat isnt that fun in this."
auto replay not working
if you love watching paint dry for 5 hours and occasionally having your balls stepped on then this is the game for you
fun game bad optimization dont get it unless nasa computer
far too technical for such a toxic and racist community
I would recommend this game if someone could give me the game
"Instead of fixing bugs and adding some more functions in game to let us have fun, they are adding a new fractions, useless animations and vehicles with more bugs in them.
10 years of development $500k spent and $6 mil earned, can't you fucking FIX THE DAMN BUGS??
When was the last time you guys fixed SOMETHING at LEAST.

Here are some bugs:
- When reloading the weapon and completing the animation it's not really reloading it, it's getting stuck in SUPERPOSITION, can't reload again and can't shoot, you need to wait 3-5 minutes to let it fix.
- Character and camera are sometimes getting disconnected from their axis.
- While shooting from heli MG, you may get shot from your own bullet cuz there are no physics in this game, heli goes faster than bullet i guess.
- Unable to place defensive structures on places which you can literally see but for some reason it says ""placement out of sight"".
- Bots able to shoot through the walls and cross middle points (red zones) while seeding.
- There's one particular RPG which you can't shoot, it's shooting but freezing in the middle of the air before impact.
- Fraction voting, this is a joke, there are times when there is only 1 country to choose from all 6 individual options, CHINA CHINA CHINA in every god damn option.
- Fix the shadows
- When sitting on Humvee's 50 cal if you aim up, you feel like your head is down and they can't shoot you but in reality your head is still up and this gives you confusion of how they killed you.
- Mines disappearing after you look away (Am i joke to you?)


Things which should have been added:
- God damn mirrors on vehicles (there are no mirrors)
- Helicopter repelling system
- Helicopter Autopilot (every god damn heli have autopilot)
- Function to rename your squad (you have to disband your squad and create new one in order to follow the server rules for claiming the vehicle.
- More choice of scopes on rifles.
- Commander able to call artillery strike from the map and not only if he/she sees it.
- It shouldn't take this much time to equip a pistol while holding rifle or RPG.
- Animations should be allowed on battlefield, that's what they are for.
- Fire Team Leads should be able to find out the fucking range when marking something.

Hope you chicken nugget brained Project Managers and Owners will see this.
FIX BUGS! DO NOT ADD MORE OF THEM!"
textures not loading
"Rarely do people ever use comms anymore, dont bother playing"
I had more fun when you could shoulder your rifle.
"Clear line of sight, aim, fire 2 rounds, and I'm blind.....stupid. Enemies and friendlies wear IDENTICAL equipment. Stupid. You change your weapon, loadout, or sight......and you spawn with 1 primary mag/belt and no secondary ammo, bandages, or grenades. This is the worst MILSIM i have played in a long time."

"You are a trained soldier for whichever nation, so ofcourse you'll be moving like a grandmother.
You are a trained soldier, getting shot at and adrenaline is pumping, ofcourse you'll take 99 years to aim down sights.
You are a trained soldier, with adrenaline pumping through your veins. Ofcourse running 20 meters will be your outmost limit!!11

The overhaul is complete dogshit and i dont understand why they have implemented it. Surely not for realism, and if this perfromance is realistic in their minds, its because theyre office fatties that put on some gear and weapons, tried running and thought "" man that sure was hard "".

I dont see how else they deem this overhaul realistic lol."
"clunky, don't buy unless under 5 usd"
who asked for this voting system? it makes this game repetitive and dull. Also the stupid aiming mechanics - knee cap entire factions for no reason. usa vs russia. yawn.
ass
Game blue screened ):
i was yelled at by a bunch of 30 year old wanna be mil sim fat lards that cant move there own legs to join the army
full of russians to many
"pretty bad game, too bad i am not eligible for a refund anymore"
"""realistic"" shooter. Player literally has not held a gun in their life or past lives. Cannot aim properly, recoil everywhere, honestly the original tarkov recoil is better then the recoil in this game. Someone chirping a fire alarm over prox chat was better and more enjoyable then the infantry gameplay. Armor slaps though."
cant sex the soldiers :(
:)
"If you play in OCE it's very difficult to get a server through the week as all are full or seeding at 10-20/100 players and never get above that. If you do find a server, prepare to have everyone lock squads and leave you to your own devices on enormous maps while other squad leaders complaining about you being 'useless'. 

Also playing the tutorial and one full game will put you outside of the 2 hour window for a refund, so hope you find out if you like it in the tutorial."
"Updating review after 500 more hours:

Bugs still in the game from multiple years ago. Performance struggles more and more with each update. Half baked content and devs that don't play their own game. Either wayyyyy over nerfing things or wayyyyy over balancing them. 

Its again the common problem of a game with great potential that gets spanked by indifferent/ignorant devs or a corporate system that just doesn't care. 

I still play the game often but its more because there aren't any alternatives that really fill the gap. Hopefully the dev team will actually pay attention to the communities needs/wants and give us better tools, a *real* performance update and balance things better."
i dont get it
"I love the game, i love the community the game fosters,but i cannot in good conscience recommend this game on the basis of its poor optimization; update after update OWI has introduced more things to play with but never adequately optimizing the game."
"Inferior overpriced Project Reality, hald @$$ed realism for 70$"
"If you enjoy military simulators then buy Arma 3 or some 1st person simulator because this game is absolute garbage.

Only upside is you can refund it :P"
Constant crashes even with graphics settings at the lowest. I have a RTX 3060ti and a Ryzen 7 5700x and this game still wants to keep crashing on me
allahu akbar
"honestly not a fun game, you can barely even see the enemy and your team mates should have blue/green CLEAR markers on who they are otherwise your just getting team kills.  the cheaters in the game is UNREAL"
"this is the WORST fps money can buy, guns are unrealistic, game play is lack, you have a bunch of kids who think they are real life soldiers, be ready to have like 15 people blairing music full blast or screaming to try and blow out your ear drums, for a game thats based off real military exp then it should be just that a real milsim exp, not this."
"low fps, vsing invisible bush wookies, only good thing is the voip"
lots of lags
Talvez mi computadora no corra este juego pero si qué esta mal en mi para mi.
"Controls are not correct.  I constantly have to close the game and restart because basic movement does not work at times.  Examples?  ""A"" does not work to strife left sometimes.  The map sometimes keeps popping up for no reason at all during game play.  Pops up immediately when I close it.  So frustrating!  Totally feel like I wasted my money"
Last game reece played with us... #RipMyDrilla
Good game but very annoying at time with the loading bugs and errors. could do with some work in the launching aspect of the game !
They need to fix the infantry overhaul. The infantry overhaul sucks.
FAGGOT NOT LETTING ME INTO THE CAR
"The overhaul is the worst thing the devs had came up with. This is a game that is meant to be enjoyed, not a game that is considered as ""too realistic"" after the overhaul, you can't even shoot a guy that is 3 ft away from you, that sucks, the weapon sway is way too far from realistic. I myself a gun owner, I can say that this overhaul is a fail. You'll lose players in the long run if you wont fix this, it is too impossible to shoot enemies even at 100 meters away even if you have a bipod/tripod on."
The infantry overhaul sucks!! not worth
"Came back to this after a hiatus of about a year and...

WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO MY BOY!

the map vote, means its ALWAYS desert maps, USA v RUS, without fail.

And the new weapon sway? unusable. I had a shootout in my last game, we were less than 25m from each other. We actually both  ran out of ammo and decided to run away. 

Also, in games of past I had a cool 50+ fps even with the recreation of Armageddon taking place, but now, one barrage and my game is a slideshow...

OWI, what did you do!?"
"Great game when it works, but far too difficult to find a server - I spent 45 minutes queuing in various queues. Only to join a server where all the squads were locked and you are kicked after 4 minutes without a squad. If you create a squad you have to lead it. In order to lead a squad you need to know what you are doing - but you can't learn that if you can never play. 

On the rare off chance you can play it, the game is great."

"Played Squad for years.

The ICO needs some tweaks, but that's nothing.
I used to be able to play smoothly with mid/high settings.
The game gradually got worse and worse performance wise, with everything on low, the same rig painfully gets around 50 FPS with stutters.

Changed my 2060 super for a 4070 super.
Nothing changed.

OCed my Ryzen 3700X 8 core
Nothing changed.

32 GB ram since the beginning.

Do something please, I can't play it anymore"
"I would give this game a good review, but this audio not working has been a problem for how long now??? You fix things that dont matter and ignore things that make people not want to play your game."
"god i wish they just had the time and money to make this game feel good. this game has everything you want content wise, it is just SEVERELY lacking as far as its bugginess and play-ability. half the games i play it feels like my character is off a full bottle of benadryl its so sluggish and aggravating. even on my friends pc which has a 3080 ti and i9 it feels like shit. ive managed to force myself through near 700 hours of this game and am finally coming to a point where i cant stand its spaghetti code any longer. i really love this game, but its just too aggravating now. i have a 1080 ti, i7-7800x, game is on my ssd, and i have ethernet making 100+ mb/s, monitor 240hz, and drink enough coors light to make any family man grab his keys and go on a drunken blast through residential streets(i can force myself to do things that are bad for my mental and physical wellbeing{like playing this game}) please fix this shit"
"I want to recommend Squad, but the game has made some very bad game play decisions. Some examples:
- Community servers. The state of most servers right now is horrendous. With clan stacking being the norm and ""new player friendly"" servers being an excuse to ignore game play basics (lone wolf players (cough HAT/Marksman/Combat Engineer) and silent squads). 
- The ICO overhaul. Say what you want about it, but we have to agree that most of the community player base can't handle it. After OWI spent years drawing in more casual players and pushing away the experienced player base, they changed gun handling for the worse. Now the vast majority of the player base can't hit anything outside of 200m.
- Faction voting and sub-factions. While a good idea, it butchered the game's balance. Factions were previously balanced around certain maps with certain vehicle assets for that map. The system now is a rock-paper-scissors game where you hope your team picks a sub-faction that can compete with what the enemy picks. Oops your team meme picked the British support sub-faction and the enemy went Russian armored, enjoy watching your heli's get main gunned out of the sky while your armor gets rolled by T-90s (fighting a T-90 in a Challenger is hilariously painful). Oops you picked a non support or armored sub-faction against the Insurgents, enjoy getting your only HAB mortared/IED'd or the funny four IEDs on the commander drone that keeps your tank from ever seeing the battle (the drone call-in timer is less than the tanks respawn timer). Most Factions now need a major rebalancing before the voting system works in pubs."
over rated and over hyped  save your money adds are very misleading and older players are very judgy and wont help you out understanding a lot of things
"Do not buy this game. They are a Canadian based gaming company who do not tolerate any forms of speech the admins don't agree with. Save your money if you're looking for something fun to play.

They also have certain actions developed in the game that you can do that can get you banned as a regular player. I didn't know this and that is grounds as a scam.

Again, save your money."
Als HAT die ganze Runde nichts machen können. Entweder campen irgendwelche hobbylosen harzer in der letzten Ecke und snipen dich weg oder du siehst einfach nichts weil dein ganzer Bildschirm verschwommen ist nach einem beinahe treffer von nem Panzer. Abnormaler Müll und Game bockt gar nicht mehr. Geld definitiv nicht wert
"Coming from Project Reality I can't recommend Squad with the present community. Game named Squad but there's no proper squads, lack of communication, lack of discipline, lack of everything that makes a game a military sim. Good job to the developers for developing a pretty good game(Except the UI which might be the most confusing stuff I've ever seen in a video game) but without a community playing the game as it was created to be played its not worth trying it. Every time I play this the squad is either spread out, together but pushing straight into a death trap or not communicating at all."
Are you friendly or enemy simulator
"Spawnkilling, toxic players who boot you from your SQUAD and reset your loadout so you can't get the interesting gear as a newbie, garbage maps that are way too big unless you play this game with a dedicated semi-pro or pro team for days and days to learn, way too ""realistic"" HUD (I don't mind some to avoid being arcadey but not being able to see your ammo count or prevent friendly fire if you're colorblind is annoying and doesn't add anything to the experience). Toxic userbase. Poor man's Battlefield 2. Expect to trudge around and die alot with no clue why or how, a lot. Not fun in the least except to Milsimps who like to wipe the floor with pick up groups to compensate for their micropenises."
"Used to love this game, but slowly over time the player base has degraded and thus the quality of game has diminished. In theory great game. The infantry overhaul was a great idea, but it turned off too many of the experienced players, who wanted even games.
Now we are mostly left with long server wait times, followed by heavily uneven games, between which teams are not balanced."
"Game itself is amazing, but the lack of performance is a very very very big down fall!!!!!!!!!!!!! the Fps drops, stutters, and over all performance is completely TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i run a Asus Rog 4090 OC , 10900k, with 64gb ram at 4000mhz. samsung g series 240hz screen and i get NO MORE THEN 100 FPS MAX MAX if im lucky 15-20% cpu usage, and 20-30 GPu usage. no matter what settings are used does not and WILL NOT go above 100 fps EVER!!!! getting as low as 30 fps!!!!!! example i can run Cyberpunk MAX everything and still get 144 fps. so to me a very much less demanding game like Squad i should easily be getting much more fps"
"Revert I.C.O for 3 months and see what the newbs think. Then re install the I.C.O. and watch all the spam ""Good game."" reviews go away."
"Haven't enjoyed playing infantry since the ICO update, haven't enjoyed any match at all with faction voting."
"its a very bad game and you dont know even who to shoot ... its a worst 38 min of my gaming life .. its bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad ... irts like you dont know where are you or who is with who or what r u doing or what ,..... baaaaaaaaaaad"
"If you don't live in Turkey, do NOT waste your money on it, there's no active players at all, I've literally waited 7 hours to find a match and found one but it was for Turkish people only and they only spoke Turkish, the game is really good but as an online-only game it's unplayable without other active players worldwide."
"Pre-ICO? I'd recommend this game 10 times out of 10.

Post ICO? Lol. Lmao, even."
Walking simulator.
"4 years since the official release date and still no offline vs bots support. Even PRBF2 does have it, a formidable game like this lacking such a simple feature is a big no for me."
ICO ruined my enjoyment of this game. If they tone it all down a little I might come back and try it out. Until then I will not play this game again.
this combat update took you from being a trained soldier to being a gimp picking up a rifle for the first time. I can shoot an AK with one hand and have less recoil and sway than this. I know the devs probably saw body cam and thought it would be a cool idea to do that for their game but you can tell the two teenagers put more effort into making it work than this entire team did.
"Sold out to the Chinese communist gobermint and you wonder why the Chinese faction gets buffs and stupid emojis in the game. Enjoy yer dictator money. Won't be seeing my freedom buckos or freedom time spent on this until Tencent is gone~

Shame, game use to be decent~"
"Returned to the game after not playing for awhile and I can easily say the Infantry Combat Overhaul update absolutely ruined the game play. It changed nothing about infantry other than making aiming insanely frustrating. Anyone who says they like the changes either didn't play before the update, only play vehicles, or are a liar."
Did you just wait in a 20+ queue and now you are the next one to join? Ha! connection issue back of the queue for you. Did you just get into a match after literally waiting an hour becuase there are only a handful of good playable servers? Disconnect. F you. No fun allowed.
"Overall I feel like there's something that just feels off about Squad when I compare it to my experience playing Hell let loose & Squad 44.  Those games have been full of incredible moments time after time, where as Squad has so far felt dull and a big waste of time.

I'm willing to give it another go, so my review may change but as of now I would not recommend it over similar games."
"The game feels really slow, it feels like it takes 10 minutes to run a kilometer. the maps are VERY spaced out and sparse of action. You cant spawn vehicles anywhere or find them anywhere on the map other than main base so get used to running. On top of the very slow game play, every gun has the recoil of a PKM for some odd reason. oh ya and my joystick doesn't work with this game"
"I love the format of this game and gameplay, but server admins can't take a joke and will perma ban you to take the fun out of the game and every server is the same way due to game rules. They also made the game more demanding on your PC without the graphics looking better since the last few updates."
"Coming back to this game after the ICO update, I can't believe people enjoy that amount of ""handicapping"" this game has done to infantry. It's extremely difficult to aim after a short run to where it's not even close to anything realistic. I feel like someone is molesting the end of my rifle when I try to ADS. I understand they want to make it more team oriented, but they didn't need to ruin the joy of actually shooting."
"You need to optimize the game, it's almost impossible to play it every second stuck"
all servers have a minimum 10 minute wait. when you finally get into a server i almost instantly get kicked.
The servers are not te find in this game. itryed everything but still show no servers
"It was good, but Devs are not solving DX12 crash issues, grafics are very bad and Arma reforger does everything better by factor 10.

As MilSim player I was happy to have Squad, but it didn't developed very well in a technical sense. The only reason for Squads existense is that Armas entrance barrier was so high. With arma reforger as a tech demo for arma 4 it seems like the days of Squad for real Milsim Gamers are over."
"Game sucks, you won't ever see the enemy and they will always kill you before you do.

No joke, this is one of the worst games I have every wasted too much time on.

All of the mechanics and gun play is perfectly fine, you will just never get a chance to actually use it on the enemy."
ICO
ICO did this game dirty
terrible
This game used to be good. This is no longer true.
Game runs and looks like shit. Instead of optimisation we get weapon skins and emotes. Borderline unplayable.
"For some reason the gameplay is not interesting and confusing at all. Compared to warzone, this game is very far behind with a distance of tens of kilometers"
"the developers have slop in their heads, a vivid example of ""how to fuck up a promising game"""
"Pretty much meh, buggy, clunky, just yeah meh"
"Was a great game, not anymore."
once great game but its just shit now
"The developers don’t understand what they’re doing, it feels like the team of developers has already changed 2 or 3 times, or this game is being made by an outsourced company, otherwise I can’t explain how you can make the game worse and worse with each update, not fix bugs for years and still create visibility of work on the game.
Introducing new things into the gameplay without preliminary long testing, it all has already turned into one huge snowball. There is no longer any faction balance that still existed before the introduction of units, which was also destroyed by ICO update without reworking/adjusting number of tickets on all layers for each faction.
Every new update they release some thing that no one asked for and it turns the gameplay into hell. Then they try to fix it, introduce something new for balance, and then immediately add another piece of garbage that no one asked for and it breaks another part of the balance/gameplay.
Btw this game has nothing to do with PR in any way and never will be in the future."
Absolutely terrible gunplay

Gameplay: ■■■■■■■■□□
Graphics: ■■■■■■□□□□

[i] This game has potential, that's for sure, but lack of optimization is killing the immersive aspect of this game. When you buy a high-end PC, you expect to play this game on 120 FPS consistently. Graphics are nothing special and every FPS drop is really bothering. Gameplay is good, realistic and feels like you are in a war, but games today don't have any optimizations in them and I can't recommend this game to anyone who don't have really, really strong hardware. Skip this one for now! [/i]"
DOA
It's the biggest piece of dogshit
Better buy Arma 3
.
Гра не тягне на новіших ПК. Оптимізуйте гру!!!!
Boring asf
"This game used to be so much fun until the infantry overhaul. I can no longer recommend it to anyone looking for a good FPS experience. The inertia, weapon sway, and recoil is unbelievably over-tuned, and the stamina system is just obnoxious. It takes a good 10 seconds to come from a light jog to lining up a shot accurately, and it has nothing to do with the FPS skill of the player. It's also hilarious how inaccurate hip-firing is. You almost have no choice but to sit in one spot or crab-walk around the map. It's just not fun at all anymore."
this game has so much potential but until they're able to optimize the game i am going to have to say pass on getting the game
"The game that I fell in love with doesn't exist anymore. A series of poor decisions and terrible updates have spoiled Squad. I spent a lot of late nights with some good people on this game in 2022 but wouldn't suggest it these days. The community seems worse than it used to be as well, impressively.

Might still be worth a try for the veterans; I know it was cathartic for me at one point in time."
2022 squad better
"learning curve is steep, community is mid. gun go brr tho"
"Old Squad was good, teams worked together and things happened. Then everything changed when the corporate overlords attacked. Infantry Combat Overhaul is the -Worst- single decision I've ever seen a game make; if Parkinsons Simulator meets Walking Simulator is your thing, this is the game for you. Otherwise, the buyout completely ruined Vanilla Squad. The only worthwhile servers are ones that use mods like Global Escalation that reverse that garbage update. 

Oh, they're also just ripping content from modding communities and calling it their own for their latest updates now, like the MK19, the M113, new factions, etc. They don't make any decent content anymore."
trash game ...poorly optimized
"Update
Its ok, noodle arms is annoying even when standing still and the ability of someone to shoot through the edge of the wall to 'headshot' your toe for a kill is annoying.

Update with the new PMCs 8.1
Noodle arms is really annoying and feels like its more RNG Jesus if your bullet will go straight within 10m instead of not. Some days you will land all your shots, another you will be prone, laying down, holding still and the arms will still go all wiggly on you."
Mod not working
"A game where I'm effectively a child soldier when it comes to weapon handling. On top of muzzle climb being far greater than it should ever be, now I can't even aim my rifle. If this was a child soldier simulator, I guess this could make sense, but the fact that this is meant to be a realistic game, I don't see the realism in how untrained these soldiers are at firing their rifles."
shit game
Very sensitive community. not worth the time.
"noodle arms. useless scopes, terrible guns. Squad was better long time ago. I'm out"
"This was a $40 cad game, wtf happened."
"Honestly i would not recommend the game right now. After the combat update the game just does not feel as enjoyable as it used to. The whole aiming and scope moving this i feel is way too much right now. I believe if the game moved to a sort of a middle ground between this update and how it used to, it would be awesome. Otherwise great game"
"Only works for high tec alienware pc, fps lag is crazy for this simple budget game"
Making it take 10 years for a sight to stabilize just so you can shoot once before having to wait again was the most retarded decision OWI has ever made.
every time it throws me out of the game and it is annoying me so much
"Sad to down vote this game, but the recent changes to the infantry is quite unplayable. Being suppressed actually makes you blind and unable to play the game and the changes to the scopes are terrible. It feels the only way to have a decent time in this game now is with vehicles. It is a shame but I have uninstalled this and will not install until they fix the infantry gameplay."
"Fun game, ruined by lack of optimization. Developers more interested in putting out yet another faction no one asked for instead of fixing basic game breaking issues. Don't."
The servers are just awful. List of rules the length of your arm. Get kicked out of vehicles for no reason. Can't recommend this game.
Game great woman mad
:(
"Thank you for killing my favourite videogame with useless ICO. Not even talking about the optimization, textures from 2006, bugs which has not been fixed for years and all the promises of content to be delivered which never came to life. You keep adding new factions which, at the end of the day, are just reskins. The gameplay stays the same. There are so many exciting things which could have been added to the game, but instead, you decide to rework the shooting mechanics when it was absolutely unnecessary. Good luck with piling this videogame further into the mud with your incompetent game developing."
not what it use to be. the gun play sucks and is not fun
"last time i played was more than a year ago, and to absolutely no ones surprise they ruined the game because every single developer these days make changes simply for the sake of change. your character feels like they are walking on the surface of jupiter and went through physical therapy for 2 broken legs that never healed correctly. i understand that its supposed to be your heavy equipment but its so poorly done and feels awful. and ADS is completely unusable unless your laying prone. after a light sprint if you try to ADS it takes about 3 whole seconds to have a good look down your sights, make that 5 seconds if youre using a scope or ACOG. if youre truly going for realism then take away maps. soldiers dont carry maps with them that show live attack plans. and why do guns never jam or have to be maintained? why can i get shot in the face just for my team mate to magically revive me 7 seconds later? the point im making is this isnt all that realistic of a game anyways so you might as well just give the combat a bit more of an arcadey feel so that we can at least actually shoot at people."
"Just came back to this game after a few months and it constantly crashes. 

Unplayable in its current state."
Aiming sucks
"gimme your data 
  -squad"
"the game is a walking simulator, and onec you get into combat, you imidaitly get shot, plus most of the game your doing nothing"
it  crashes everytime
"Squad is like you took the worst parts of Insurgency and Arma and put them together.

Which is a particularly bad compromise.

It also runs like poo"
"i join a squad, get kicked from squad, join another squad, get kicked from other squad, get kicked from server for not being in a squad for 0.03 microseconds.....never again"
"No longer a solid game. Don't say anything that might offend someone in most any server, never mind the fact that the game is about shooting ppl in the head. It is my understanding that this is enforced / forced by the publisher of the game since they control the servers you rent *unconfirmed*. 

Decent game if you dont mind keeping your mouth shut. STAY AWAY, there are plenty of other games."
"The reviews for a game like Squad should never be in the ""Very Positive"". Like have you ever even played?? So here I am. Spreading hate."
عراسي
"in the 16 hours ive played this game the only thing that has consistently happened is getting kicked from squads and not being able to do anything in the game and god forbid you touch the wrong class or ""someone's"" vehicle or turret they will stop at nothing to get you removed or more often kicked from the server and the community just lets it happen with the notion who ever screams the loudest is right dont buy this game unless its on sale or you love not being able to play it"
ازعاج
Bad Game
Helicopter controls are crap...
"I would really love it if the game devs worked on making this game run better and optimising it. I have a better PC than most and my PC meets the recommended requirements, however with the settings on the lowest options and screen resolution on 100% the games performance for me is basically unplayable. I can't get more than 25 frames in the game when no one else is around. If I get in a gun fight CQB my game freezes, if there are too many explosions my game just crashes. I used to be able to run this game no problem, but now, my game stutters like crazy just on the main menu and can’t even run the game intro smoothly. I think this is easily the best realism game on the market now, however, unless you have a pc that is significantly better than the recommended requirements, don’t get it."
".,"
This game is so bland.
=
The game play is painfully slow to the point where it becomes boring.
"be happy in life, you don't need squad"
Fun game before they ruined it with the updates to the infantry and aiming mechanics. I had 700 hours in this game and instantly lost interest when they did the update. Truly a shame since it was such an amazing game.
"Servers are impossible to join. You start a queue at position 8 and end up at position 12, 30 minutes later. Most of the time squads aren't available to join so you're stuck as a solo squad lead. Ultra-wide often breaks sending you into an even wider aspect ratio and make it unable to change your screen type with F11."
"Most toxic and sweaty community in the world. You get kicked out of squads and servers for so little and get called names if you don't know every tiny part and detail of the game and maps or don't like getting micromanaged by kids who role play army. I have played this game for many years and the community just keeps getting worse. And if you say anything about it you get swarmed by fanboys. 

If you're looking to play something after work and have a fun and relaxing time with this is not for you."
100 soldiers with muscular astrophysics fight
Unfun and runs like ass
"Grown men whining because you dont listen to their commands. game 8.5/10, community 0/10"
"After returning to this game after more than a year-long pause, it seems the infantry overhaul has really broken the game. Now, you either play as a ""bush wookie"" or pray to hit with the spray. No person in the world swings their weapon around like these soldiers in the game. It has taken all the fun away. This is not the ""realistic combat""...."

"I used to really like this game, unfortunately it now crashes on me a lot. Can't get through a single match without a crash."
fat dad bad game
weapon sway sucks ass
bok gibi oyun. bozdular
got banned 5 minutes into a server for disrupting the chain of command when the squad leader asked if i had a mic. i was turning on my input device.
"I hate this game. I regret buying it. I wish I could refund it, but I spent so much time working around the glitches and doing the tutorials that I'm over the steam 2-hour refund limit. I should have skipped the tutorials so I could see how painful the game was to play before running out of refund time.

I spent a couple hours just doing the tutorials, during which the game crashed twice. Though the multiplayer mode didn't crash on me, I found it very frustrating, buggy, and unpolished.

Infantry:
This is the core of the game, and the most ""finished"" part. Join a squad, ride in a troop transport, (hopefully) dismount before making contact with enemy, then... play, I guess. Don't try to just walk/run/sprint to objectives from spawn. It's like 10x worse than Hell Let Loose for how long you have to run to get anywhere. Maps are HUGE. And you'll sprint for 20 minutes just to get randomly shot and killed without ever seeing your attacker. Sort of like DayZ.

Most guides suggest starting with rifleman or medic, with a scope. I tried medic. I was on voice comms with my squad and local, responding to orders, trying to coordinate, etc. But after hours of ""playing"" this game, I finally rage quit. It's just too frustrating. I play lots of Hell Let Loose and Insurgency, and I thought I understood the basics of cover, concealment, and flanking, but Squad makes me feel helpless. I go prone and try to sneak through shadows and shrubbery. So slowly.... then get killed randomly. I try sprinting between cover, and I get mowed down by machine guns. I move with the squad, use smoke, etc., and we all get destroyed. I almost never even see the enemy.

And there are no friendly markers. You have to know if you're looking at an enemy by the uniform. And most teams have green camo. You often have to know which side someone's on by slight differences in helmet shape. And you have to be so good at it that you can get a shot off before you're mowed down by way more experienced players. There is no Co-op PvE like in Insurgency. Just gotta ""get gud"" somehow. At some point, I just shot at anyone running towards me. I was medic, so I just apologized and revived them if it was a friendly.

After 8 hours of trying to learn to play the game, and not enjoying hardly any of it, I got killed by an enemy who sneaked up on me from behind while I was prone in the middle of nowhere in a forest. I assumed he was half a mile away, but my friend watching my steam stream actually saw the guy who shot me and screenshotted it. I was looking right at him and couldn't see. Combination of screen blurring because suppression, and his camo blending in.

And again, I see the usual bleeding out screen, complete with constant nauseating camera twitching for 300 seconds. And again, I'm yelling at the computer screen, saying ""My guy is supposed to be unconscious! Why does the camera always act like my character's having a seizure!?"" This game is supposed to be out of early access?

And the voice comms... They technically work, but squads are so big, and there are so many people talking all the time, it's very hard to communicate. And between matches, the game puts you into all-talk, where you get to hear 100 adults screaming like autistic children... every time. And I couldn't find a way to mute this madness.

I could probably spend 1,000 hours before I got even somewhat competant in this game. But I don't enjoy it at all.

Helicopter flight:
Don't buy this game for helicopter flight. The primary (and expected) method of control is keyboard+mouse. And it's terrible. You could also use a joystick, but only _one_ joystick. Maybe an xbox controller or an all-in-one cheap joystick with a throttle slider and twist axis. HOTAS is not supported, because this game (like most 1990's games) only supports one joystick. It combines all joystick inputs into one. To get around this, you need to install a combination of vJoy, Joystick Gremlin, and HID Hide, and learn how to set them up so Squad only sees one joystick. It's not fun. Oh, and TrackIR and other head tracking are not supported. The quick-look keys cause the screen to constantly flash, so they're useless. The recommended setup (according to Reddit) is to use hacks to set TrackIR to act as a mouse, and set mouse look to always on. A game that claims to not be in Early Access should not require all these hacks. And from what I understand, the helicopter controls have been this bad since about 2021, when they first introduced joystick control. They have a ""roadmap"" to fix it, but it's been 3 years.

Helicopter flight model is sort of like flying a brick, IMO. It doesn't seem to be reacting to air, just momentum. The exception is the air cushion effect when close to the ground, which seems to be modeled decently.

Helicopter gameplay on multiplayer amounts to someone making a locked squad and taking the helicopter, if there is one on the map. Not all maps get one.

If you want to have fun flying a helicopter, just get DCS, or even an old DOS game like Apache '95.

Vehicles:
Driving vehicles with keyboard is about on par with other first-person games, except for the motorcycle, which is very hard to control. Mouse-look is acceptable.

Most of my vehicle gameplay was joining a tank squad, riding as spotter, driving around for 15+ minutes, trading shots with enemy tank for 15 seconds, then blowing up. Kinda dull.

Some vehicles have a machine gun mounted on top. Most of the time, using this just gets you killed nearly instantly when an enemy shows up.

Graphics/sound:
Quite nice. Game runs at about 45-55fps on my RTX 3090 on the high setting. Setting it to medium and disabling antialiasing brings it up to almost 60fps. I appreciate that smoke grenades actually spray smoke instead of just having a generic smoke cloud appear. I appreciate the picture-in-picture scope view. I like the depth-of-field on iron sights. I like the look and feel when shooting through the wood floor in the tutorial. It feels like the wood is actually splintering. Graphics feels modern and realistic.

Conclusion: Many of the biggest issues have been there for years and may never get fixed. Buy it on sale if you like punishment. Otherwise, get an airsoft gun and play soldiers IRL. Many will just say ""get gud"". Yes, that's true. You can go spend 1,000 hours ""getting gud"". Maybe the game will even be fun for you then."
"Its too slow and they need to optimise the game i have a 3060 and sometimes im getting 20 fps on the lowest settings, the game is really difficult and when i scope or shoot i feel like throwing up it makes me dizzy they need to make it so that you can see who your teammates are and not make them all look the same"
"The keeps crashing, it is depressing. This game so good, but it just optimized for new PC build. I never had an issue with this game 1 year ago. At the time I had AMD everything and worked great. Now that I upgraded, I can not even run the game. It sad. So much potential."
Queue sim thanks to lack of matchmaking
crashing all the time
"This game was made by damn geniuses on LSD.
I still feel like I'm in an acid trip. I've never played such a fine brand of cocaine before. The latest update is just a piece of shit. Thank you OWI for killing your favorite game. I do not recommend buying!"
"I just returned to squad after a year and half hiatus.

can't aim, takes literally 5 min for the screen to become un-blurry after being suppressed for 1 second, running has somehow turned into powerwalking??  and forget trying to aim after just moving forward without ""running"" for a little while.

I target & comp shoot in real life with rifles and pistols and the ico or whatever it is they implemented no way reflects how it feels IRL, it is a really horrible system that just makes me extremely frustrated considering ik 70 year olds who can shoot on the move after running and hold it 10x steadier than how its portrayed in game. these arn't meant to be regular civies with no training in combat but actual trained infantry etc but the devs have seemed to make it so they have the discipline of a 8 yearold child trying to hold up a barret.

after holding out and hoping that after 7 games in a row it would get better, it has not. the game is unplayable for me, its a real shame that i cannot recommend this game to anyone, especially since it used to be my favourite tactical infantry shooter."
"IF you love to run around for hours only to be shot by someone you never see or has crazy good accuracy, This is the game for you. Its fun to be with people and try to go around and play as a group but the cheats are to obvious and no way to actually report cheaters. So basically a fun game until you are completely over the bullshit."
This ICO is terrible -1
Honestly a tad too messed up for my taste. Would appreciate some more thought to be put in the game.
"I'm far too antisocial for something that requires this much communication. I also found the controls too complex, never even got around to finishing the tutorial due to the amount of keys on the keyboard necessary to play. I'd need a flashcard with the controls taped to my screen to play this."
"infantry is shit, cant aim for nothing, was good when it had playable infantry but after the update i have a fucking soldier who has never held a gun in his life"
Personally I cant get into it unlike other war games. Community is hard to get along with and the game is just not as fun as arma or hell let loose.
game keeps crashing
"The game relies heavily on teamwork, and communication plays a big role. It's as much of a military role-playing game as it is a shooter. You'll need to find a proper community to enjoy this game, and pray that there's enough slots in the servers you enjoy. 

It's a very odd game, and I can't recommend it as it simply isn't fun without an active team - which is hard to find the majority of the time."
been multiple years yet they have not fixed the biggest issue wich is the horrible servers cant even join a game anymore server browser dosent work and pressing the play button or whatever it is dosent work devs cant make infantry good if their life depended on it.
roblox better
"I hate that my game character can barely handle a weapon after doing a light jog, its like they arent even trained to handle a gun."
They introduced a bug that does not allow your courser to lock to the game.
finding english is hard and u cant rely on yankie noodles to be good at the game. u need some single player or ranked modes
"With the changes to thee game over the past few months the game has started to feel like everything is against you. It genuinely feels like youre a child conscript thats never fired a weapon. Its somewhat sucked the enjoyment out of the game, a game i used to truely love. Bring back the old systems which were balanced and made sense for a game!"
"It's exactly the bf2 vibe I was searching for. However, crashes happen frequently. Unplayable. despite having 3050 Ti, i7 12-gen.
Since the game cannot be played, what is the purpose of buying it? Most of the players are facing this issue. They haven't fixed it yet. 
Because of the gameplay, I would most definitely suggest it. However, at this point, I just simply cannot."
"Absolutely terrible community. Joined a few beginner lobbies and got screamed at for not knowing what to do, and kicked from the squad for not doing exactly what the squad lead wanted 24/7. Was told to watch a few dozen hours of game-play and practice by myself for a few hours before trying to play online"
"ICO was nice in theory, optimization continually got worse over time, and now the game gives you more sway the lower your fps is. I.E if you have a firefight, or anything more than standing still shooting at eachother in an empty field, good luck hitting anything when your fps drops under 60 and suddenly your trained professional soldier is an intoxicated toddler trying to steady a triple pendulum to hit someone at 10 yards.

Why is scope sway tied to FPS? ask owi"
"I am applaud that the system requirements are straight up BS. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! MAKE SURE YOU SURPASS THE RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS. When the round starts I hit 80-90 FPS, then when you reach the objective sites my lord the frame rate takes a HUGE HIT. Stop misleading your customers Off world. Biggest waste of 30 bucks I have ever spent."
"4000 hours here
pros: nice community 
cons:
-huge ongoing controversy about gunplay and recoil affected by fps
-very bad performance issues on all hardware despite being an ancient game
-no destruction at all, nada, even tank shells dont' leave any marks
-aged graphics, no dynamic lightning
-lack of details and variety, most buildings are completely empty and are just boxes, 10 story buildings with all floors exactly the same
-bad vehicle physics will be a regular part of your gameplay, clumsy driving and stuck vehicles
-lots of unadressed bugs that players constantly face"
owi ruined this game with this stupid gunplay update it used to be fun leave it up to them to just completely f stuff up
The Gunplay is Horrible
"Its a nice game except the gunplay, its legit the worst.
 I dunno what kind of noodle arms my guy has but its embarrasing.
Since the gunplay is like the majoriry of the game i cant recommend it lol."
Worse version of Hell Let Loose
"I played Squad for years now, maybe more than half a decade or less, i forgot. and have had countless matches. At some point, I even no-lifed this game out of boredom. I like this game, because it reminds me of what PR could have been. However, I will never recommend getting this game in its current state.

1- Squad is heavily reliant on teamwork, communication and patience. Each match is determined by the SLs that guide their teammates and the careful placement of assets(HABs, vehicles and such). However, because of the new wave of new players, and the waves of veterans(players who played for a while) leaving, Squad currently has worse teamwork and communication than CSGO. Some servers will be better than others, but ultimately after a specific time has passed, only new players are left. People forget to give callouts, forget how to place a hab, forget how to defend or how to attack. People misuse vehicles and their purposes, and leave 1-1.5hr matches being a frustrating, chaotic mess. 

2-Armor squads. I just hate them, an elitist group of people who think they are better than others, with the most arrogant, narcissistic personalities. Some of them are cool, depending on what server, and some of them are just too voodoo for this. I fucking hate buji too.

3-Chinese faction and how OP it is compared to the rest. Theres no denying that there is bias, like how the Chinese ATGM can reload faster than all other tows, or how the ZTZ has the tiniest weakspots, or how the Chinese HAT kit has a laser rangefinder and multipurpose ammunition. The Chinese amphibious logi has the most capacity in game, and their vehicles are the smoothest to control. Their APCs are tanky, and in some layers they have more vehicles than others.

4-Faction voting. It is possibly the worst thing second to the ICO. Players now only choose armor factions, and it always becomes a formula of (TANK V TANK, TANK V SUPPORT). Or, players only choose meta factions, like USMC v VDV or USA v RUS.. Rarely do players choose insurgent, or militia, or other factions. Always meta armor factions. This is of course subjective to servers, but I digress. 

5- ICO. ICO has ruined it all for me, and has made the game an RNG shooter. People will argue to just wait and shoot, but even if I do, hitting the enemy will not always kill them. People are still bullet sponges, and the inability to hit straight has made firefights ever so random, and ever so frustrating. At some times, I have hip fired people from point blank, and because of the randomness of the shooting, my bullets quite literally went everywhere but the intended target. The suppression system is fine, but the way everything else plays out makes this game a chaotic mess. Add this with the new wave of players, and you have a chaotic game, chaotic command chat, misplaced HABs and you dont even get the ability to fight back properly. No way do weapons behave like this in real life, and this isnt even an attempt to make firefights realistic, it is an attempt to sabotage years of playing to give way to new players. While yes, players shouldnt be able to hit a moving target consistently at 200-300m, they should atleast be able to do that at 50-100m! But people cant, because the way is random, and unbearable. There is even evidence to suggest that the less framerates, the more sway you get. SO, people with beast PCs will always outplay others, because of less sway. 

7-Game physics. Cars will fly, or flip on the smallest bumps. Tanks will bounce when hitting rocks, and flip upside down. Cars drift around in the desert, as if there isnt friction. Cars or tanks cant climb hills, as if torque doesnt exist.

8-OWI does not care. And yes, I am calling out the company out of frustration, but OWI has fumbled it by trying to get more buyers than to keep a dedicated community. We have lost hundreds or thousands of players purely because of greed and because of mismanagement. We have lost a dedicated community of veterans who put years into this game, and for what? For a few clicks? Content creators will swear that the game is doing better than it was, and it is a LIE. The game is in a worse state, and it needs better work. It needs to revert some changes, or heavily change them. 

Overall, the game currently is as it goes: Matches are a chaotic mess of miscommunication, misplacement of assets, new players unable to form a coherent force, and a gunplay system that is based on a coin flip.
I will keep playing this game, because i like it and want to see it become better, but it has been a decline since V12 and things appear to be the same for the foreseeable future.

Also, armor players are liars. You dont need a beast PC to claim vehicles, you just need to do:
CreateSquad ""squadname"" 1
Good luck."
this shit is garbage lmao
"-Team kill because you cant figure out who is enemy
-Get screamed at
-Yell back
-Get kicked
-Play another game
-Die over and over because everyone looks the same and you have no clue who is on your team
-Never with squad since they keep abandoning me
-Uninstall"
Somehow I got same vibes again than years ago. I guess its stolen project and even modified so badly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR9wHeI8010
"Worst combat game i have ever played. Its way too hard, annoying to have to run for 30 min, never hit a single shot because the crossair is moving constantly. And now since i have played the entire weekend i CANNOT FUCKING RETURN IT. Worst 40 dollar waste EVER!"
star wars mod cool game bad
game is fuckin gay and for niggers
A lot of Russians
IDK what the fuck these devs were thinking drastically changing a game thats been out for so long... Gunplay isnt even a slight bit satisfying anymore. they force you too lay prone and not advance they just took their vision and ruined a game just like all these arrogant devs that dont listen to their communities.
I want to love it but its bugged and poorly optimized. Also hardly anyone wants to work together like intended.
"game feels clunky, doesn't run all that well and the gun play is horrible. takes forever for your character to aim straight. gameplay is pretty boring in general. if you're unlucky you're stuck in a squad thats just camping somewhere for 20 mins. realistic? maybe. boring? yes."
"I just learned that there is a bug in the game that makes your aim much harder if your FPS is low. I'm playing on an old computer and thought that I was getting killed a lot because I was not skilled, but now I know that it's mostly because the other players have an extreme and disproportionate advantage due to their more expensive hardware.

This is also the reason why some players hated the infantry combat update, and some loved it. It gave unfair advantages to some, and unfair disadvantages to the rest.

This problem is caused by the unfortunate tendency of game devs developing on extremely high performance hardware, and as such will not detect bugs they introduce on a typical user's machine.

EDIT: They eventually fixed the FPS bug, but there are so many other bugs that I cannot recommend this game. The devs don't seem to be able to fix one issue without causing two other issues. The ICO update which created the FPS sway bug was supposed to prevent people from doing weird non-immersive things like ""jiggly-peeking"" and 360 noscope headshots like you see in other unrealistic shooters, but it didn't even fix that because you can still jiggly peek, standing upright, from behind a tree and shoot someone who is lying down 150 meters away from you, pinning you down. Maybe some other dev team will be able to fix this age-old issue with shooters."
"It was good until it got fucked into oblivion with the ""ICO"" AKA Infantry Combat Overhaul. And by overhaul they made soldiers handle recoil worse than a 5 year old. 
The die hards who couldn't even aim in the first place will cry ""Skill Issue"" as though that's somehow relevant to the fact that, you can't fire 3 bullets, without your gun almost fish tailing out of your hands.
I had a lot of fun with the game, but now it's just unfun garbage."
pice of shit game
"As an experienced player of ""Squad"" on Steam, I've had the opportunity to delve deep into the intricacies of this tactical shooter. Developed by Offworld Industries, Squad is a first-person shooter that places a heavy emphasis on teamwork, communication, and realistic military tactics. Having spent countless hours immersed in its intense and demanding gameplay, I can confidently say that Squad stands out in the crowded FPS market for its commitment to authenticity and its ability to deliver a truly collaborative experience.

Realism and Immersion

One of the first things that struck me about Squad is its dedication to realism. The graphics are stunning, with detailed environments ranging from dense forests to sprawling urban landscapes. The sound design is equally impressive, capturing the cacophony of battle with precision. Bullets whiz past your ears, explosions rock the terrain, and the distant chatter of your squadmates on the radio all contribute to an unparalleled level of immersion.

The gameplay mechanics are meticulously crafted to mirror real-world military operations. Movement is deliberate and weighty, making every action feel consequential. This game does not cater to lone wolves; success hinges on effective communication and coordination with your team. The learning curve is steep, but it's this challenge that makes each victory so rewarding.

Teamwork and Communication

The essence of Squad lies in its emphasis on teamwork. Each match consists of two teams, each with up to 50 players, working together to achieve their objectives. Within these teams, players are divided into smaller squads, each led by a squad leader who coordinates with other squads and the overall team commander. This hierarchical structure fosters a sense of organization and strategy that is rarely seen in other FPS games.

Communication is vital. The game features an in-game voice chat system that includes squad chat, local chat, and command chat, allowing for seamless communication at all levels of the team. The need for constant communication ensures that players are always engaged and working together. Whether calling out enemy positions, coordinating an assault, or requesting supplies, every voice counts. As someone who enjoys the strategic depth of military operations, this aspect of Squad is incredibly satisfying.

Strategic Depth

Squad's strategic depth is what keeps me coming back. The game features a wide array of vehicles, from transport trucks to armored tanks, each requiring a coordinated effort to operate effectively. Building and maintaining forward operating bases (FOBs) is another key aspect of gameplay, adding a layer of logistical strategy. The maps are vast and varied, offering numerous tactical possibilities and encouraging players to think critically about their approach to each objective.

The game constantly challenges you to adapt and refine your strategies. Whether you’re planning a stealthy infiltration, setting up ambushes, or managing resources for your squad, the strategic elements of Squad keep the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Community and Updates

The community in Squad is one of its strongest assets. Players are generally cooperative and willing to teach newcomers the ropes. This welcoming atmosphere is a testament to the game's design, which rewards teamwork and punishes selfish playstyles. Offworld Industries also deserves praise for their commitment to supporting and expanding the game. Regular updates introduce new content, balance changes, and bug fixes, ensuring that Squad continues to evolve and improve.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Squad is a standout title in the tactical shooter genre. Its commitment to realism, emphasis on teamwork, and strategic depth make it a must-play for fans of military simulations. As a seasoned player, I find the game’s rewarding and immersive experience well worth the effort. For those seeking a game that challenges their tactical thinking and teamwork skills, Squad on Steam is an excellent choice. However, it’s important to note that recent changes to the gun mechanics have been disappointing. The shooting mechanics used to be much better, and this downgrade has significantly impacted my enjoyment of the game. Because of this, I have to give Squad a negative review. The developers need to address these issues to restore the game's former glory."
"Man I really used to love this game. The community is actually pretty great, gameplay is beyond fun. It looks gorgeous, and the sound scape and suppression system is another level. But I just cant stand these PiP scopes with the new combat overhaul. The game used to run so smooth and now it feels pretty janky most of the time, and adjusting my settings doesn't seem to help much. A 5950x and 3070ti should still be enough. Seems the devs have tried to add too much into the game without optimizing it properly. Right now, Squad44 seems to scratch the itch a lot better if i can get into a match. So i'm glad they are putting effort into that title. They need to go back to their roots with this game for me to recommend it anymore."
"Typical modern military shooter, oversized install size, terrible net code and broken promises. Cash shop is of course the only thing that runs at a decent frame rate."
game needs optimisation
"I would like to recommend the game but can't. 
It's command-base PvP but many players play it like BF or CoD.
When squads really communicate you really enjoy. But it happens very rare"
"Poorly implemented good idea - toxic community (big surprise) - Basic training doesn't provide enough of a tutorial to navigate the game mechanics in it's entirety - get ready to be amazed by the realism of not knowing what the fuck you're doing on a battlefield.  Played for 10 hours, never once understood how I died.  People using terms and phrases that aren't explained unless you ask and then people get upset when they have to explain.  What would make this game fun?  Single player mode."
10/10
trash optimization
Game is wack. Toxic wannabe sargent players make it worse. Rather play Battlefield or Arma.
"I REALLY want to love this game! its such a good mass warfare style game. the main problems I have with it are the PING system, why on earth not everyone can make pings is INSANE to me, now the first argument to that is ""the map will be covered"" well make them squad only pings and then SL pings, not hard to do, but the fact that I HAVE to make fire-team leaders so they can ping things is again INSANE, as infantry its AWESOME{/S} that i have to yell ""over there, like 275, next to that rock"" is fucking crazy... instead of just a single ping that fades withing 5 to 15 seconds. like what the actual fuck. second thing is the name badges, or icons above friendlies heads. who thought it was a good idea to have them show for .05s and then disappear again is fucking crazy, I spent so much mental effort making sure I see an actual enemy compared to a friendly it makes me not even want to play, It's hard enough to see the enemy now i have to double check they are in fact the enemy. why not have perm icons or at least show up BRIGHT when i literally AIM at a friendly is fucking crazy... hell let loose does this perfectly and doesn't detract from game play whatsoever.. those are 2 things I would LOVE address and make this a more enjoyable experience."
This fkin game is crashing every 10-15 minutes. Tried every possible fix and nothing works. Fck this broke ass game.
"I wish the developers could change the game engine, the current engine is out of date and bugs caused by the engine are all over the game. 

We need a better engine so the vehicles won't be flipped at the very start of the game, a tree won't be completely fine after a 70 ton MBT crash on it, the terrain won't remain the same after being bombed by heavy artillery fire. And most importantly, the leaves and textures won't be flashing, killing my eyes and GPU. 

We need enhanced graphics performance, more realistic physics engine and better optimization."
"post ICO squad = juice not worth the squeeze.  Old good squad is dead, go play another shooter.  The player base here is just as brain dead post ICO as it was pre ICO.  just now all the good players left."
Worst fucking game ever cant even play tries to join a squad and they all just kick you cause there to busy kissing each other then tries to make your own and get told fucking no not to mention the gunplay is the worst ive ever fucking seen
"I've been playing Squad for a while now (nearly 400 hours), and there are some standout aspects that I really appreciate. The emphasis on teamwork and communication is where this game truly shines. Every match requires coordination and strategy, making it a fantastic experience for those who enjoy working closely with their team. The game's design encourages players to communicate and cooperate, which leads to a sense of camaraderie and shared accomplishment that few other games can match.

However, when it comes to the gunplay, Squad falls short of my expectations. The mechanics feel clunky and lack the realism one would expect from a military simulation game. The shooting experience doesn't have the weight and precision that you find in other games within the genre, which can be quite frustrating, especially during intense firefights.

In summary, if you value teamwork and communication in your gaming experience, Squad is definitely worth trying. Just be prepared for a less-than-realistic gunplay experience that might detract from the overall immersion"
only cucks play this game...
i dont have sound for the game i heave tried diffrent thangs and sound will come on for a match then go back out.
"Old gunplay was wayyyyyyy better.

A 8 year old could handle a ar better then these ""Trained Operators""

Waste Of Money"
had to uninstall. not as fun
Picture in picture scopes look cool but absolutely tank your frames. Really really stupid.
Scope update blows.
This is easily one of the worst fps games I have ever played.
The modded servers with Russia against Ukrainians and islam  vs Israel is steadly ruining this game. Its dumping politics and so much hate speech into the game that I just want to enjoy. I get it there are world conflicts being portrayed but I would love to stop hearing about how everyone wants to kill jews. Its game for gods sake and more and more servers are just this.
gunplay is just bad using anything like rpg is ganne take 5 seconds so if a bmp is rushing you well youre fucked vechile combat is even more boring game consist of dying to somthing you dint see or somthing you cant stop
keeps crashing ue4 error every time i trie and load into a game but is fine in the main menu
"You are a trained soldier yet can only run for 3 seconds, slow as hell, and when you try to ADS your bones are like rubber. Full auto is somehow more accurate and when dumping a full mag into someone you die."
"ICO killed the game, worst gunplay ever after the freaking update"
"Game uses Easy Anti Cheat that creates problems on top of an already buggy and broken server browser. Seems like it doesn't cause issues for some people, but breaks the game for others like me. Unless you want to roll the dice to see if the game will permanently break for you, steer clear."
"The game feels terrible to play, movement and gunplay always feels like ass, and most servers boil down to ""run for 10 minutes, die to a guy you couldn't see, repeat.""
Partly skill issue sure- but HLL & Battle-bit both at least make it fun in their own ways. Not to mention the hundred other small pains the game has."
"Great game if you're in to tactical shooters. Too bada it's so badly optimized that it's have become a meme in the community. You wan't to play with 60+ fps stable? Just forget it, the game turns in to a slide show when ever it feels like it... Sometimes it works allright and other times you can't play at all."
"cant hit 60fps on this games with a 2080 after the ICO. Dont buy this shitty game unless you want your character to sway their gun for 10 seconds before being able to stabalize and take an accurate shot. Fucking noodle arms. And dont remind me of how shit they have made the stamina. You run for 10 seconds, you recover for 20. Pathetic game unless you have a 40 series card ffs"
meh
lowkey it says 80-90 gig download but that shit like 150 gigs at least lmao literally just deleted every game to download it and it used over 160 gigs and i have 40 gigs left and it still does not run lol not worth dont buy dlc are like 30gigs each too only buy if you got a terribite at least
"I never used to play squad as a run and gun, snap shooting game but the ICO has made infantry effectiveness terrible. Having trained soldiers that cant hold a gun steady to quite literally save their life after a 10 second run to cover is just stupid. Even with full stamina playing slowly, if you come face to face with an enemy the gunfight is just pure luck as to who's shots are going to land due to the fact that if you aim down sight your retical isnt even in the picture after the 2nd or 3rd shot and the hipfire accuracy is abysmal. Only time i have fun with infantry now is with MG's or marksmen where you can overwatch with a bipod so you can take effective shots without your gun going all over the place. If you contest any of the ICO changes you're told its a skill issue or ""go play COD"", overall i still play the game consistently because i love the teamwork and community play style even with the terrible game optimization but major changes need to be made to infantry to make it even somewhat viable without having to just meat grind your way onto objectives. OWI needs to listen to their community instead of bribing positive reviews and adding unnecessary micro transactions."
I am not good at it
"The game died when v5 ended. The insane suppression, inertia, physical inability of the players character and lack of any devs with military experience has led to a walking suppression simulator which is completely unplayable and neither realistic or functional compared to its previous renditions. Turns out that v6 is what killed this game off. You cant even hold the scope still with a bipod and in the prone ffs. All it takes is one vehicle with a 50 cal to make an entire compound unplayable for those defending it. Oh and they think 120mm mortar makes the ground have a 5 magnitude earthquake from 300+m away..."
Not bringing ranking system kills the game mentality and ruins whole game because of Squad Leaders that have no idea what they are doing.
You are playing as young military boy with noodle arms. Gunfire gameplay is just garbage.
"Really hard game to get into, complex and many players don't want noobs in their squads so hard to get into it....

Much more fun watching videos on YT of it than playing it..."
Hostile player base.
"Do not waste your money,I asked for a refund and told since I played it more then 2 hrs no refund. This is after multiple times sending crash reports from day one to them. I was able to get on one server one time for 15 min. More then 2 hrs on training is what they are talking about and I'm sure they see that."
not that good
Can not aim or shoot to much sensitivity. Fix the game! Combat Overhaul update ruined the game.
This game is so brain numbing it's crazy low-key a waste of 50 Euros
Can`t play the Taliban. shit game
No
"it has still some technical issue ,"
"After years of loving this game. All has been undone with the Infantry Combat Overhaul update.  Since the patch I have found myself not able to like playing the game how i used to. The slow nature of the game has been brought to a new level of slow encouraging a play style I simply do not like.  I understand that they love realism. But its just taken a little too far and takes away from the experience. Not being able to simply aim down your weapon and attempt to shoot someone after walking for 5 minutes in a shooter is an actual piss take. Once a beloved game now will sit uninstalled in my library until changes are made. Please revert the combat overhaul, or at the very least the ADS changes."
does anyone else have the problem of endless loading while trying to boot up the game. haven't even been able to play the game yet.
Infantry Combat Overhaul making it so your character can't keep a rifle steady on a man-sized target at 25m is asinine. I understand wanting to make the game slower but having a wacky wavy inflatable arm tube man as a trained soldier is absolutely ridiculous.
Wont work with Bluetooth headsets and the UI for maps and squad leaders is terrible
this used to be the best fps on the market by a country mile. But now is filled with hackers or people who have a 3090 outputting 720p quality so they can see you move in a bush that is not on their screen. let alone the amount of children or just plain dumb people who play this game without a mic or look to wonder around like its a open world adventure game.
british people have rights on this
"noone wants to squad lead and constantly squad seed leaving new players as SL who don't even want it or know how to play it. Community is subpar, tbh."
You can not tell who is who until you learn all of the uniforms this sucks because most engagements happen at long range. Slow pace with no rewards or feedback when  you kill an enemy or revive friendly. Fun community but terrible game design outside of the mechanics.  Not a good came for casual gamer.
A large problem with this game is the community. extremely toxic community and most importantly toxic mods
"This game use to be soo good but i feel like the ruined it a few updates ago. The hip fire was never good in this game, but now scoping in with any type of optic takes forever and is extremely blurry. Whatever they did to the ADS and optics ruined the combat experience in my opinion. A couple years ago it was much better"
This game failes to work with xbox headset microphone when audio communication is core gameplay necessity. Bug is long known but newer fixed.
very bad stuttering and fps issues
"I cannot recommend the game at its curent state. 
Have been playing this game for a little over six years now and accumulated 2600+ hours in game.
Still wish Operation First Light would be in the game...

The ""recent"" Infantry Combat Overhaul really - REALLY - destroyed the game for me.
It favours bush wookies instead of aggresive infantry gameplay. It's not tactical, it's just lame.
It's a game at the end of the day and it should be fun. Squad is NOT milsim like Arma and it shouldn't try to be.
It's infuriating sprinting for 10 seconds and having to wait another 10 until your character's noodle arms stop swinging like a freaking car dealership air dancer. Eventually you take the shot but even if it's a headshot there's a 50% the enemy will survive.

Also removing the dead-dead status some years ago was a bad decision imo. It just encourages players to run around like headless chickens without fearing for punishment for doing so. Now THAT was much better at slowing down the game's pace without that noodle arm bullcrap.

Now whoever's been playing this game know optimization is just terrible. It still feels like an early access game, although it's being developed for almost 10 years now.
Game also doesn't look great. Some maps have been revamped (aka added some bushes and trees) and are kinda ok, but after a while they tend to get repetitive. 

There are a couple good things about the ""game"":
1. Its community. There are several clans that have been around for ages now and without them populating the servers the game would've been dead by now. 
2. The mods created by said community. Some mods allow you to play with the ""old"" infantry mechanics so you can actually have fun. Through what were originally mods, new factions, vehicles, guns have been added to the game. Don't think OWI would've ever come that far without these mods.

This game is only still around because there is no competition at the moment.
I hope that changes soon, same as happened to Tarkov with Gray Zone and Arena Breakout."
I don't understand why this game is so popular; is it because all the other games suck more?
very slow paced game
textures doesn't load properly
no
"Kinda runs like actual shit, they fixed some of the issues but one guy tosses a smoke or something blows up and even on a next gen rig ur fps dumps, stupid asf, optimize your goddamn game"
its not good
i dont know who is mine teammate...bade game. rip
Do not buy this game unless you have a 10K computer to run it. Even the game looks horrible on DLSS mode or even having the anti aliasing on. I don't know what the developers have been smoking the past few months that I was off from this game. But my god is the game unplayable.
Need to be a pro gamer to enjoy this game
"You play like a toddler with a gun with the aim and recoil.
Global escalation mod helps but it's a 50/50 if you get an incompetent team or half the tickets being drained by friendly fire."
"Game used to be good a year ago, when it was a little more arcady, the developers are wrongfuly going into a super realistic milsim direction guided by a very loud minority part of the community, taking all the fun the game used to have, i don't want to be opening my map to check if someone is a foe or not, and i don't want to memorize every faction's camo, this is becoming a running simulator and team kill simulator instead of an actual war game."
I GOT FUCKING BANNED FOR TEAMKILLING
optimization
no
"Buyer beware, if your looking for a way to waste two hours of your life, have little to poor piss communication, to players griefing, trolling, or even hacking, with server admins being to non existing, and with no teamwork that the game is solely about. Then you have found the right game to waste your money and to give devs money that they never will use to work on the game. Welcome to the squad, get your refund back within the steam policy to get your money back."
strict no fun policy
"Подавление хуета конченная, неиграбельно"
"Fix optimization and I will change my vote. Helldivers 2 community did it, we can too. 
This is for the benefit of the players and for the game. I love it, but I must do it."
Dogshit ass community lol don't waste your time
unrealistic mechanics and waste of money
"Bought the game couple of years ago and finally gave it a go

Stamina is very punishing and gun handling is very atrocious

As if the dev team wanted to make a milsim but had zero clue so they just dumped whatever idea they had without any balancing

I don't recommend Squad to anyone unless you like to stare at shaky trash which you could find free trash and shake it in front of your face without having to pay for anything"
only buy if u dont care about getting 40 fps
"BAD OPTIMIZATION!!! SHOULD GAIN MORE FPS ON LOW VIDEO AND FOV
CANT SEE ALLY OR ENEMIES AT ALL!!!!  u dont know who is who.
Should have hover and instantly show player's name with out delaying animation"
"Good game, fun to play, and intensive gameplay. Problems? Squad leader acts like a baby and kicks you out without any reason or if you choose their favorite kit. They are brainless crying kids who cant play with the selected kit. And the game does not allow you to play without being in a squad which is even dumbest thing in this game. Add bot support for single player mode like you did for Project Reality"
add sex pls
Obligatory bad review for trading screenshots for good reviews lol wtf does anyone want screenshots for
Offworld has ruined this game with the new team and map voting!!
хуета для долбаёбов
"The infantry overhaul really crushed this game.

I understand their intent but after giving it more than a few hours since the change it is safe to say it did not achieve its desired effect. Instead of changing infantry behavior it has caused the player base to abandon infantry in favor of armor or air assets.

Can no longer recommend this game to my friends and rarely find myself playing anything other than the community mods.

They really shot themselves in the foot with this one."
worlds worst gunplay award goes to squad now!
"servers are too sensitive, if you write ""nades in this game are retarded"" you will get banned...how sensitive the world has become...dont be a pussy"
aint no way anyone plays this and enjoys it by far worst game i have ever played. Names of the players dont show or barely show. The enemy sees you wellllllllll before you see them even when scouting and looking through binos full scan of the area you still get killed while being concealed. the mechanics suck ass. feels like i fill them with lead at head and chest shots and they dont drop im shot one time and im instantly kia
Meh. The game could be fun at times and very boring other times. Good servers are full and bad ones are not fun and full of people not taking the game seriously. I haven't played this in a long time simply because of long waiting times in servers around my location.
Ever since they changed the aiming mechanics game is clunky and bad... so sad
not worth it keeps crashing
lame ass game
Game has unacceptably poor optimization. Can barely hit 30 FPS on some maps with a 3060ti on low.
awful game
Got highs of 8 FPS lows of 1 and normal range of 3-5. What.
"[h1][b]""Squad: Ambitious Tactics Marred by Community Management""[/b][/h1]

[h2][b]Overall Score: 40 Cans of Horse Meat[/b][/h2]

[h2]Introduction[/h2]
Squad aims to revolutionize the tactical shooter genre with its 100-player battles featuring modern weaponry and complex team strategies. As I navigate the battlefield of this review, let’s be clear—I am as straightforward in my judgments as the game is ambitious in its design.

[h2]Graphics - 6 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: The visuals in Squad are competent, supporting the immersion of a modern combat environment. However, the recent updates have introduced control issues that detract from the experience, tipping the balance unfavorably for players who adhere to the rules.

[h2]Gameplay - 3 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: While Squad’s gameplay promises complex coordination and large-scale battles, the clunky mechanics and recent control issues significantly undermine its playability. This reduction reflects the growing frustration among players.

[h2]Sound/Music - 7 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: The sound design is a strong point, with realistic audio cues that enhance tactical decisions and add depth to the combat experience.

[h2]Replayability - 3 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: The potential for varied and dynamic gameplay is overshadowed by pervasive issues with community management and server inconsistency, severely affecting the desire to replay.

[h2]Performance - 4 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: Performance varies significantly across different servers, particularly due to unofficial modifications that can impact gameplay smoothness and fairness.

[h2]Content Volume - 4 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: While Squad offers a variety of maps and units, the actual enjoyment of this content is frequently compromised by the game’s broader issues, reducing its overall appeal.

[h2]Multiplayer - 3 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: Although multiplayer is the core of Squad, the experience is marred by a lack of official servers and the problematic behavior of certain server admins. The existence of a blacklist controlled by these admins creates an oppressive environment where fairness is often disregarded.

[h2]Innovation - 8 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: The game’s concept and scale are highly innovative, attempting to set a new standard in tactical gameplay. However, the execution is flawed, particularly in how the community is managed.

[h2]Value for Money - 2 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: Given the potential frustration and barriers to consistent enjoyment caused by community management issues, the game might not represent good value for all players, especially those unwilling to navigate the complexities of its multiplayer environment.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
With an overall score of 40 cans of horse meat, Squad offers a glimpse of what could be a revolutionary step in tactical shooters but ultimately falls short due to significant community management issues. The game demands not only tactical skill but also a high tolerance for community-driven governance, which can detract from the overall experience. As I end this review, I stand as committed to fair play and honest critique as I am clear about my own orientation—firmly not gay."
Explicably unpopular. Even after seeing what it has to offer
"A very slow paced, clunky and boring shooter."
"Gunplay and movement are terrible, you're constantly struggling to keep your crosshair where you want it to be. Older and therefore slower gamers love this because it adds ""realism"" and gives them a chance against more skillful aimers. You have to be prone in a bush for 15 seconds for your aim to stabilize. If you like this, I can recommend this game, but for me its the worst part of it."
What a waste of money for a run until you get shot simulator. this isnt milsim so stop trying so hard to be so.
"This game is somehow too realistic to be a fun casual shooter experience, but also not realistic enough to make for a complex and engaging simulator game. It's weird."
game updates and i cant play it when it was working fine before the update
"leans too much towards simulation for my tastes.  The maps are very large, takes a while to get where you are going and your enemy encounters are few and far between.  When you do make contact it is almost always from great distances, leaving you to squint while shooting at little tiny soldiers through your scope that are only a couple of pixels in size.  More likely than not you'll get shot before you see anybody no matter what you do.  I don't see the appeal."
was good before
"Realistic war styled shooter done nicely, might be a bit slow and clunky in some part but overall nice TEAM (squad) player game.
Now then, remember that ""TEAM""(squad) part? yeah thats 80% of the time some bullshit and i mean bullshit like the whole shit bag out of that poor ass bull. Private servers hooray! what a shit-fest... youll basically enter a game just to see 5 - 9 locked squads cause fuck it why play and allow TEAM play in TEAM game - also... private servers setup just allow that even more... sweaty ass-fingered admins are as usefull as my right nut and boy does it hang low. 
All those private servers, discord servers, admins in a team based game... are amounting to a perfect 0...
Nice concept of a game, execution ruined by community.

"uniforms for both teams tend to be almost exactly the same and its very hard to distinguish between your team and the others. Players have a constant discussion about gay tendencies. Squad leads don't have tolerance for beginners and ask if you can find another squad, They honestly believe this to be real and not just a game. Got a refund."
this game is so fun but its unplayable bc of how broken the game is dont buy this pos. FIX YOUR SHIT
too many bugs yet n is extremely hard. inputs are way too lagish
my friends like it
Queue simulator
Unoptimized game.
"The game has a lot of bugs. Also, players cannot make a squad before the game starts. Do not support Steam friends.
Do not support training with teammates. Cant change FOV when a player is a helicopter pilot. You can't mute the plyaers in a lobby after the match is over. There was a small part problesm it this game."
"Fos drops and stuttering, im done"
Leak this Hoss.
this game is boring play arma instead
"Saw that they were bribing people for positive reviews here so this is my first review of the game:

Yikes"
"The best part about the game is its game speed and match flow. Very rewarding to sit back and take your time with your team and pick off randoms that dont work together (if played slow and tactical). Teamwork is very balanced. Great suppression mechanics. Good amount of vehicles although missing a lot of tactics and strategy that is used with modern technology. (press w with boots or wheels and commander gets a UAV and Arty every 20 mins); vanilla tactics. 

The worst part about the game is that grass unrenders after 300 meters so defenders can see attackers clear as day, but attackers cant see 2 feet in front of them when prone. Community combat awareness IQ is very low and hurts the experience even for someone who is mildly trying to play (Find friends for consistent enjoyment). No building destruction. Lack of player movement ability (cant peak over cover have to stand and expose oneself...) Graphics are very hard to look at when there is a lot of foilage. Player seems to stick to trees and building if you rub up against them. Not uncommon for player and vehicles to get stuck inside of a tree (vics have a low chance of getting out of them, players can prone spam out). Major flaws hurt it alot. Still traces of being a beta.

Personal Remarks: Adding the ability to dig into the ground and alter brush/foilage with e tool (also lack of thick brush, all bushes on all maps have same spacing). Commander needs more strategical things to do. 100v100 someday? 50v50 is unrealistic personel for the size of some of the maps. Provide more structure to the organization of teams. When making a squad, allow leaders to mark there squad as ""logi"" or ""recon"" or ""transport"" or ""QRF"". Open players eyes about the possibilities in-game instead of on the loading screen. Free will is only good when players know what they can do with it.

Finally there should be an accolade system of some sort. Militaries all over the world are all about giving medals and ribbons. Incentivize the player to play well, theres no positive reinforcement for good play and i think that is what ruins matches sometimes... nobody cares. Maybe since a player stays within a 400ish meter radius of their squad leader they have a good rating in that catagory that adds up to an overall rating. Maybe somones profile just has a type of Medal of Honor for that faction they were playing when they earned it because the game can track them pulling multiple downed teammates away from a burning logi truck under suppression or a squad leader is 9v37 in a certain grid square with his green triangles for 10 minutes because he understands how to win in battle. Thats what I would like to see. When I get on this game all i see is my 2k hours played and nothing in game to show for it. Promote good play!"
Infantry combat overhaul made this so much less fun to play. They made shooting guns a struggle and your character sucks at aiming. If you see someone you better be ready to wait 20 seconds before you aim to regain stamina
cheap arma clone
The old aiming system was better and why are weapon skins and emotes in a milsim?
Not my style tbh
"not recomended for indonesian player, cuz there arnt many server available"
"Infantry overhaul made this game so entirely not fun to play, might come back if they roll it back or someone mods it into its previous state"
"Terrible gun mechanics after the latest ADS and recoil change, you're better off playing Arma."
"Military role play X
Stupid pp and low IQ / game sense pp role play  O"
Really boring and graphics arent as good as i thought they might be.  This is an opinion
"fun game but the performance is something that really bugs me, alot"
the physics engine in this game is complete crap. I advise the developers of this mess to go back to school
ICO is meh
Game keeps fucking crashing and the devs are bribing people for positive reviews. I honestly only play this game for galactic contention.
Game was great until I heard an NZ accent over the radio. Uninstalled.
Recent updates have made the game too slow and not fun to play anymore. Everyone has left. Come back when they fix it.
Players get way into role play that they will kick you from squads if you don't listen
ew
"I know this is more like me issue, but the game often crash, either that or the game wont render correctly, the texture looks like a playdough. when the game launch correctly, i spend most time just looking for a server, and waiting on the queue. if you are a european or american, have decent pc, and enjoy milsim game, this is for you. you got no probs. if you are south east asian, dont have decent pc, nope better upgrade first before buying it. i mean, idk man my pc is not even that bad."
GAME JANCOK GAME IKI TERLALU REALISTIS SAMPEK GARAI MOTO PICEK POKOK GAME TAEK IKI ISI E YO TAEK
"Game started going down hill after they started catering to the hardcore community. Wavey noodle arms is not a realistic way to induce suppression. I wish they just did screen effects like the black pin hole or the blurred screen for suppression, instead when you round a corner to an enemy you get to experience the most hilarious gun fighting mechanics in a multiplayer game ever. I wish they would just tone down the noodle arm effect by like 40% and then it would be all better. 

Wish they allowed servers to take out ICO and revert it back a year or two before they started catering to the hardcore mil-sim kids. Some of us just want casual enter a game and not experience dumb mechanics which pretty much split the community into 2."
only reaally pplay with freind
"Clunky, unsmooth movement, weak graphics. I do not recommend."
the game still crash every time i played
"Das Spiel stürzt mindestens jedes 2x Game ab, einfach aus dem Nichts."

"Every time they update this game you roll a dice on whether or not your system will be able to run it or not, unfortunately this most recent update has bricked up my pc."
monkaTOS
Most idiotic way to make a game. Hell let loose much better.
"The servers are mainly hosted by discord groups which is great. But, the servers all suck. Either there is 30 people there. Which makes it kinda hell. Or there is less than 8 people in a lobby basically meaning 1-2 people are playing on your team. 2-3 on the enemy team. While the rest are AFK."
"Not a great game. Gameplay wise this is a game that wants to be ""Hyper realistic"" but fails in doing so. Shooting is overblown and over exaggerated, the optics travel slower than the line of sight causing you to look in one direction and the optic and gun move to that location slowly, like you're using your arms then moving your head instead of you're torso, it then has to much inertia and flies out to the side before coming back in. 
Stamina has improved slightly, you can now run like a modern untrained man carrying 60lbs of gear. However the arms shaking like noodles in an earthquake is not realistic, make it impossible to aim at half or less stamina"
тупо черный екран и бесконечная загрузка
"R9 6900HS ,RX 6700S, 32Gb RAM - Low settings 30-45 fps, on what you guys play..."
"My mic is not working.
It works for everithing else but Sqad  >:("
Weird gunplay
"Fps drops from 70 to 40 when just 1 bullet hits me. 5 3600, rx6600, 3200hz 16gb of ram, 1280x960p, fsr2.0 on balance, minimum settings. So, with these settings I dont see shit and still dont have a stable fps."
the game in so glitcy
"game decided not to work any more. i ask steam and the game dev for help and all i get is 'to bad not our problem get scammed off 55$"""
"Too many crashes. Refunded. The game feels good though, I would probably had a lot of fun if ti wasn't for the crashes."
"lags too much,"
"spent three hours joining a server, walking around for 20mins, and then leaving out of frustration, hell let loose would never lmao"
"gets boring fast with or without friends, refunded. In no universe is this worth 50Eur lmao"
game is good dont get me wrong i mean the environment before war is perfect but the shooting is so bad and stupid LOL like wtf is that ?
我身为中国玩家给我的感受非常不好中国阵营的太垃圾了自家国家的军队明明那末强大这游戏坚决太垃圾了
private server rules are gae
"ICO changes aren't for me. Seems to be love or hate for people, so be cautious about it."
"The game is fun for the most part but the biggest problem is it is expanding too fast. The developers need to stop wasting their time on community guidelines for server admins and start figuring out how to fix their game. 

Here is a list of commonly occurring bugs that have persisted since the opening of the game:
- Reload glitch (your weapon can't reload)
- Helicopter skips (the helo skips across the sky and you can't accurately shoot at it)
- Audio glitches that make it seem like someone is shooting next to you
- Getting stuck under the map after climbing over a rock
inability to use bi-pod
- Visual glitches
- Physics get messed up when vehicles collide
- Vehicles get stuck on the smallest of rocks
- Many more that you can find people complaining about.

The biggest problem for me is that the admins on all servers have to follow some pretty stupid rules that the game developers made. For example, I was in a squad called ""join if gay"" and the admins banned the SL and disbanded the squad. This isn't the first time I've been confronted by dumb arbitrary rules that are implemented by the admins. I found out that these aren't the admins' rules, they are OWIs and they force the servers to follow them in order to make them official. 
It is just unfortunate that the developers are a bunch of communist party simps who implement stupid LGBTQ+ alpha beta gamma delta alphabet stupid shit."
This shit is a polished turd with a fan base that takes the game too seriously. Other factors also do not make the game very fun :(
"Consider before buying:
- Performance is awful (even with a 4090 YOU WILL LAG)
- Game stutters, when seeing tanks, trucks, explosions, bullets, standing up, proning, enemies INF
- If you have a vision impairment DO NOT GET THIS GAME
- Cannot turn off screen shakes/effects you will get motion sickness
- Winning still feels like losing
- Hit-reg issues
- If you jump from a pebble you will take fall damage, anything higher you will need a revive
- Crawling for 30 mins just to get shot by someone who was sitting there 1 hour before you
- Not seeing any enemies for 2 hours (you really can go a full game without seeing a single person)
- Digging simulator
- You can't see past 300m without fog covering your scope
- Can't lower volume of voice lines of a 60$ game. ""At this time that is not possible"" - OWI Support
- Can't customize volume types (either eardrum gets blown out by explosions or you can't hear enemy footsteps)
- Enemies can see you through grass but you can't see them
- ""switching to your pistol is always faster than reloading"" not in this game, it always takes longer.

@here Sorry about the ping folks, but we are LEAKING screenshots of upcoming content in return for positive Steam Review links 🙂 38 minutes remaining to get as many in here as possible. Double sized snippets if you turn a negative into a positive!"
No sex
"My main issue with this game is that it's extremely badly optimized. It keeps crashing no matter what I do. I close all of my tasks on my PC except steam, spotify and obviously squad, I lower my textures and overall quality of graphics to low/medium and It still keeps crashing.

Crashes usually occur for me when; 
1. a tank shot, grenade or any type of other high explosive explodes in my line of sight.
2. Heavy machine gun/rifle shootout is going on near me

As of right now for me, the game is unplayable, I didn't have a single session of Squad when I wouldn't crash. I didn't even get the chance to experience the full gameplay after 8.7 hours of ""playing"" because of the crashes. Therefore I can't rate the game's gameplay yet.

For reference; I have GeForce RTX 4060, i7 13650 and DDR5 16 GB RAM."
"The game is realistic in every way,but what bother me the most is thet the fps is constantly bad and the shooting is poorly done,as if my character is holding a rifle with one hand, especially if you have optics on the rifls,i shot with real rifles,non of them behave like that,please fix it breaks the whole game thank you very much bye"
"Honestly I just suck, if you like games like Arma then yeah its fine but I cant seem to ever see the enemy and dont have hours to spend walking around.
-skill issue"
"You're not gonna have a good time as a new player, the game pace is really slow, the tutorials don't teach you enough."
Game don't play like it was sponsored. Poor performance and looks like shiiit.
"2 years ago I would've said this was a good game but now the gunplay is so bad and not fun anymore, people who we're good at controlling recoil and aiming are now nerfed due to ICO dont buy this game"
"After coming back to the game after a while, I've noticed that the gameplay has devolved significantly. This game used to be challenging and the gunplay was skill based, where as now it's too easy to get kills and pray and spray is a viable option. My average kills have significantly increased and it's taken the fun out of the game."
"Too hard, not my thing"
"Not worth it. Gameplay is laggy, servers are few, community is mostly foreign languages, intermittent freezing. You'll be much happier with an alternative like ARMA for milsim.  4 hours of gameplay with 3 hours trying to diagnose issues. For reference, I have zero issues with ARMA, COD, RoN, PUBG, Rust, etc..."
too fucking much time required only play if you are a total incel
boring
"Cant load into the main menu once, after 5 hours"
"run, gun, die"
Gun play is just frustrating
Least fucking realistic milsim out there. Literally buy battlebits. And i am not even ragebaiting
Game was ruined by the new gun play honestly cant enjoy a this game anymore
"broken game, menus freeze more than a deer on a highway and wont let you select teams/squads to join"
"I had squad on a different account and played it years ago. Got it on this new account and honestly, I kinda regret it. The changes to the movement, suppression effect, etc has made this game annoying to play. Trying to revive people and heal them up, only to go blind because some guy is shooting at the wall next to me. God forbid you sprint 5 feet and have to wait for what feels like an eternity to have your sights stabilize. Good luck if you get in one of those matches where there isn't any ammo anywhere because no one wants to run logistics, or drop an ammo bag. If you get a group of friends to play with it can be fun to mess around with. If you are playing solo and join randoms, good luck. Tried to play it again recently for an entire week, but it's just too annoying."
Battlefield V And Battlefield 2042 is Better.
"Matchmaking (if you can even call it that) is abysmal. Frame drops, lag and just overall poor performance. Don't recommend."
no
Dog Shit
ICO bad.
This is the worst game i've ever played. This game is mid. I got yelled at for crashing a helicopter.
"This game should be called Asking Permission and Death Simulator, I have asked permission to refund the game."
This game could be the ARMA competitor as it runs more smoothly on my old pc and seems well designed.. but the flight model even setting up the joystick is so terrible that I have returned the gifted game :-(
"This game has a HUGE new player onboarding problem.  With the new sales and subsequent spikes in player count, match quality is at an all time LOW.  Very little teamwork and communication.  People don't understand basic mechanics because they're not explained anywhere, which forces all the boring activities on to a small amount of players.  Yes, there are boring things in this game that HAVE to be done in order to be successful.  

Gunplay is horrid and janky.  There's hardly any control over your characters basic movements.  Rounds passing in your general vicinity literally blind you, which makes no sense. Weapon sway is absurd.  Honestly, its BORING.

With the ICO, they made an already slow game even slower, and more stagnant.  Games used to rarely reach the end of their timers, now its a regular occurence.  They changed their entire gameplay model to suit people who were getting frustrated because they were getting killed by people they couldnt see.  So in order to create a ""more authentic combat experience"" they made it so now people just spray wildly at each other.  its just dumb, and ungratifying gameplay.

On top of this, OWI refuses to sincerely listen to their community, and has purged most of their past Q&A sessions and related blogs from their website so you can't look back on their empty promises.  I wish I could get the time and money I invested into this game back"
Just play battlebit instead 💀
"one of the worst games ive played in years, didnt see a single enemy for my hour+ of gameplay, id rather put my dick in a blender than play this boring ass shit again. Refunded"
Crashes to much
"of the 6h ""playtime"", i had 2 games about 1h playtime. 0 communication, ppl not going for capture points. This is the worst game i've ever played and have payed for."
Not for me what so ever
"Runs like doo doo, even though I have a fricking RTX 4090"
pathetic playerbase
This game is surch a masterpiece so sad that the devs wont take a look at the steam deck performance this game just keeps crashing mid game or when they switch a map...
Good game but very bad optimization ! I have high end pc and game run like a screenshots
"i want a refund
with who do i play?
no servers no campaigin ...."
comedic weapon handling
"It's like they took the Battlefield formula, and then removed every single fun part, and I don't even like Battlefield!"
.
mods are cool base game isnt
Man fuck this game. Shit that worked in the menu nearly 7 years ago was removed and no longer works. But thank fuck that they added paid skins and emotes right :D
from the moment i bought the game i cant even play it every time i enter a match the game after 3 minutes of play crashes every sing time. i dont have this problem anywhere else with any other game
"I loved this game before ICO.
ICO killed it. Then the updates after ICO made it bearable. Just bearable, not fun.

Your scopes are rolling all over the place, like your character is on a rocky boat. It's perpetually uncomfortable and making me slightly sick.
Furthermore the changes to movement killed any semblance of quick offensives or counter-offensives on foot. Even small things like placing HABs and emplacements, takes way longer now.

It doesn't even feel ""tactical"" or ""realistic"" just feels like the devs decided to nerf some mechanics for the sake of it.

**I will update this review, when the state of the game improves. I would love to say more positive things. But unfortunately all my good memories are overshadowed by a broken game."
Offworld needs to hire a decent graphic designer. Because jesus christ. The UI is the battlefield 2042 level of quality.
They sold out
"love the game, but crashs all the time, wait to buy until they fix it, its not in a good state"
"It's good mil-sim game
but it's too much.

Things I don't like
- being controlled by admin
- you need to be in squad, no freedom
- no call of duty, no battlefield
- So realistic (more than ARMA, one shot-one kill)
- Walking simulator

I will go back to something more casual and more freedom."
Way too difficult for no reason. Have no shame in saying that. It is complicated in many areas for no reason. It's got cool sounds and moments but that is it. If you want a modern shooter mil sim I guess this is it unfortunately. Hopefully team 17 the developer team that made hell let loose makes a modern mil sim cause this is not it. The developers of squad swung and missed.
very       bad
Terribly optimized and movement/gun handling is trash. I've never seen a game that bobs and sways as much as this one.
boring
"This is purely a helicopter review, any other aspect of the game might be awesome. But the main lure for me was gone once I tried the helis.

The helicopters are bad. Really bad. The flight model feels as if they were dangled form a string and pulled on icy rails where ever they are going. There are no sensible physics affecting anything that happens in the air and you'll need to unlearn everything you know about helicopters to get a hang of these weird scifi levitation machines. Switching my heli stick to m&kb made things easier, but that only goes to show the depth of the problem. 

No hate to anyone who enjoys these helis. I'm sure the simple flight model makes it more approachable and predictable, and more enjoyable for many people. But for combined arms action seeking helicopter enjoyers I can not recommend this."
"Movement/gunplay

- Movement feels like you're playing on ice, everything is delayed.
- Gun play feels slow and wonky (character will drag the gun across the screen)

Cool stuff
You're able to drag downed players to cover

something that has annoyed me when you're sitting in a vehicle the player character is aiming the barrel towards the head of your character"
whenever i reinstall this game it takes like a whole day cause theres 20 other seperate downloads that are each like 30gbs big
"Tough for new players, aiming system sucks; bad optimization... 
Not this time."
"It was a good game for years, than the wanna be realistic gunplay comes out. Now it feels more like a waste of time and a camping and a walking simulation. It s nearly impossible for new player to feel joy and even for me it is not enjoyable anymore."
Retarded grenade launcher spammer simulator
"One of the worst FPS games out there. Not user-friendly at ALL. It has the worst UI/UX, with all servers being public. This means that to access a server in your language, you often have to wait in a queue. If you have some nerves, you'll get to the spawn stage, but there's a 50% chance there will be zero vehicles, forcing you to run to the frontline(approx. 5 minutes of running). Most of the time, you'll run and die from who knows where, unable to even face the enemy. It's simply trash, garbage, rubbish."
noodle arms...
"Unfortunately, it has very bad graphics.. and runs bad like hell. Otherwise it would be amazing, with that realistic gunplay, sounds, first-person animations etc., for me it would be even better than PUBG. But right now I can't recommend it because of that."
"A Milsim somehow less  fun than Arma. It feels like most of my time was spent waiting for timers to tick down, recovering from spawn camping and the decisions of incompetent team mates. The graphics are fine though lackluster and seem strangely cartoonish for a Milsim. Equipment choices are minimal and uninteresting. Perhaps it's rose tinted glasses, but unfortunately for me, it seems I will never enjoy a Milsim FPS more than I did Red Orchestra."
I love ico
Its an amazing game but it just crashes a lot that's my only complaint buy at your own risk
i don't remember when i got this game but i sure hope i didn't pay full price after experiencing playing as a soldier who holds guns at their hip like an 80s action movie goon with jelly arms.
"god forbid that i be able to hold my rifle and shoot, this game claims to be a realistic shooter but the thought of a trained infantryman be able to shoot more than 3 feet in front of you, i used to love this game but its just bad now they try promote teamwork by making everyone unable to shoot a weapon without standing still for 4 seconds this game acts like your a little girl shooting a rifle for the first time"
"Dissapointed with the direction of the game, things im looking forward to
1) Back up sights 
2) Gunner camera 
3) Optimisation"
Would not recommend if you're in South Africa. No South African servers and because of that it feels very laggy. So if in ZA don't buy
"Not really fun. 

Let me give you a example of a normal match: Spawn in. Take a vehicle or get a ride somewhere to defend or attack. Shoot at bushes and trees. Die from someone in an unknown location (probably in a bush or behind a tree). Spawn again, run for 5 mins to get back to where you were. Die again from an unseen enemy in a bush. Spawn again. Run for 5 mins.  Rinse. Repeat. aaaand that's it. 

 I'm not saying its a ""bad"" game... just not fun. Like... at all."
"Squad changed, and the community is divided because of the changes that offworld have made to core game mechanics. 

Casual players who play the game are often silent and are unwilling to cooperate, which is a major influence and mechanic  required to having good experience in game play."
every snowflake boomer plays this game
"It's a perfect game while scroling tiktok or youtube. Sometimes fun. If you want a HC shooter-try Insurgency Sandstorm. In this game, the word tactical means: ignore the objective and do something else till the end of the round (i've noticed a true pathern here)."
"This is the first i have ever written a review for a game because if something bothers me i would just simply jump onto a new game. But it is disheartening to see what they have done to the game. ICO just destroyed the game completely, now every bullet cause blurring of the screen not to mention the rest of infantry ""updated system"" now everything is plain headache at this point. I hope that they will either revise what they have done or this game to die out pretty soon."
Servers do not show up
Walking for 15min just so I can get teamkilled while im screaming friendly fire..
"What a colossal letdown Squad turned out to be. With all the hype surrounding it, I was expecting a glorious fusion of Arma 3's intricate tactical gameplay and Battlefield's epic scale. Instead, I got a hot mess that couldn't decide if it wanted to be a serious military simulator or a run-of-the-mill shooter.

Let's start with the asinine blurriness mechanic. Seriously, who thought it was a good idea to turn the screen into a blurry mess every time you get shot? It's not immersive; it's just plain dumb. Congratulations, Squad, you've managed to simulate what it feels like to have cataracts in the middle of a firefight. Bravo.

And don't even get me started on the gameplay. Gone are the complexities of Arma 3, replaced with a dumbed-down version that wouldn't challenge a toddler. And as for the epic battles of Battlefield? Yeah, good luck finding anything remotely resembling that here. Instead, you get small-scale skirmishes that feel more like a game of paintball than a realistic military engagement.

In conclusion, Squad is a sorry excuse for a game that fails miserably to live up to its lofty promises. Save yourself the frustration and steer clear of this dumpster fire of a title."

@here Sorry about the ping folks, but we are LEAKING screenshots of upcoming content in return for positive Steam Review links 🙂 38 minutes remaining to get as many in here as possible. Double sized snippets if you turn a negative into a positive!

Really shitty behaviour IMO, sad as it's such a great game"
"I like this game, but it's unplayable in its current state due to huge FPS drops (despite having a pretty good PC)."
"Bug Severely damaged playing experience. 

First I cannot even rebind the keys, once I did it my character would repeat crouching and stuck at its position. Another very point I cannot stand is I could not change my weapon loadout.When my mouse trying to change it the map would pop out which caused I could only use some very shitty guns. Offworld, Is it so hard to fix these so annoying bug?"
"Shame. This game really had something special here but due to massive performace drawbacks and no intention to fix them or upgrade to the newer UE. While also removing our beloved GE... it isnt worth it anymore. Come for GC, stay for the pepoe.

Seriously though, why you baffled? when the game is built by good devs and then handed to nobodies, expect the worse."
Poo now
"crashes, ass"
"Had Maybe 10 servers under 100 ping for me. (East coast with 1GB, DL speeds) 5 were full, 5 were empty. Could not get into a full server even after queing, and waiting for over 20 minutes. NO THANKS"
"imagine leaking screenshots of upcoming content for positive steam reviews

btw this game is still unoptimized trash"
"Unoptimized to hell, hope if you have a RTX 2060 that you can get a stable 30fps 

Also consistently breaks my only reason to play Squad, Galactic Contention. With the smallest what would be insignificant updates. They just hate modders."
ever sense Offworld added weapon skins the game has been on the decline. When you aim your gun if you aren't standing still its going to start waving around like the trained soldier your playing as has never shot a gun before. This makes sense for some factions like the Irregular Militia Forces but not for the US Marines. That gun shouldn't move a bit this makes the game very annoying in my opinion.
"Failed school, lost my job, wife and dog. By god I'd do it again.

Edit: They came back! Gone again"
"infantry rework lol 
lmfao"
This game is taped together steamy ass pile and honestly the worst game i have ever played. they only made the game to keep military vets from shooting/hanging themselves
"the game is okay i guess if you get lucky, it runs like ass while also looking like ass with everything being grainy as hell past 100 meters. if you dont do exactly what the commander says or you use a vehicle that they dont want you to you just get kicked because you didnt follow their extreme larp fantasy properly."
Sometimes teamnames doesnt show up and it is hard to identify the uniforms it is so frustrating and i hate that

"I'd recommend staying away from this title unless you like being in the boots of a hardened veteran with severe delirium tremens, asthma, palsy, and potentially numerous other health complications that prevent him from running 10 meters and holding a gun level. 

  There's also some pretty glaring balance issues surrounding vehicles and antitank availability. 
  
  A community that ranges from extremely helpful and cooperative, to downright COD tier basement dwellers that think watching Jar Head and Platoon counts as a tour of duty.

  Some of the mods are neat, but it seems like updates to the core game can sometimes completely break them for months until someone figures out  how and what got fumbled by OWI.

  Overall avoid this game, much like OWI avoids implementing a proper flight model for helicopters. 


BTW Mattocracy [UE4] on YouTube got Helicopters working rather well years before OWI realsed their janky messed up interpretation of whirly birds.  It's worth checking out his video on the Defunct Helicopter mod, which is still overall more detailed and accurate to the operation of the real aircraft than anything OWI has the talent to produce."
"Игра не запускается, после титров в самом начале запуска имею черный экран, в диспетчере задач игра не отвечает, но нагружает процессор на 30%.

"plain and simple, its a bad game fuc you"
арма лучше
"Devs are scum.  Rating is padded with positive reviews solicited in exchange for ""leaked screenshots"" of upcoming content.

Optimization is almost as bad as ARMA (you will not get more than 60 fps consistently even on a top-of-the-line rig), and the devs could care less.  Their focus is now exclusively to continue pumping out additional micro-transactions.

Shame.  What was and would could have been."
insanely boring
bad graphics looks like muck bad optimization  gpu and cpu 50% only utilization with i5-12thgen and rtx 3070 barely getting 80 fps  want to buy it wait for sale and don't get it for more than 5$
"This game is more toxic than cod lobbies. Joined a new player friendly server and didnt have a squad to join so I made one. People join, I give someone else squad lead because I have no clue what i'm doing and im kicked for ""Squad baiting"". Not to mention youre constantly told to change a class or sit on an objective MILES away from any fighting. As someone who has a couple hours max to play any game a day I just wanted to flank objectives and maybe snipe. Not join a fucking cult. Jesus christ"

cant run the game thru steam
Community manager broke Steam TOS for positive steam reviews
no ammo. looking at dead enemies gun.. cannot pick it up. wait to die. 6/10
What once was great is turned to garbage with their new combat system from an infantry perspective. You fight the sway of your gun more than you do players.  Not worth 50$ with the current broken shooting system let alone 20$.
Yes
damn unreal crashing
"This game is fucking shit, Heres an example. I joined 3 servers over the last 2 hours and had 0 seconds of combat due to the poor state of the team being totally fucking rolled or totally out picked in the faction select and unable to play the game because no one is pushing except for vehicles that cant be killed because before you hit them with 4 AT devices they run away and then come back and make the game unplayable again while the enemy team dosent push at all they just cock ride the armor. And then theres maps like fucking Talil where infantry had 30 kills in a RAAS and the game was dictated by a few vehicles while everyone else hid because no one fights past 300 meters and no one can push or maneuver. And then on top of that people dont even realize when someone is cheating in the game, Usually in the stronger Fighting vehicles of their faction through ghosting, or literal ESP, in the last 3 days LAV-25s specifically have more information than they could possibly have obtained through legitimate means about HAB locations and infantry movements on the map. aswell as coincidentally just shooting the AT behind cover but only untill hes dead and never when hes not there. This is like absurd and because if its not a guy teleporting and shooting people through the map with magic bullets then its not cheating, thats what the squad players mean when they've only seen X cheaters. REGION LOCK and kick children from the servers you play on, and there will be 0 cheaters."
Cant see where anyone is shooting from.
"game ruined after the Infantry Overhaul Update wich implemented Parkinson Disease, of wich your character cant run 5m and ads keeping the arm steady as if it suddenly gets parkinson disease or drunk af, definetly a milsim where your character is a very trained soldier ofc, thats why most ppl play modded/private servers untouched by the infantry overhaul update, if you plan to invite your friends they would get immediately bored and pissed off and install ARMA 3/Reforger instead saying f***k you hahaha

GG FF 15."
ICO ruined it.
doesn't start
"People are begging for more optimization, but for all the boasts from the devs about listening to their community it seems that falls on deaf ears. ICO update went too far- while ADS weapons wander WAYYYY too much even if you have full stamina, it almost makes me laugh how bad it is. Bipods on weapons are so barrely usable,  they might aswell not exist. Paid emotes are stupid and have no place in this game. Maybe there needs to be a strong competitor to squad before these devs get their **** together."
"God has forsaken me and so has my team

Not *my squad though*, they're great

This game is good for a time sink, but it's on the same level as League of Legends where you don't get actual enjoyment because it's too stressful like having to deal with teammates who do things that will lose you the match that takes on average an hour or the frustrating gunplay that's ""hyperrealistic"" with the recoil and suppression. I mean FFS my trained soldier can't handle recoil?"
"You have fixed aiming now and good job on that, credit where credit is due. Suppression system is still needs a few tweaks though but it's heading in the right direction.

But I still can't recommend, as this game needs serious optimization. And multiple simple mechanics could/ need to be added like using BUS on optics, the ability to walk slower when aiming, or contextual leaning/weapon support on/against walls and barriers."
"Every update I have to go through and fix my audio again and again. Every single other game I play I launch the game and I hear the audio its not rocket science. These devs cant seem to figure it out. I launch the game, hear the game dev logo whoosh by, then nothing. Usually I can run audio through my speakers instead of my headphones to play, but after the last update I cant even do that. If I could hear it would be great game-play, but since I cant the game is obviously unplayable."
gay
game plays like roblox
"It COULD be a popular game, but they make players host ALL servers which only serves to save the developers money and make the player experience infinitely worse than it should be. Literally everyone gets worse performance because they're connected to some dudes PC in his German basement when I live in NY..."
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no on no this game is so fucking hard
"Was gone for military training, and came back to find they had completely destroyed the handling of weapons. People claim it's ""realistic,"" but again as someone who just got done with handling these exact weapons in training, it's really not. In-game if you try and do something that WOULD be realistic, like pieing a corner, you're punished by being forced to aim at the ceiling by IMMENSE weapon sway. 

Stay away unless you like only being able to shoot straight after not moving or touching your mouse for 4 seconds."
"IMAGINE CRAWLING WITH A MACHINE GUN IN A FULL KIT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SOUND, SUCH A GOOD SOUND DESIGN.

Also imagine having a beef with an admin of a single server that puts you into ban list for half of servers of this game, also called community ban list so you can get kicked from a completely different server mid game, lovely concept."
ruined the game with the aiming
Stuck in loading screen constantly and the game is boring
nothing but crashes every time i join a game
game crashes constantly and im running a 4060 doesnt make any sense
"Extremely slow pace and no progression system. There is no point to winning or losing so I hope you just enjoy running across fields and getting server banned for saying ""no no"" words on audio chat. This game has more players banned for speech than they have active players.."
"if you want a positive review, don't bribe me with leaks. just make your game fun."
Great game until they added the ICO update.

""@here Sorry about the ping folks, but we are LEAKING screenshots of upcoming content in return for positive Steam Review links 🙂 38 minutes remaining to get as many in here as possible. Double sized snippets if you turn a negative into a positive!"" - Official OWI Discord, from a Staff Member

For those who are unaware, the above request breaks Steams TOS, and is an unfair attempt at review gouging. 

Squad is a good game, but if OWI is allowing - or even encouraging - their staff to attempt to review gouge in exchange for benefits - in-game or otherwise - then this is a serious sign that Squad and its developers are shifting less from trying to be a community focused game and moving towards trying to turn this into a profit cow like most AAA Studios, and do so at the expense of the player and their experience."
"ICO ruined the game. Great idea on paper, who doesn't like the fluidity of Red Orchestra/Rising Storm or the functionality of ARMA. Execution was terrible, OWI tried to make gunplay ""realistic"" while leaving the damage model arcade-like (health/revive system similar to battlefield). Weapon sway, ADS times. and recoil are insanely exaggerated. There is no weapon resting mechanic. The FOB (respawn point) system means that the drawn-out firefight type of gameplay the ico tries to encourage is meaningless as unless you meatwave a FOB quickly, the people you manage to kill will respawn immediately.

On top of all this, the game gets more bugs every update. The amount of unfixed bugs is insane."
crashes
pvp is dead
walking simulator with un-moderated racism/xenophobic players on most servers
"""Tfw when a Community Manager on discord tries get positive reviews on their game via offering leaked screenshots."""
"Hey everyone! I wanted to clarify the post about leaking images of the M320 yesterday. We were trying to build some excitement for an upcoming Devblog but should have approached it differently. The Intent was to increase engagement through people linking me to their existing Steam reviews rather than by creating new ones.

I want to apologize to the Squad community. We tried this hastily and without forethought. We value honest, open transparency in our communications with the community here, and you should expect the same from us. We want to hear how you feel about Squad—positive or negative—as it helps us be informed in our decision-making and the work we put in to continue to update the game.

We will take extra measures moving forward to ensure we are thoughtfully engaging the community in new and fun ways.

We want to keep making the game the best tactical FPS on the market, and we can only do it with the care and passion of the community behind it. Thanks for helping us be accountable, and please continue to do so. We look forward to growing Squad together."
This game is so poorly optimized. Every single update they make it even worse. The fps goes down each time. They have massive amounts of bugs and fix one but make two more. They also bribe people to leave good reviews ;)
Squad Update V6.0 ruined the game. Gun sway makes me feel like I'm playing a drunkard. My child can steady a gun better than this.

You can tolerate noodle arms.
You can wait 1min before shooting a bullet after ADSing.
You have the patience to walk for 20min and die.
You don't compare to any other game.

Nah
after 1700 hrs i can confirm this game will die the ICO is horrendous i get adding suppression mechanics they are good but the gun play is miserable it is a chore just to get bullets downrange i miss the old squad
"good game ig has alot of potential that is losing out
first of all recoil and gun handling is like you have never trained with firearms (remember you are military you are supposed to already be trained on them), optimization missing,  nice sounds but not a good variety of them"
Dev's trying to bribe for positive reviews is cringe.
ICO is bad.
"Bad aiming system, boring, bad vehicle comment, bribing for positive reviews"
"2025 Update 

Tried to come back and play some more but the server browser is currently broken so I am unable to join any of the servers my clan is in at the moment.

Its honestly impressive OWI continues to break the game nearly a decade down the road.


Back in 2015 when I first donated to the kickstarter I never thought it would be nearly a decade later and I would be writing a negative review telling people to pass on this game.

Huge respect to clans such as Squadops , OG Tactical Trig members and others who have kept the community alive on life support from 2016-2021.

Its been very sad to watch OWI drive the community it spent nearly a decade making straight into the ground. When your community managers start asking for steam reviews in return for leaked pictures of a grenade launcher that is just a new level of sadness to see. 

I will only really reinstall this game when I have the urge to play Star Wars Galactic Contention now.

The core game is quite good but the community management has just been awful. Standing up your own server is a painful experience with only surface level documentation on how to tune the performance of a server to keep it over that 40-50 tick threshold before it starts to see performance impact. While changes to infantry gameplay were needed the Infantry Combat Overhaul alienated a lot of veteran players and clans. Vehicles need a similar overhaul as they are currently painful to play and get stuck on all sorts of little objects. We are also still waiting for mechanics like fast ropes that have been discussed for years now.

Pros 

Amazing community with some fantastic clans that I have played with over the years 
Awesome mods such as Middle East Escalation and Star Wars Galactic Contention 
Diverse weapon selection and vehicles to choose from
Invasion mode is extremely fun when played on the right servers
Good visuals and graphics overall
You will make friends to game with for the rest of your life

Cons 

Very poor optimization and performance
Increase in cheaters since 2022
Poor community management 
Server browser has been in various states of broken for months
Unable to take constructive criticism in their own discord and often mute/ban people quickly
Developer seems focused on other projects even with a recent increase in content.
Tencent investments into OWI
Infantry Combat Overhaul felt extremely rushed and brought back even more bugs than before
Squad leading is a brutal and painful experience at times

Having played over 1000 hours mostly from 2020-2023 its just unfortunate to see Squad in its current state."
Apparently the new community manager broke Steam TOS to coerce reviews by promising screenshots of future content for positive reviews on steam. See other reviews for more details.
played a lot in the past and just started playing again... guess that is done with this bribery b.s. not worth rewarding a shady company
"7 months ago they released an update that made infantry combat (you know, the thing you'll be doing 90% of the time) a complete and utter pain. Squad's gun-play post ICO update is genuinely and without exaggeration THE worst I have EVER seen in a shooter.

In brief, you have virtually 0 control over your aiming the instant a single bullet is fired within 20 meters of you. It sounds like an exaggeration, but the majority of CQB engagements now end as a knife fight because neither player is able to actually hit the other due to the insane weapons sway.

On top of the largest aspect of the game (gunplay) being more frustrating then fun, here is a list of issues that makes me NOT recommend you spend your time or money on this game:

• Squad is absolutely PLAGUED by performance issues (good luck getting the game to run consistently),

• Game ruining bugs that have been present for YEARS (RPG reload bug says hello),

• Incompetent dev team that ignores the player-base.

• Break-down of the game's CRUCIAL teamwork aspect; The fun you have playing Squad WILL be determined by the skill of your Squad Leader. Since the ICO update 7 months ago, most experienced players have quit the game, and have been replaced by new players who don't have the experience to lead the teams and make the game FUN!

If you buy Squad today, just know and accept that the game does get worst with every update."
This game is now ass and the devs should feel bad
Official discord is breaking steam tos to try and get positive reviews. OWI is getting more and more scummy recently.
The Infantry Combat Overhaul a while ago made the Weapon Sway horrible. It's like everyone has Parkinsons. Also the new Community Manager tried to bribe People for positive Reviews. Very scummy.
"The game is decent, the community is decent, OWI is scum. I remembered to leave this review after they broke Steam ToS and bribed their Discord with early access if they posted positive reviews and changed negative reviews to positive. Not a good look for a studio already steeped in controversy."

Game is pretty bad. Begs people in discord for positive steam reviews to leak future content
"Canadian welfare developer turned Chinese data harvester Offworld Industries has hit another new low. Not only did they kill their game with an abysmal Infantry Combat Overhaul, they're now caught with their pants down essentially bribing for positive reviews."
They’re really trying to bribe people for positive reviews because they fucked up the game and dumped experience players. Then they came to Post Scriptum and did the same thing. Fuck these guys. Ruined two of my favorite games.
"DO NOT BUY

OWI employees are incentivicing positive reviews in trade for ""content leaks"" on their Discord server. Add to this the recent addition of micro transactions and the buggy mess of a game.

This is a definitely a game to avoid!"
"Since the Infantries overhaul guns behave unrealistic and its alot harder to fire or return fire because your barrel has gone to space by the time you even know where they are firing from. not to mention random crashes and performance issues.
ull play for like 2 hrs and then something will happen the game does not like and boom CTD fun at times but the devs need to focus more on the community's wants."
"I've stopped playing Vanilla. Sometimes modded if friends are playing it.

I joined a gaming community to play this game as a team and had a ton of fun nights on Discord with them.

One of the game's standout features was its exceptional in-game communication. The standard use of a mic allowed for good banter with players on the battlefield. This was as much a draw as the gameplay itself.

The ICO update meant many experienced players (including myself) stopped playing. There's a noticeable lack of experienced players in game. The infantry shooting mechanics (in an FPS Game) are terrible, and the time taken to raise your weapon to aim down sights is laughable.

ICO has also destroyed the pace of gameplay, encouraging players to camp in bushes rather than risk movement and flanking.

OWI has doubled down on the ICO update, being tone-deaf to long-standing players. Now, they're soliciting positive reviews for 'leaked' updates.

It's scummy, and it's a shame to see how much the developers managed to run the game into the ground and alienate a large portion of their community in less than a year."
They are coercing people for positive reviews on discord.
"After being bought out, the game is turning for the worst. The cherry on top is asking for positive reviews in exchange for screenshots."
"I cannot in good conscious recommend this game as it is right now.

Squad has been suffering from performance problems for several years now. Even with a RTX 4070 and i9-13900k I cannot get a stable framerate at 60 if I push graphic settings above Medium. Maps are extremely unoptimised where looking at a forest will drop your frames by 20.

This has never been addressed or improved on. I used to play this game at 60+ FPS with a GTX 1060 when the game first came out. I updated to a 4070 when the 1060 couldn't handle even 24fps at any point without dropping the resolution down.

Secondly as others are starting to realise. OWI devs on the discord are literally bribing users to post positive reviews and prove it to get sneak peaks to future content. This is borderline breaking Steam TOS and shows lack of confidence in their own product to stand on its own.

Squad is a shadow of it's former self in how it was developed and conducted.

Even to this day, the Marksman class from it's inception is a plagued class where you will get kicked for choosing it. OWI have done nothing to help address this leading it to be a dead class for the majority of matches.

Squad was fun. Empahsis on was."
"Actually I was quite neutral towards Squad but since the latest incident - when a Dev (Ceeg) ""bribed"" people into writing positive reviews - I feel the urge to note some thing.

Unfortunately the game is going down hill for the past two years.
It really seems the devs have lost their focus on what is important.
There haven't been much content or bug fixes/balancing in the past.
Right now it feels like playing abandoned cash cow.

The games optimization is one of my biggest concerns. It's running on a single core with two threads and bottlenecks heavily causing terrible performance even on good machines (running 5800X/4070TI).

A lot of people complain about ICO while I say it was necessary. Unfortunately OWI overtuned the mechanics way too far causing unrealistic/annoying movements (weapon sway, etc.).

Don't get me wrong. It's still unique and very refreshing when you are new and play in a coordinated squad but for veteran players it's really hard to comprehend why they refuse to improve this game.

I really hope that at some point OWI realizes what's going on and return to the original mind set that originally sparked the idea for it."
"700 hours here - game used to be amazing fun. shit now. completely ruined. 90% of everyone I knew also quit after ICO. it hasn't gotten better at all. don't waste your time

also they are desperately asking for positive reviews in their discord, offering leaked content/screenshot in return, pathetic"
"I bought Squad back in 2017 and have been a huge fan of the game ever since, playing both the vanilla and modded versions of the game I have had such fun and have hilarious clips. It pains me a lot to have to leave a negative review but unfortunately even though the community is still great I disagree with the direction that the game is heading, mainly with the infantry combat overhaul (ICO) and now the community manager bribing their official discord community with leaks to gain positive reviews on steam, I have to advise against getting this game at the moment. I think a large portion of the silent playerbase is against the ICO changes and believe that it sacrifices the gameplay for ""realism"". A few of my buddies and I came back to the game after a year or two and the moment they tried to ADS it was an instant turn off for them.

I still love Squad and hope OWI turns things around and finds better ways to improve the game."
devs have sunk to a new low. After ruining the game for their core audience and skewing to a different community for content. Negative reviews bombed their game from the majority of the monthly active users at the time. OWI is now coercing members of their discord with skin keys and teasers of future content all for the low price of violating steams TOS. All you have to do to get a teaser for future content or to win a skin key is to send a positive review on the steam store page! something extremely in violation of steams terms of service! Dont forget to dm them with proof that you indeed shilled out your precious voice for stolen content! disgusting
"They did it again:
- OWI has added ingame ad that shows up when launching game - meaning that they advertise the game in the game itself - I already bought the game I don't need to be sold on buying it. That video is almost 3 minutes long btw
- OWI has (once again) made changes to the game without announcing them in release notes - multiple vehicle sounds were changed, audio falloff range was increased,
- OWI has added mobile spawn vehicles to a single faction in the game which completely messes with the overall meta of the game,
- new scoreboards are a mess, unless server owners adjust the defaults you have no time to even vote for the next faction or map because you're still checking the scoreboard,
- game performance is constantly neglected by the devs, they released a faction with minigun vehicles that cause server wide FPS drops when fired,
- meanwhile bugs that have been present in the game for years are still unresolved, i.e. command actions being called in on a completely different location, Nvidia Reflex being broken since multiple patches, etc."
"The ""community manager"" ceeg pinged everyone on discord to leave a positive review and he will ""leak"" screenshots of a future update, so here it is."
"Meh, After a couple of years still feels like a Uniengine assetflip. Squadleading is hell and there still a shit ton of bugs. All this for 45€..... 

Not saying it's that bad... It's just average. The ico is a very little step towards a good direction but still very little cooperation.

Also, community manager asking for positive reviews in exchange of sneak peaks? Fuck off man."
ICO update ruined the game
"Tried it...seems to be getting worse and worse. 
i played before offworld took over. things seemed better then. recoil was better.

now its like your soldier has noodle arms. and is an asthmatic kid...

"99% of the playerbase just camps, not sure if they are just mentally slow and/or new to FPS games"
"This game has an amazing and dedicated player base, to which OWI and its creators have been slowly eroding away the skilled and knowledgeable players. After owning this game for 8 years and countless hours I still continue to play only if even just for the people and not its awful horrible gun play introduced in the ICO.I get trying to introduce more ""realism"" when in reality its a game that has so many bugs that it breaks completely out of reality. The game for me was fun because it was a game that had the perfect blend of battlefield and ARMA but the devs seem to think that his game is a mil-sim when its laughably short of anything close. I would tell people to play something else but unfortunately there really isn't much like it. I keep playing because I am dumb and hopeful even though I am doubtful they will ever revert the changes they made to the infantry combat... 

I would rate the idea the base game as a 10/10 but the execution is horrendous and I hope the devs mothers are disappointed in them for destroying a great game."
no
"WAS FUN, THEN THE UPDATE HAPPENED."
"this game was great until it started running in 4k and when i change to a lower res it hides the button to accept. please refund me. never playing again.

edit: i tried the game again, wtf is this ads???? please refund."
"Overpriced Trash that is horribly optimized if you run anything less then a 40 series like me it'll have huge lag spikes for no reason , ICO Ruins The Skill input of the game and the only people who say otherwise are BOOMERS who can't aim at a reasonable speed."
Its insane this game has so many positive reviews. This has to be the worst gun play in any shooter I have ever played. Military realism/sim is a joke. ADSing feels like I'm trying to hold up a telephone pole and the person Im controlling has never held or seen a firearm until the second the match starts.
ruined the game with that update. uninstalled.
Too many cry baby losers who complain and ban over trash talk in a military sim or if you say something the admin doesn't like you get banned. All i see in this game is a cesspool of degenerate losers who got bullied so much IRL so they make a server to be a total cuck tyrant.
"Reviewing after ~900 hours and AFTER overhaul of infantry mechanics.  Updated infantry mechanics turn infantry play into a running and camping simulator. Recoil and gun mechanics make followup shots ineffective. Suppression mechanics (overly) reward players to spray in a general direction. The update to infantry mechanics has introduced a much lower skill cap to the game. Someone with 1000 hours and someone with 100 hours are now far more likely to have the same net impact on a game when playing infantry. This may have been the intent of the devs to make the game more accessible. But instead of boosting the effectiveness of inexperienced players and/or tapering the learning curve, they have neutered the effectiveness of experienced players. 

Squad still has incredible vehicle play. Armor vehicle mechanics are still incredibly fun. But good luck waiting for 30 min vehicle respawns."
"since recent updates it has been non stop crashing, cant even play for an hour(after wasting time sitting in a queue) without it crashing randomly in match, ridiculous, will update when this gets fixed"
The worst parts of ARMA and Battlefield rolled into a stale package.
One of the worst communities of players I have ever been unfortunate enough to play with. Don't buy it.
"After 1200 hours and years of enjoyment, squad is now pretty dead to me.

The developer's attempt to create a truly 'realistic' mil-sim has sucked all of the fun out of the game. The bullet suppression, the recoil, and the time it takes to pull up and steady your gun now just rewards players to spraying bullets around their opponents to keep accurate shots from coming back (instead of actually aiming their rifles).

The result is a maelstrom of bullets, blurred vision, and a black scope face (from not being centered due to suppression), and a distinct lack of fun.

The prior versions of the game had an appropriate amount of suppression/recoil/etc to keep the game feeling realistic, but not unplayable and certainly very fun.

I will check back in a year to see if this gets any better."
"Been playing this game since before launch and let me tell you this game used to be SOOO good, but ICO ruined all their progress, added a whole bunch of stuff expecting to make the game better only to make it just feel clunky and just generally worse not to mention it used to have flawless graphics now its a blurry mess, hip fire is practically pointless now cause your character moves the gun left and right at the slightest shift of your mouse, Please just revert back to alpha settings or let us choose which update we can play on and this game would be heaps better. UPDATE: Just play the modded servers if you want the good ole' squad experience."
trash game need a nasa computer to run it for some unlucky fellas
No clue what the hell was going on for any of it. Was yelled at by people for not knowing what to do. Game-play felt slow and clunky. Not fun at all for a new player.
"Its sad to see this game die out, used to be many servers, now theres only 5 left"
"The game requests too much teamplay , if you are playing with low IQ players you wont be spawning in the map. Most of the players locks out the mechanized vehicles and do not co-operate with the team. If you want to suffer and experience worst gunplay you should try this. But i will give this game with the new update 2 out of 10 it was 7 out of 10 before the update.

After discovering Global Escalation Mod on workshop :

- If you are going to play this game definetly consider downloading the mod and play on the modded servers."
"OWI ruined this once-great game with their radical ICO update, fundamentally transforming a near-decade-old title into an awkward abomination. Gunplay is now absolutely horrendous. It's a Parkinson's disease simulator with optimization issues."
Infantry overhaul ruined the game
I lost my friend to this. He officially joined the taliban.
"Game was great before the ""infantry overhaul"". The developers decided your soldier was no longer a trained individual and held his gun like a monkey in a wind tunnel. The sway is unbearable and the fps goes down with each ""update"". Also bug that have been in the game forever such as the running man and loading a tow while seated in a vehicle have taken a backseat to all other ventures from OWI. If you don't have a mic buy one. I can't understand why they didn't make that a recommendation when buying the game. But it looks like OWI will continue to cater to the people who want to take vics from the spawn by themselves and drive to the nearest enemy squad instead of the vets that have propped the game up since project reality."
HELICOPTERS ARE SO FUCKING STUPID
"Its good, but performance is terrible, don't recommend"
"I joined, was a squad bot, and killed a griefer causing mass cass. and I got kicked for griefing. Thanks SOF, great server. My SL decided ""**** you too.""

Amazing Squad experience after not playing for a year, time to add one more."
"Not worth it, project reality is free and better"
unless your part of private group of people do not expect anyone to help or talk as far as that goes. slowest walking sim ive ever seen in 31 years sad to say it does not hold up to its name might as well play arma 3 or something else insurgency has more team work than any server on here i have 20 hrs in and lost any motivation to play anymore
"This game was very good, till they reworked the combat system and now its not as good and most of the game is spent walking back to position, added Micro transactions, and now a giant sphere in the sky? this is supposed to be a semi realistic milsim but now we have magic floating spheres that revive you when you're downed? what happened to the realism?

game that was genuinely enjoyable now a gutted mess :("
can't see teammates well also can't tell what to do in the game I was running for like 10 mins just to die and have no idea what happened
"Parkinson simulator
which probably fits the player base that are all 40 yr old wanna be operators. 
your trained solider runs out of energy in 7 steps 
you just simply cant aim 
the cope of the community is it realistic"
wdfawfawf
"combat update needs to be changed, its so unfun to play the game cause of it"
"Hide in bushes, be invisible, shoot a player, get lit up by 10 other enemies because somehow they have perfect hearing and vision?"
all the server admins have the strictest rules on server chat and also have a website that doxxes people who get banned on their server so they can ban you from every other server. It really is quite something. I can't believe SQUAD allows this. Cuckold behavior.
"Update: as of the lastest patch my game has started working properly agian which is wonderful, but i still fear it going bad agian with the next update so i changed my recommendation to a yes, but still keep the rest of my review in mind

Now im going to start off by saying that I absolutly LOVE this game. First off, the comunity is amazing, friendly, and most importantly always willing to help you. I have yet to find any toxicity within the player base. Even when games are going very bad, the team still friendly and just trying to have fun.

Secondly, the gameplay is something very unique that one cannot find almost anywhere else except from Arma and even better, it actually handles well and doesnt require a beast of a computer to run. This is the game for those out there who have played battlefield or other similar games but was dissapointed by the lack of tactical gameplay or realism. The maps in this are HUGE (well by most shoopters standards anyway. {Cough, cough, Arma, cough, cough}). Every player has to work with their squad (hence the name) or else they cant get anything done, and each person in a squad fills a specific and vital role.

Now my personal favorite part of the game is after the game has gone on for a bit and the defences have been built. (you can look it up there are some damn impressive fobs out there that have been made) These things feel like fortresses inside until it comes under attack then things get crazy. Explosions left and right, comms going nuts, medics running wild. Its awesome.

Now based off all of that one would think that this games deserves the biggest like anyone could ever give it. And once my next point gets fixed it will.

I CANT DAMN PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!

Sorry for the caps but Im really pissed about this. Whenever i launch the game, even though the settings clearly says its in 1920 - 1080, it seems to come up with a new random screen resolution and go with that.
""Well ok thats annoying, how about i just reset the settings. Hopefully that fixes it."" I say to myself. NOPE!!!! that just leaves it halfway off the screen. So I exit and look up a fix online. What I find is go into the files and change it. besides the fact that that alone is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it still doesnt work. As of right now the mouse if far too offset from the screen to even play AND the screen resolution is off.

Now I understand this is still in Alpha and glitches and problems should be expected, but I paid $40 for it so expect a review. Also I would be less pissed if the devs actually did anything to fix this problem instead of just adding new content to the game without any concern as to wether or not the game ACTUALLY IS PLAYABLE.

Sincerely the game is great and if it worked, it would probably be my favorite game on steam, but as of right now I cant even try to play it.

For those of you who didnt bother to actually read all of that.

Pros
- Awesome community
- Great maps
- Tactical gameplay
- Teamwork
- great classes and good gunplay
- BTRs
- New content all the time

Cons
-DOESNT ♥♥♥♥♥♥ WORK!!!!!!!
- Cant fix screen resolution or mouse offset problems
- Devs dont seem to try and fix before mentioned problems

Now please, dont think this is a bad game. Keep your eye on this game and see if these problems ever get fixed. Now hopefully the devs will see this and fix the problems with the next update so I can get back to the wondeful experience I once had.

"Ever since the Infantry Combat Overhaul, you can't align your sights worth of sh*t, you run out of stamina in 10 steps, and they add game breaking patches that don't make sense at all. If you have been interested in this game, don't get it. Invest in Arma or some other Milsim fps."
literally cannot play without crashing and steam won't refund so that's cool
"Always crashing, even after doing all the tricks in the book,as soon as you join, it crashes, then it works, you aim, boom crash again,needs to be fixed ASAP !!"
Bring back old Squad this shits Dog Water choppy as hell
"was a good game but the sway and stamina is all wrong, and the inability to aim straight 

modded servers are fun"
"I really want to like this game, mechanics and gun play are superb, there's a huge learning curve and i cant seem to find a server that is newbie friendly or understand WTF I am suppsoed to do when in game. get killed loads without seeing where from then lie down for 15mins waiting to be revived. I do keep coming back hoping something clicks with me"
game is full of homos
"This game is buns. Every 5 fucking seconds I get yelled at by a middle aged man that doesnt know where he belongs in society. You then proceed to have the drunk divorced dads that probably lost the kids, keep killing you because they don't know if your on their team or not."
"From being one of my favorite games to being added to the pile of once great games that are now ruined by the developers.
After ICO update the game is just unplayable and most importantly not fun anymore. Performance is terrible, constant obnoxious blurry vision, unrealistic sway, weird looking recoil that just makes no sense and so much more. Please just roll it back or add a seperate version of the game that doesn't have this stupid ICO update that no one asked for."
Parody of a tactical game.
"This game is a lag fest. Old smoothness is gone. 4070 , 5600x and runs like a-crack."
"walk for ten hours to your death while listening to a british person yell at you

3/10"
it was good until the update on ADS until they at least tone it down DONT BUY also servers becoming more liberal than the West when i play as the chinese faction its okay for people to say things like ching chong bong bong but as soon as i call someone a P**** thats to much also you cant swear at all on servers anymore youll get kicked immediately
"Went downhill after ICO update. Tried getting back into it, just didn't hit the same. Was a great game, but now feels like I've just wasted 4k hours on this POS. This game was a great option if you were looking for something in-between ARMA and BF/COD, but now it's trying too hard to be something that it's not. Such a shame."
"cant shoot, people dont understand the word squad itself and the mechanism is just to make it look like another milsim game but nothing close to it. nowonder 44 is also rekt"
"50 fps gaming with shitty shooting mechanic, suppresion mechanic sucks"
they should name this game Crash not squad it crashes every time i play it. seriously though wtf this is very annoying to say the least. none of my other steam games crash like this its hot trash do not buy.
"I have got to be honest, when this game works I love it. But for the love of God, I crash once every to every other game. I'm running a viciously stacked machine on new tech and this game can't run for more than about 30 minutes in a server before it bites the bullet. I constantly check my software and hardware and its  every single time I play type of problem. I don't get it and I'm about f***ing over it.

Just to be clear, this doesn't happen on any other game."
"Not worth the price at all. Server browser is broken, most of the english speaking servers for EU speak primarily other language and you can't filter them out."
ICO update is trash
Unplayable game the game was fun but now it sucks no one knows how to play and almost all servers have admins that don't do anything no one plays logistics and every one plays like its call of duty absolutely unplayable today
A game that features armor that plays a large role in a teams victory but cannot properly design the game to have tracked vehicles be able to go over tiny rocks. This game is not worth $50
can't do shit
"Each update somehow makes the game worse. The ICO ruined playing inf for me but i soldiered on thinking it would get better. The new maps were bad for armour and i soldiered on. The new layers system has stopped any form of armour balance occurring and im struggling to want to continue. The games core is pretty good, but the level of incompetence shown in each and every update sucks the soul outta me. Im still gonna play it, im too deep in the hole.

At least the star wars mod has given it a bit more life for me."
Crashes 10 min into any match
"Like playing a fatty with asthma. You will spend your life running, getting your breath back and have an aim of a spastic. Recoil will send your teeth down your throat. Dogshit

Previous review:
""Uninstalled. Updates = Dogshit"""
"Game has a steep learning curve, it has a lot of rules and easy to get kicked from a game or your own squad. Its buggy as hell, There are some games i cant even play because lag is getting me killed. i see lots of people disconnecting each game and its not just them quitting. There is an obvious problem with hackers, but every FPS game has this issue. This game has fairly long queue times, but not as bad as Beyond The Wire. It is without a doubt the most realistic game i have ever played, but when you spend 30 minutes running in a direction then die it is sort of a waste of time. The vehicles are hard AF to drive so its like your vehicle is always drifting instead of going straight."
drop fps in nivdia  1070 8g ti  wtfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
guoffy aim system
I no no wanna

"9/10 times your whole time is completely retarded but when people actually lock in its fun, however this never happens anymore so"
I have a 4080 super and the graphics maxed out yet the game looks like 2013 rust also GET RID OF MOTION BLUR FROM BULLETS
it would be fun if it did not crash everytime i play the game
"The good: 
- Excellent community.
- Good balance between realism and enjoy-ability.
- Good vehicle game play.
- No grind or pay to win!
- Very little hacking.

The Bad: 
- Team balance is sometimes an issue, especially on servers run by clans. 
- Some maps and game modes are not much fun.

The Ugly: 
- Recent updates totally ruined infantry game play. Shooting is nearly impossible. Never in my life IRL have I had so much trouble aligning sights. This is the sole reason I quit playing this game in recent months, and the only reason I don't recommend it at this time."
"In some ways it's great. It does manage to capture the great gameplay and sense of combat from project reality.

However, the gunplay and movement mechanics are so awful that almost every fight is testing your patience for frustration. You can literally take your hands off the mouse and have a drink while your character tries to aim at the enemy.
Any fights within 10m are completely pointless.

Additionally, the technical side is not good. The graphics feel very unpolished and ""unity game"" like, while at the same time having high PC spec requirements, low fps and input lag. There are other games that run 3x faster and look 3 x better.
For example Project Reality.

Project Reality was a hacked together mod for the BF2 engine. So many of the functions and gamerules in that game were based on server scripting, using chat commands and understanding the non-obvious rulesets because they could not change the UI etc.

This should not be the case when making a game from scratch, yet the dev team just ported over many of the gameplay mechanics, instead of making the new UI/gameplay more userfriendly."
sux but i love it
Might be a good game.  I could not get past the horrible graphics.
Horrible performance with oudated graphics (except explosions)
MEH
epic broke my game
"If you like waiting for a spot in a server for 30 minutes, this is the game for you."
boring
"The fact you can get community banned from every server just because of one bad admin is ridiculous. For those who don't understand what i'm referring to, i'm referring to the squad community ban list. Most NA servers use this community tool which enables a reputation tracker on your account that carries across all servers. I got a permanent ban on Potato Fields for destroying friendly assets and my ""Risk Rating"" went from 0/10 to 10/10 on my account and i'm no longer able to play on any of the consistently populated and decent ping servers. Also, most of the NA servers are modded by libshit rtards that flip their lid over the most minorly offensive things."
"graphics are dated and it plays extremely weird. i saw their updates and it's so much worse.
honestly, with this investor behind it that also ruined my formerly favourite shooter franchise, it's no surprise i can't say anything positive about this game."
game is shit now
"Gunplay in this game went from perfect to unplayable. CQC fights are a joke, and they still haven't tweaked this game after ICO patch."
good simulator of an obese 50 year old man that needs to shake his hands so hard that he barely holds the rifle
"If you want a combined arms, tactical game that require teamwork that you can jump straight into, then buying Squad will probably be worth it to you. I can't however recommend a game that is so similar to Battlefield 2, a game almost 2 decades old. Squad still is very similar to Battlefield 2 in that it is still very much a free-for-all-sandbox type game. For example, let's say you want a run a vehicle Squad, filling some tactical niche. The moment you lose the vehicle, you are no longer able to do that, due to respawn timers which can be over 10 minutes. Further, a crippled vehicle will block the spawn of a new one. Now suddenly you have become a different type of Squad, and whatever plan or tactical approach you had goes out of the window. Neither is there a robust system for claiming vehicles or ensuring the people operating these vehicles actually cooperate with the team. This is indicative of an overall design that prevent players from applying any kind of consistent tactical approach, or deliberate teamwork. As a result the experience of meaningful teamwork and tactics are rare, unless one joins a more rigid competitive scene.

One of the greatest memes in the game is how Squad leaders carry the success and intent of the game. Especially infantry squad leaders who has to cajole 8 complete stranger into doing something. The free-for-all nature of the game does not alleviate Squad leader insanity which is sure to follow. As a result, you will have 3-4 main infantry Squads, and if they are even remotely close to one of two relevant objectives you are are having a relatively great match. The points about vehicle Squads apply here, even more so. The sad fact about Squad is that teamwork is optional."
Game used to be good but since they changed the combat style and aim style its unplayable for me you cant aim/run without your gun swaying all over the place and the recoil is just so unrealistic and takes me out of the game. In a game where running is such a big part your guy gets tired after 10 seconds of sprinting. Also they have a suppression feature that turns your screen completely blurry for way too long that will just completely take you out of the fight not sure how people still enjoy this game and put up with the pointless updates at its current state but hey maybe its for you just giving my opinion and heads up
game crashes too much and i mean way too much my drivers are updated and my pc is on the higher end and it always seems to crash when either loading in and mid game at first i thought it was an issue only i was dealing with but i slowly figured out that this issue hasnt only happened with me but wit a large group of players. i mean if they could figure it out id play but i literally cant play lmaooo
can not refresh server anymore. Got totally blocked. And this game is more like a walking or driving simulator as it is not that fun(hard core).
Play this game if your a pu$$y and kick people for being new @Playground Server
This game isn't fun
Trying to play after the ICO update is like visiting a best friends grave. I'll revisit it once a year and leave in tears.
"Waaaaay too much. I mean, at least let people choose their loadout to an extent instead of forcing use of those awful optics. In the training I get no optic which is OK but those awful optics being forced. No thanks. HLL is 100x the game this mil sim wannabe will ever be. It's a shame too, I was VERY excited to try it since it reminded me of the slow paced realistic Americas Army 20 years ago... Nope. Big flop. HLL is the best game of this variety out and will continue to stay that way. Squad is HLL with slight variations that make it much worse to play. Otherwise it's overall the same game, with slightly different graphics."
hope you enjoy sand maps with nothing on them cause that's all these people play. its like insurgency but somehow bigger with less stuff. only play on a free weekend.
trash game full of Crash and the Garbage Unreal Launcher and getting kill from no were
"I have a very good pc and internet but the game keeps crashing to desktop or crashing on loading map?  And i paid for this game, WOW!"
"shit game, you need to play on low with 4k resolution just to see enemies. no max render distance. running sim, buy another game."
"Voting system fucked things even worse than the combat update. Good idea on paper, shit in the field"
"just watch other people play this, its not worth the headache or disc space.
""with some more hours into the game i can now say that, if you want to bullied by any narcissistic asshole who is a squad leader into doing their every whim and will or else youll be kicked from the squad meaning you will only be able to use the recruit kit then this might be the game for you. fuck man i just want to play a fucking game!-"
"Not working great on the deck
When finishing a game the next server is causing the deck to stuck/crush and it's ruining the experience"
the game devs are on weed they like to take money but they dont fix the server browser or the sound output bug
Very Shit game
"Loved the first 230 hours, but the ICO is complete garbage. Gunplay is ruined, every server is nothing but armor squads because no one wants to hold a rifle."
arma without the realism
"i can't find any server + the optimize is so bad , but it's nice game"
дерьмо ебаное
Can the someone just give us an option to revert to before ICO with servers too?
"REVISED: Original Below
I am publicly revising my review after an extra 120+ ICO hours. They have walked back several of the most egregious elements of the ICO combat, however, the overall shift in infantry combat has done nothing to ""slow down"" game play nor make it more methodical. It encourages a poor style of ""camping"" (due to still incredibly bad stamina), excessive vehicle dominance, and a lack of veteran players leading and playing. None of these were issues pre-ICO and they objectively make the game worse while frustrating people who knew Squad for it's premium shooting mechanics. 

Where to go from here? The develops are clearly not going to completely rollback ICO, the damage has been done and the community has lost significant amounts of experienced players due to how aggressively the overhaul was deployed. That is okay, numbers are at a consistent high, I hope they are able to gradually reduce the worst of the ICO (absurd suppression and noodle arms) while keeping its core implemented. As it currently stands, I still cannot recommend this game for a new player seeking a tactic SHOOTER, that prioritizes combat over a false sense of milsim. 
______________________________________________________________________
1200 hours since the very start of Squad, read the other recent reviews from high-hour players. I've watched many experienced friends turn away from the game and provide negative reviews.

The recent infantry overhaul is brutal and absolutely kills the game for players who had played it previously. Maybe it's fine for new players who were not familiar with the mechanics. Squad used to have the best mix of infantry combat and tactical game play, now the combat is one of the absolute worst on the market. Your character is incredibly slow, clunky, and low-stamina and weapons have increased sway and are inaccurate. This was all to slow game play but effectively makes the game more frustrating than Arma without the fun gun play.

I don't understand who these changes are implemented for but it driving your veteran players away from the game. I do not recommend buying this game unless you are keen on waiting for 30 minute vehicle spawns as that's the only way its playable now."
They completely ruined this game. Performance wise and gameplay wise. Infantry combat overhaul is the worst update in the history of the game. Your soldier is a fat stay at home dad that couldn't complete basic training and is carrying military equipment and a machine gun he can't aim to save his life. And can only run 10 feet before he's out of breath. This game is 70%-90% running btw. Let that sink in how miserable that is.
New infantry update ruined squad... Fix your gun play please
Cant join a server without a thousand random rules
"Games dogshit, OWI can't stop themselves from changing shit that worked perfectly fine. As of right now I can't 2 tap someone to the neck under 10 m with 7.62x54r lmfao."
Don't like it
"The first thing I have to say is the reality of the shooting, I really like the sound, it's incredible and contributes to the atmosphere of the war, a big minus in the game is not recognizing the uniforms, they are all the same, so someone from your team will always kill you, get used to it, the graphics are not bad, but they are very poor, which spoils the game is a lot when you enter the buildings, there is nothing, I don't think it's worth this money, if you like it, go for it"
"One of the worst optimization in a game I've ever seen, i3 10th 16GB RTX 3060 only get up to 40fps."
Vehicles are the only playable thing in this game. ICO update killed the fun in infantry.
Long wait times to join a server due to queuing system.
م
"Game looks nice, 90% of player base is just random high ping screamers lol 
5/10 for quality, game play is ass"
Disappointing game.. This game is more like a walking simulator than a battlefield like
"ICO killed the game. This is my fourth(?) account because I sometimes get toxic and get banned from servers that I like, so I've supported the game for years and recommended it to all of my friends that are into milsim and milsim adjacent games, but it's not worth it anymore. I've played since 2017, I've given ~5000 hours of my life to this game, but I don't think I'll ever play it again other than cursory glances to see if it's been fixed.

The main issue currently is not what I expected from the ICO, during the playtests and when it was first introduced I thought it was completely ok, and mechanically it's fine. It slowed down infantry combat a little bit but not significantly, what actually changed was the community - the complete destruction of team cohesion and competency. Maybe there's some server where it's better or some community that can still play well enough, and this was somewhat of an issue before, but I haven't had a game in the last 40 hours of gameplay where my SL both had a mic and understood that you could in fact look at a map and make decisions about where you should be, and when I SL, I can do ok but everything feels almost random. All your friendly squads will be scattered across the map with no rhyme or reason, the armor will either ram into enemy fobs and die or completely annihilate the enemy, you'll take points with literally no resistance up until you get to the one point where they have a fob and then you're facing the entire enemy team, and no one will respond on the command channel. 

I don't know why the ICO destroyed the community, the base level mechanical changes don't seem to imply that it would have, but it did. I don't think rolling it back would fix it, maybe it has to do with server browser issues, maybe it's been introduced to more new players who enjoy the game in a way that I don't. If you get the game and end up loving it that's fine by me, but as it stands now it's a husk of what it was before.

TL;DR - ICO killed gaem, mechanics OK, community dead."
Gameplay is terrible. rooms are full of people who quit instantly no controller headphone compatibility. total waste of money
"This game was good when the shooting felt reactive to a players actual ability. Now it's less of a shooter than most fps games on Roblox. Feels more like a roleplaying game now. Fun game got flushed down the drain, oh well plenty of other shooters to enjoy."
game keeps crashing the minute i load into a game
Absolutely do not buy this game under any circumstances. Mobile game CEO making the best decisions of his life out here.
"They took one of, if not the, best immersive 2000s era shooter and actively updated it into being a game I won't even boot up anymore after 400 hours... 

ICO took everything that made this a great shooter and turned it into a walking simulator with loud noises. The game is no longer about getting into intense and fun gun fights. It's really a shame. I gave the ICO a fair shot and kept loading up the game for a while, telling myself I just needed to get used to the changes. It's not going to happen, they ruined the fun.

edit: I saw some other commentors suggesting allowing individual servers to determine if the gameplay is pre or post ICO. This would bring back your veteran players who want intense team and skill based firefights while allowing new unskilled players to enjoy their team deathmatch walking simulator."
"DEVS HAVE CHANGED THE GAME SO MUCH THAT ITS NOT EVEN THE SAME GAME IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO, EVERYTHING WE'VE WANTED THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING ELSE THAT DOESN'T MATTER. GAMEPLAY IS LIKE HAVING A DRUNK 8 YEAR OLD KID HOLDING A RIFLE."
old squad best squad
.
Worst milsim of them all move round like a segway going 2mph. Gun moves about the screen like a fidget spinner. Gunplay is awful everytime I come back to the game to give it another go i'm reminded instantly whats so wrong with the game and there's alot. Do yourself a favour and go play Arma 3 or Hell Let Loose this game blows and you can have 10000x more fun on either one of them games compared to this cesspit of degenerate keyboard generals.
Not fun
infantry update is not good. gunplay is terrible. for turtle players and mech/armor players.
"Update to ""improve"" infantry movement and combat was a huge miss. Makes the game nearly impossible to play in most circumstances when anyone is shooting even remotely in your direction. Go back to the old game play and hope maybe some people will rejoin the game otherwise this is another example of game developers messing with something they shouldnt have and killing a once very good game. Also, take out that dumb map and team voting."
"games unplayable. cant finish more than 30 minutes continual w/o game crashing. my pc specs are more than enough. 3080ti with 32 g ram. done everything under the sun to fix the crashing issue. game uninstalled, 0/10 do not recommend."
"4090, 24 gb gddr6. and 64 gb of ddr5 and a i9-13900k at medium settings 60 fps max my friends temu pc runs squad better"
"This used to be a good game

I used to really like squad, having over 1000 hours but over the last year it has gotten pretty bad. Although I liked some of the Combat Overhaul play-test the actual implementation now is terrible and gets frustrating very quickly, combine this with a lack of good SL's just leads to complete sh!t shows for most games. 

This is not helped by what looks like developer incompetence regarding the server hosting, which would just show random servers stopping you from joining your friends.

Overall the game currently March 2024 is in a pretty poor state and was significantly better 2 or so years ago but has gone majorly down hill over the last year or so.

I realise people will say the player base has increased which means the game is good but I would say most of these players are on the Chinese servers, which there is a lot of now."
Gunplay feels horrible compared to how it used to be.
"The game was good despite some bugs and some efficiency issues regarding the rendering of the weapon sights that have been corrected with future updates (at least for me), but with the v6 update with the combat overhaul the game does not feel the same, it is an update to gun play that no one has asked for and I hope they revert it (but I doubt it), it is a game that before that patch I would recommend but currently and unfortunately NO"
"Rather be trapped in a swimming pool full of piranhas than play this, and I'm serious."
Reverse the ICO or watch your game die.
"cant even find servers on the game, HOW CAN I NOT FIND, HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO ME. Therefore bad game, ALSO THIS GAME HAS SO BAD UNREALISTIC OPTICS FOR THE GUNS, SOOO BAD LIKE MAKES NO SENSE WHY YOU CANT HAVE A NORMAL OPTIC, CANT sometime you lucky and find good optic but is rare 99% of them are terrible soo bad you it ruins the game. LET ME JUST HAVE A NORMAL RED DOT SIGHT OR SUM. not cool"
GAME IS RAN BY LIBERALS WHO BAN FREE SPEECH THE ADMINS ON MAN SEVERS ARE FAGGOTS AND NOBODY LIKE A FAGGOT
Honestly... its hot GARBAGE. Janky af. Sloppy. Take notes from Hell Let Loose and get good. I'll wait for Squad2 made by a different studio
Only good with mods and friends
"I use to recommend this game to my friends because how how fun and organized the gameplay was. However, ever since the ICO update, the enjoyment was gone. Devs really wanted the game to be more realistic only to fail and making it unrealistic. ADS is so bad and the weapon sway feels like your character is drunk. Whether you're prone, crouched or standing, it's unbearable and have to wait until all your stamina is back up to actually land A shot. 
Went from playing everyday to only play modded servers like Galactic Contention once every other month, or just not play at all."
"I love realistic shooters, I've played hundreds of them, but I've never seen a game with an Aim Down Sights (ADS) system as bad as the one this game has, it doesn't matter if you're lying down, and with a bipod, as soon as you aim the sights move as if you were in an earthquake for several seconds, it is literally unplayable, gun fights depend on who was lucky to hit the first shot.

And no, before you say it, I'm not saying that ADS has to be like Call Of Duty where you quickscope the entire lobby, but the one this game has is totally excessive, it completely ruins your experience, the sad thing is It wasn't like that before, it was because of an update they did where they changed everything. 

Compare it to all other squad competitors and NONE have an ADS system as bad as this game has, freaking disgusting."
"Squad: A Once-Promising Strategy Shooter Now Lost to Commercial Greed

Once hailed as a beacon of tactical excellence, Squad has plummeted from grace into the depths of commercialized mediocrity. The game's descent began with the ominous shift in its development studio from American to Chinese hands, marking the beginning of its tragic transformation into a soulless cash grab.

Gone are the days of genuine strategic game-play and immersive experiences. In their place, we are bombarded with a nauseating array of in-game purchases, skins, and emotes, all designed to empty players' wallets rather than enrich their gaming experience. What was once a community-driven game now feels like a shameless money-making scheme, orchestrated by faceless corporate overlords who care little for the game's original vision or its dedicated player base.

The essence of Squad has been diluted, its soul stripped away in favor of profit margins and shareholder satisfaction. Players are no longer soldiers fighting for a cause; they are mere consumers, endlessly enticed to spend more money on virtual trinkets that add nothing of substance to the gameplay.

The transition from American to Chinese ownership has only exacerbated the game's decline, as cultural nuances and player expectations have been disregarded in favor of profit-driven decisions. What remains is a hollow shell of what Squad once was—a cautionary tale of corporate greed run amok.

In conclusion, the current iteration of Squad is a bitter disappointment, a betrayal of the trust and loyalty of its once-devoted fan base. Unless drastic changes are made to steer the game back on course, it is destined to fade into obscurity, remembered only as a cautionary tale of what happens when greed triumphs over passion and integrity.

YOU KILLED SQUAD"
i love this game it is so good :)
was better before all the effects and mortar....
"Graphically and map wise its really nice. Its just not fun, its not engaging and its not friendly to newbies. The update has rebound all my keys. Yes its a steep learning curve, I just don't think its worth it."
takes for ever to load
"No, just so Dantes doesnät buy it.. Otherwise yez."
"Don't get me wrong, this game is really cool, but you'll need to spend a lot of time to understand the game, basically everybody that plays is a professional sergeant for some reason.

If you want a game to get a quick kill every minute or so, this game isn't for you"

Server admins need to figure out how to make map and faction voting work but would be better if they never added it.
"it used to be fun before the infantry combat overhaul

update: there are mods that make the game fun again. one of them is Global Escalation."
Battlefield but boring and poorly optimized.
please pleeeeease turn off voip during voting phase. Love this game and didn't leave a review before but I am now in the hope this gets seen by devs. It's so irritating listening to the arguments.
you turned my 40gb game to an 80gb game with emotes
Very bad optimization which makes it just not fun overall

1. Hype up mil sim
2. Release Buggy Mess

"I think the First Person Shooter aspect of this game is now absolute garbage and the only way to enjoy my time on this game is playing the Star Wars Galactic Contention mod. Combat in first person only vanilla (mostly) feels extremely sluggish and pretty much just promotes me to instantly grab a specialist kit so I can sit in a bush and pray that I don't get shot from some random undisclosed location. Sure, the rest of the game is great, and I think that the way that you can command and go about it with a strategy is fairly nice. As well as a compliment on the Armor system and how it interacts with other classes within the game. However, as I stated the PVP is sluggish and promotes nothing but sitting down for 10 minutes and praying that I don't get killed from another guy with a 10x scope that can see everything if he just climbs on a rock and also prays that nobody can see him. Even if I do get a setup I'll probably be dead anyway to any other aspect in the game like armor and whatnot. Yes, I think I'm aggressive with my playstyle, however the way that Defense and Attack is promoted in this game only rewards prone players with ranged weapons. I feel like any time I try to ""play for the team/objective"" I'm kinda just throwing my body at a location after enough Armor support or artillery to hopefully capture it. Nobody is playing this game like Ready or Not, Six days in Fallujah, and whatever other games they're trying to model the infantry system around. A huge majority of players are casual, and I honestly don't think I've ever seen anyone in this game play the game with actual strategies from an Infantry perspective. Absolute Garbage, but sometimes fun - Especially on the Star Wars servers which for some reason are mostly dead. 5/10

(edit)

As of writing this it is 3/26 '24 
I am currently waiting for the Galactic Contention mod to come back online due to the update breaking the game yet again. I am very bored. So I decided to read through some reviews of this game and noticed that in my review from whenever the hell I did review this game, I left out a key point, this being that In my time in the game I never didn't experience teamwork regardless of the ICO update being out. Any positive review in favor/support of the ICO update just advocates for more teamwork being promoted. I personally don't see it. ICO pretty much just punishes any casual or even experienced player in dealing with harder PVP, meaning that if you don't have a red dot and a frag grenade, you won't win CQB engagements, because all of infantry is now a ranged fight, with anyone focusing on Close quarters being extremely punished which makes no sense in regards to the HUGE CQB maps, which is pretty much every single Middle Eastern map, and more. I find that many reviews in favor of ICO often state and understand that the game was being moved in a faster pace, an ideal that Offworld didn't yet understand how they wanted to implement. Previous gameplay was much more favorable to casual and even regular players and that's why the game got extremely popular, which is a common trend now, where people get extremely hyped for a random game everyone plays it for a month and then it dies from media because nobody plays it as much as they did. I know that this game has it's own audience and did not die, and that the media portion pretty much randomly happens to games and then doesn't entirely effect it if it has its own actual playerbase. However, what I'd like to mention is that Offworld made ICO to Slow down gameplay because it was ""too fast paced"" which is understandable that they want it to go in a different direction, but they could've done it in a different or better way. The whole ""Teamwork and synergy"" topic isn't really that huge. I personally think there's plenty of counters to people that want to ""lone wolf"" and that's pretty obvious because it was already in the game. You can literally kick people from your squad, hell on most servers you can kick them for any reason you want! And regardless old PVP and New PVP, if it's just one dude odds are he won't win any fight against a large group if he doesn't have a Sniper and at least a couple hundred meters away from the people this person decides to engage.
When I first played before ICO and during the beginning of it, I noticed that the Social aspect was a lot more alive, and that's mostly because people played the game because it was enjoyable. Now, even if I yap the whole session and talk to multiple squads, I find it hard to find people that are willing to engage in a large social aspect. ICO literally destroyed the game and it's popularity mainly because it now drives away players unless they A. Lie to themselves while playing regular Infantry B. Play Armor/Leader roles C. Play the game with friends or run modded. Sure, I can play a couple vanilla infantry rounds, squaddy or not, I can't help but feel like something's missing, or at least the game could be more fun. 
If you decide to buy this game I highly recommend that you consider Galactic Contention as your primary source of gameplay. You should play Vanilla and modded Squad if you so wish, and I recommend that just so you can gain an opinion on the game's overall state, and what the shell of the game is like. I am an extreme advocate for Galactic Contention because this game modded is quite literally the Star Wars game we never got, and is probably the best mod on any game I've played to exist, simply because it's pretty much a whole different game. Cheers.

Yet again, on April 3rd '24 I will yet again state something about the game. I find that combat makes sense to have CQB loadouts and Long range weaponry/loadouts. However that isn't really an option and you can't exactly pick/customize how you want your weapon to be. I do think that it makes sense to pick the right kit, but the way that the game works doesn't exactly make sense for that because of constant movement because of POIs constantly being updated on the map. I think that combat still works, but is extremely sluggish and punishing on vanilla. Galactic Contention has absolutely perfected and fixed that problem except for some ranged scopes on weapons, which do have crazy weapon sway. This game is good, but some major changes are flawed and can be balanced. It is only a matter of listening to the playerbase, and getting an idea on how they want to shift the game."
"My soldiers arms are made of ramen noodles and the only gun hes ever held must of been a nerf gun because the mf cannot run for more than 20 steps without blowing chunks out of pure exhaustion, let alone aim the weapon without shaking like a disabled ice spice trying to throw ass with his battle rifle"
"I shouldn't need to explain why doubling down on making a slow game slower consistently, in addition to further enhancing the extreme advantage you already had in this game while defending is a bad idea.

Its not even slower in a ""fun"" realistic way - it just feels like dogshit to take 20+ minutes to walk somewhere to die because your noodle ass arms can't aim at a guy 20 feet away - or getting suppressed by rounds hitting a wall 2+ walls away from you - it just doubles down on literally every bad feature in any recent FPS game to make what was once enjoyable now like playing the worst parts of metro in bf3.

TLDR - Inertia is dogshit in tarkov, and OWI is stupid enough to not learn from the ""other"" ""realistic"" game to not fuck with movement - go play project reality instead - its better and free."
MEA Faction is SUCK VERY VERY SUCK
"doodoo booboo stink ass game, doodoo map voting, everyone stupid and TURKISH"
"This game was one of my favorites when it first released, but the past few years now, any time an update comes out (very often), I have to redownload the ENTIRE game. 60mb update? Prepare for a 100+ gb download then. Absolute worst experience when trying to play with friends and I have to tell them I can join in 2 hours. This is also the only game where my download speed drops to single digits constantly. Most other downloads I average 45-60mbps."
I wonder how many players you lose because you wait in a 15 minute que to enter the game and then it crashes. Im running the game on a top of the line gaming pc... no other game has the same amount of issues as this one does. Open OFFICIAL SERVERS... stop being cheap!
i hate this community
no
"cant join friends, cant see friends, 60% walking, 30% waiting to spawn fuck this game"
"sadly they ruined this game. it still has the best community ever, but after several attempts to play after the suppression ""update"" it has never been the same. if they could have implemented a system that achieved a more difficult system while keeping the fun things would have been great."
"You probably saw a youtuber playing this game and thought it could be fun. Well...no. Unless you're a part of some clan or whatever. If you're not and want to play with some randoms, there's about 1 in 10 chance that your match will fun. The remaining 9 will be filled with randoms forcing you to play squad leader because nobody ever wants to do it. You like being a squad lead all the time, trying to force a group of Arabic speaking people to listen to you? If so, then you're gonna have fun. Otherwise...no, it's not as funny as CCs make it out to be"
FIX YOUR SERVER BUGGED SERVER LOBBY FFS
Decided to finally start playing this game again after around 6 months of not touching it which is around when the new “update” came out and god I can’t stand it now. The gun play is just absolutely awful now. I understand they were going for realism balance but this is far from it. I have a lot of experience shooting firearms in real life from long range to 3 gun competitions and all I can say is I think a 5 year old could control a rifle better than my character can now. Your sight goes black for like 2 seconds when you ads. Your gun sways way more than it should. Don’t even try to rapid fire with a magnified optic. I just feel like gun fights now within 100m are just completely random on who wins because you can’t shoot quick at all without your sight going black and your gun rising to the moon. It’s just absurd. I genuinely feel like my character has cerebral palsy. I pray they change this because the old squad was a great game now it’s just a fraction of what it used to be.
Shooty shoot… realistic tho
"Game is a shell of what it once was. Even after all these years, they're still figuring out core mechanics of the game with endless changes to gunplay. I reinstalled the game after 18 months to an absolute shit show. I used to think pub squad was bad - now it's so horrible. The sheer number of blueberries that have absolutely no idea what's going on in the game is astounding. The game used to centre around a 'squad', that worked together with other 'squads' to achieve a team goal. Now all you have is mindless no-micers with spagetti arms running for 20km because no one can figure out how to place a fob/hab, and when they do, they put it on an irrelevant objective, 3 points behind the active cap.

Don't buy this absolute garbage game."
was fun for the first few days i played but it got boring super quick and just tried picking up the game again and kept getting kicked from squads one several servers when i had just joined them and didnt even get a chance to spawn in
"the one that say it took forever to aim and the solder having no stamina were right. this game mask very unrealistic game mechanic with ""realistic"". like imagine training 2 year, just for you run 20 meter and cant aim a gun that you train with for 2 year, it just took too long for steady aim. the server too...damn they really depend on the community dont they? not even 1 official server on SEA."
"this game is terrible, don't recommend"
"After the ICO ""update"" in 2023 aiming and running feels like they put a 400 pound fat kid in a kit and told him to try his best in the field. The sway is unmanageable, the rear site sways and takes 3 seconds to zero in with the front site, and you can only run 15 meters before needing to sit down and take a break for 20 seconds. And these maps are huge.

Just play Hell let loose or arma at this point."
it way to weird and team killing is super bad cuz if the dev idea ti make each units uniform the same and the aiming is so bad not a recommended game for people haveing fun
too expensive
fuck off
After the new Infantry Overhaul update this game has gone to a dumpster fire. This is what happens when you sell out to a chinese company for the profit instead of keeping up with your promises. Snakes in the Grass
