5472,i got this game because it was recommended to me as a somewhat newer game with decent graphics that actually has regular non team deathmatch online play which is hard to find anymore since the game companies seem to want to focus on team play. nobody is playing doom online. i can wait for an hour in the lobby and nobody shows up. it doesn't matter what time of day or night it doesn't matter what region i set nobody shows up making this game utterly worthless for multiplayer which was the only reason i bought it.
7617,i bought payday 2 on steam i want my steam features i don't care about more public players i play with my stream friends and that functionality is now so broken its not even funny. when i only care about playing with friends breaking the friend system is a big deal. i wish i could refund this game i would have never bought it in this state. its bullshit that they can ruin games with mandatory patches after i buy it.
772,standard unbalanced triple a moshpit slop. not terrible but not good iether buy if its sub 10 on a discount. also i cant even play it anymore because it crashes when i try to load a multiplayer game and ea support just doesnt work.
2069,tried to play enter a game and frikkin jitter freeze made it unplayable tried to fix it with 9 milion ways but to no avail this game is for the trash bin!!!!!!! whoever reads this download it but if you get jitter leave you cant fix it.
916,ea splash screen death to my fav jump in jump out game. d o g shit
7557,they broke it and im not buying the 3rd game till this is fixed just goes to show that overkill doesnt really care about its community ie lemme break my cash cow right before our next game comes out in hopes the players from 2 with all its bloated content to get on 3 with its bare bones launch. spent way to much money on this just to have somebody break it. never again overkill.
341,dumbass game with a decent play style though. unreal stories missing story parts of wwii cheaters won't get banned and few servers are playable. every time the game is on sale a bunch of new idiots rush in so the veteran players can have their fun. it was great when the game was first published and the dice team was like they got brain cancer or something. they decided to make another shitty game bf2042 which i requested for a refund after 10 mins playtime. respawn points are dumb as hell either far away and become moving targets either too close or just respawn right on the enemy's face.
3250,cheating
3089,this game is broken mess worse than valorant.
3884,for those planning to play doom 2016 on i m too young to die difficulty i know i gave a thumbs down and i genuinely didn t want to. this is easily one of the best games of all time. it has everything flawless graphics a gripping storyline and fights that are both challenging and creative. so why the thumbs down? spoiler alert near the end the game throws a couple of demons at you that push the difficulty to an unreasonable level. honestly it took all the fun out of it. my thumbs are blistered as i write this and my controller is threatening to call the cops for abuse. i couldn t finish the game and this is my petty revenge.
