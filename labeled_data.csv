review,label
i got this game because it was recommended to me as a somewhat newer game with decent graphics that actually has regular non team deathmatch online play which is hard to find anymore since the game companies seem to want to focus on team play. nobody is playing doom online. i can wait for an hour in the lobby and nobody shows up. it doesn't matter what time of day or night it doesn't matter what region i set nobody shows up making this game utterly worthless for multiplayer which was the only reason i bought it.,Production
i bought payday 2 on steam i want my steam features i don't care about more public players i play with my stream friends and that functionality is now so broken its not even funny. when i only care about playing with friends breaking the friend system is a big deal. i wish i could refund this game i would have never bought it in this state. its bullshit that they can ruin games with mandatory patches after i buy it.,Operations
standard unbalanced triple a moshpit slop. not terrible but not good iether buy if its sub 10 on a discount. also i cant even play it anymore because it crashes when i try to load a multiplayer game and ea support just doesnt work.,Design
tried to play enter a game and frikkin jitter freeze made it unplayable tried to fix it with 9 milion ways but to no avail this game is for the trash bin!!!!!!! whoever reads this download it but if you get jitter leave you cant fix it.,Production
ea splash screen death to my fav jump in jump out game. d o g shit,Operations
they broke it and im not buying the 3rd game till this is fixed just goes to show that overkill doesnt really care about its community ie lemme break my cash cow right before our next game comes out in hopes the players from 2 with all its bloated content to get on 3 with its bare bones launch. spent way to much money on this just to have somebody break it. never again overkill.,Production
dumbass game with a decent play style though. unreal stories missing story parts of wwii cheaters won't get banned and few servers are playable. every time the game is on sale a bunch of new idiots rush in so the veteran players can have their fun. it was great when the game was first published and the dice team was like they got brain cancer or something. they decided to make another shitty game bf2042 which i requested for a refund after 10 mins playtime. respawn points are dumb as hell either far away and become moving targets either too close or just respawn right on the enemy's face.,Operations
cheating,Operations
this game is broken mess worse than valorant.,Production
for those planning to play doom 2016 on i m too young to die difficulty i know i gave a thumbs down and i genuinely didn t want to. this is easily one of the best games of all time. it has everything flawless graphics a gripping storyline and fights that are both challenging and creative. so why the thumbs down? spoiler alert near the end the game throws a couple of demons at you that push the difficulty to an unreasonable level. honestly it took all the fun out of it. my thumbs are blistered as i write this and my controller is threatening to call the cops for abuse. i couldn t finish the game and this is my petty revenge.,Production
i hate a game that has so much potential only to let you down. it reminds me of my ex wife you think you got something good then the nightmare starts.,Production
lots of bugs,Production
unplayable game,Design
played it with friend long ago on multi the game feels bad kinda funky in a way didn't really enjoy it,Production
no,Design
fucking let le skip your shit animations. they are fucking horrible and make no fucking sense.you butchered the people whom fought in this war and made them sound like littel faggots. fuck dice. fuck battlefield devs. they all deserve to burn.,Production
ea need to get over themselves with their anti cheat crap!! i just want to play the single player version but when i go to load it comes up with the latest version of ea anti cheat is required to play! it installed the crappy anti cheat after i wasted my time downloading 90gig worth of data!! if the latest version isn't on the game files then too bad! i shouldn't have to jump through bloody hoops just to play a game that i've paid good money for!!!! what a joke!!,Design

it requires a separate launcher. it's woke. its campaign is too short.,Operations
with drx or dlss the game is unplayable. yes i know it was early days and they subtly warn you in the settings but even without it the game still runs terribly. transport and camera constantly twitch like they're lagging behind the render. with all complex settings turned off i m getting an average of about 100 fps but 1 lows drop to 30 40 and of course the dips always happen at the worst moments. i spent some time researching and found tons of articles and discussions about people experiencing inconsistent fps and performance drops on the pc version. you have to tweak settings disable dx12 stick to medium quality and so on but i m over it. a mainline aaa title from a major studio with a 200 million budget shouldn't run like this.,Design
apex is offering another perk simply click to uninstall and you'll free up 82.75gb of hard drive space for free.,Production
unable to connect ea server,Production
need origin to play it.,Operations
garbage game,Operations
i only played campaign so here's the review for the campaign. it sucked. the story was great but the gameplay is repetitive. only the the last tiger campaign that felt different and the greatest one . compared to battlefield 1's campaign it's just bad.,Production
buggy af,Design
nothing spec rly...,Operations
literally unplayable. the back button doesnt work in the main menu forcing me to alt f4 every time i restart the game i have to play through the unskippable intro again forgets all my settings. i am not playing the intro mission for the third time,Operations
next game is going to have child soldiers if this garbage keeps up.,Production
got bored fast recommend if you want something temporary to play and waste you'r money,Operations
dying simulator all i can say,Operations
enfia o tank junto com o avi o no,Production
lag,Production
cant even launch this shit. i hate ea games,Production
the game is a joke. buggy tanks are too strong hit reg and dsync are a joke im playing cheaters and for some reason there are women running around the battlefields of ww2.,Design
fuck you garbage ea server,Operations
terrible game literally cannot see any players in this game regardless of graphic settings. they just blend in with everything i can hear them great but thats all. visibility is the worst of any fps i've played and thats like 15 years of experience. i would rather deal with sbmm in cod than not be able to see where im being shot from. game is for rats do not buy!,Operations
poorly polished game bad in game mechanics horrible sound design and childish campaign. would never recommend after playing such an amazing game as battlefield 1.,Operations
hard to say that is worth to buy. lots of teams and squads playing in group than sometimes can eliminate the whole lobby and there is nothing you can do about it. if you are going to play alone i cannot recommend it.,Design
i love not being able to regenerate my health! random recoil spread to recoil conversion is a very good idea for a video game guys! i love being laserbeamed across the entire map from a location that i didn't even know existed! if you caught on the sarcasm just go play battlefield 4 3 through venice unleashed or bad company 2 through rome.,Production
this game sucks dont buy it also peatear just went 1 and 9,Operations
unplayable with the glitches and hackers,Design
i down vote every game that has 3rd party account required,Operations
poor optimization constantly getting disconnected from games even though ping is in single digits. online games are filled with hackers cheaters and nothing is being done about them typical ea which is a shame since online can be quite enjoyable without hackers.,Operations
really great software ea. i just love how changing any of my monitor settings either crashes the game or makes my pc restart. well done.,Operations
this game sucks,Production

could've been better if there is no 500 lvl cheaters suck my nuts ea worst game ever,Operations
game is buggy asf. cant even play it for some reason and ea will always kick you out of ur profile for some reason.,Operations
team can not ptfo,Production
i hate the snipers,Operations
ea blocks all proton wine and steam deck users. alienating an entire community from playing can't recommend bad business practices.,Operations
i can't event play game. rtx 4070 super can't event play with 60fps. optimize so bad,Design
the game is very unoptimized playing with friends. keep getting kick out of the game,Design
big l for battlefield v! why the sigma cant i simply pick the side i want to play? why cant we choose sides when the teams are already balanced? the inability to switch sides of this game is incomprehensible thats why i uninstalled,Production
not worth the 2euro,Production
this game is mediocre as hell. the visuals are good everything else sucks. the characters are cringe y with bad voice acting. the maps are uninspiring even more so when you take into account that this is a wwii game. the gunplay is arcade y. there is no hardcore mode. this and 2042 feel like temu battlefield are soulless rubbish. save time and money and play bf4 and bf1.,Operations
going from bf1 to this slop was insane whiplash. extreme downgrade in every aspect. nordlys campaign in particular was especially disgusting.,Operations
the game doesn t even work on the steam deck. waste of money. i was really looking forward to playing it.,Operations
stick a rod in my balls and shoot a load on my chest cus holy fk this game is annoying,Production
battlefield. for the fifth time. remember war never changes. btw bf1 better.,Production
the audio is trash. selected every setting and saved it didn't do a damn thing. removed my headset played through the speaker and it was the same result. single player is similar to shorts on youtube. multiplayer is like finding a needle in a haystack. good luck finding a match.,Design
game dynamics suck. this game is big pile of steaming turd. stay away from it.,Production
logged in after three years of not playing just to see all my progress was wiped contacting ea support did nothing.,Design
battlefield 1 better,Production
bf1 was better,Operations
the gameplay feels worse than bf1 is too light and arcady for a war setting. on that the historicity of this game is atrocious and made me very angry as an historian who enjoys games. the game looks a bit prettier than bf1 but it's optimazation is worse surprising since it's the same engine 5 v 10,Design
tankfest the game honestly crazy how one mechanic just makes this game unplayable garbage. like this make black ops6 look good. actual trash no real fps skill needed just tank sit on hills and be a lifeless loser i actually refunded my 2.50 for this trash can't even justify that price for how garbage it is,Operations
takes 10 minutes to boot up,Operations
women screaming in pain that make your ears bleed. you got bunch of custom characters custom weapon skins that further ruin the immersion. gun play is so arcadey its pathetic little to no recoil whatsoever. and the downed feature where you are waiting for a revive is downright the dumbest game feature added to any battlefield game takes so long to respawn. the only pros are incredible graphics and sound design but everything else is just disappointing. this game will forever go down as a shit stain in the battlefield franchise and straight up disrespects ww2 in every way possible.,Operations
such a massive step back from bf1 arguably the best battlefield game they've made. it's actually that much of a step back it really makes you wonder what the hell were they thinking. all they had to do was basically re skin bf1 and it would've been incredible,Design
spawn. die. spawn. die. spawn. die. spawn. die. spawn. die. spawn. die. repeat. 2 10.,Production
gameplay is normal battlefield fare actual gunplay is fine fluid and plays well. there are some minor quirks such as animation locking that you can't avoid such as when you get tossed an ammo or medpack however generally its a smooth experience. the problem is twofold the monetization and the cheating. monetization is god awful and you're forced to do unfun co op missions to get a healthy amount of company coin if you wish to avoid spending real money. cheating is rampant on dice official servers people blatantly aimbotting on fresh accounts or old ones teleporting but the major issue currently is also plaguing the community servers which previously acted as a bastion against cheating and abuse but are now also facing problems. people can join into any server as a spectator and force crash the server and if the community isn't actively moderating there's nothing that can be done. unfortunately the community servers for this game have been mostly abandoned with admins mods just simply not bothering. dice games especially ones on maintenance mode end up turning into cheater ridden or exploitative messes at the end of their life. for 3 it was worth the time but the frustrations began piling on after servers kept being crashed and nothing is being done.,Design
the fucking leafs can block a kar98 bullet its absolute bullshit,Design
this game is so unbalanced and doesn't make any sense for the time period. no hardcore mode. dog shit mechanics.,Design
fuck you ea can't easy install play. got error on start up to turn on game from your distribution platform. fuck you!,Production
the games pretty fun if your a good player the action and fast paced gameplay is what i like to see. although as for the campaign they are just trashy and buggy while i cant even play them if i wanted too since i just get nocliped or stuck halfway through i don't get what the problem is and i'm not looking foward to fixing it,Design
sh t game,Production
i am going to not recommend battlefield v because i look at it from the modern battlefield perspective which is characterised by excessive destruction. there i find battlefield v to be significantly lacking. perhaps a bit puritanical from my perspective but i can't see battlefield v as a true battlefield. however if you're looking for a less modern battlefield and for something more in the vain of late early mid 00s wwii shooters then this is actually a decent option.,Production
not fun,Operations
okay let's be honest installing ea anti cheat is acceptable since other games nowadays have the same e.g. cs2 team fortress 2 but for valve games it's built into the game as their devs of steam . here the game doesn't recognize it i managed to launch the game only on the 3rd attempt because the previous attempts returned an error that the anti cheat program was outdated. the next account check i didn't receive a security code for 10 minutes and after a while my mailbox received a spam of 3 emails i asked for a confirmation code three times . finally the gameplay after a quick setup of the controls weapons for each class i joined multiplayer sessions with my friends and at first three times in a row after appearing i couldn't move. the matches themselves are not interesting because of the presence of cheaters regardless of your system and the only way out is to start or join another game. definitely the game does not deserve to be purchased i received it as a gift however i will remove this game from my library in the end.,Design
a washed down sweatier version of bf1,Production
just cheaters no way to compete against them,Operations
too many cheaters. i've ran into 3 4 games where there was a hacker dominating the whole team making the game unplayable.,Operations
fcuk you ea,Operations
buns game dead servers sweaty cunts who dont get off will shit on you worse than seige,Design
its aight...,Operations
invasive anti cheat collecting players information janky unfun gameplay and the worst absolutely laziest singleplayer if you can even call it that. also tons of obvious cheaters apparently they are left to be despite the invasive anti cheat? virtually nothing has been improved yet many things drag behind earlier iterations say battlefield 4 for example. map design has been awful for a long time and decline just won't stop. not worth any money to get slapped by cheaters and bad game design plus intrusions in technical aspects,Design
worse battlefield 1,Operations
too many cheaters. current anticheat cant deal with autospawn killing which stops all players from playing and the last update for anticheat has been years. the game is dead until the new one. classic ea. i will remove this review for 5.99 if ea is reading this.,Operations
the campaign is great do not misunderstand me but optimization... my lord even if on my pc with rtx 2060 this game lags as hell i don't know what will happen with weaker devices. good luck completing this laggy excuse of a battlefield which lazy holes from ea didn't optimize properly.,Operations

battlefield 1 is way better then this,Operations
the game has lots of wasted potential.,Operations
