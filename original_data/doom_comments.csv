why
"Having loved Doom 3, Gave this one a try.
The game's main premises is simple - Run & Gun with no proper compelling storyline.
Gets redundant very quickly."
"I don't like doing this, but I have to say coming back to this game isn't fun for me...

Bear in mind, ""not recommend"" doesn't mean that I hate this game or those who enjoy it. I might even try it again in the future, because I think it does quite a few thing very well.

The thing is...this game isn't what it is advertised as or what people remember it as. What do I mean? Think of Doom 2016 and all that plays in every mind palace, mine included, is sweet music going ""dudda-dudda doodleoodleoodle dudda-dudda-dudda"" as beefy guns go ""chunk-chunk-chunk"" and ""pa-kow pa-koom!"" while demons get ripped apart...YEAH!!!

But that isn't nearly the whole game. Gracious me...the platforming and you know I'm right. Have mercy...the hard stop cutscenes, where my guy who rips demons in half stops EVERYTHING to watch a woman hobble her way to an elevator. Bruh, if I have to see a delivery drone fly off again...how about I get upgrades by ripping them from a demon?

Then, the combat isn't nearly as good as we remember. What was fun and fast and frenetic during the dark days of the corona-times, when I first played the game, is just dull, lifeless circle-strafe this and hitscan, hitscan, oop! I hit a rock and now got sucker punched by a demon and now I'm dead...yawn, wake me up when the game loads back up, thanks.

I respect what the game did, absolutely, but heaven above I'm tired of circle-strafing brown/black/red enemies in brown/black/red environment. I don't care about this story. I don't care about these characters. I don't care about these enemies or the environments...every time I come back to Doom 2016 I just get bored.

It did what it did when it did it. Again, I respect that we finally got a game that didn't have to have armed mercenaries show up so we could have gratuitous Call of Duty combat with chest high walls...yeah I'm looking at you, AvP! But coming back to this, I just don't like it. 

It's been the better part of a decade and it is okay to acknowledge that something isn't a great as I remember. Again, if you like the game, don't let my words take that from you, but it is equally okay to acknowledge that the game is by no means some flawless work of the divine just because it has some good character animations.

I value Doom 2016's presence in gaming's history, even as I can't recommend it."

my eyes got damaged and too much red stuff
"I think it's hilarious that the monsters are basically piñatas. You get bonus goodies for slicing them open with a chainsaw. 
The text lore is entertaining, and the UAC seems like satire of real world corporations. 
The arcade mode is a nice feature, along with the exploration fetish, easter eggs, and other tributes to original DOOM. 
I don't have to mention how exquisite the soundtrack is. 
I've only unlocked three of the classic DOOM maps, and two of them were basically empty rooms with some items. I groped around for hidden panels and found nothing. Testing the maps from the menu selection proved that this was some kind of glitch.

The capacity for optimization is impressive, but that should be expected from a game that was marketed on gaming console systems. I would probably get much better performance if I ran the game off of an SSD in a dedicated operating system.
Ultimately, I cannot recommend this game because of the curse of DRM, and also because of the satanic iconography and demon glyphs. The visual context of a hell wrought game world is one thing, but the prominence of satanic icons in interface graphics is just cursed. 
It would be funny if one could activate a piñata graphical mod like in Gunman Taco Truck. ""Festive"" mode. Maybe someday this ""intellectual property"" can change hands so that I can enjoy it without steam, and maybe I can mod out some of the annoying interface graphics. I did replace the hell loading screen.
Let go, bethesda, you whore. Let this game go to GoG and other DRM-free platforms. Give us access to earlier versions, betas, and any console or region exclusive content.
All Glory to Jesus Christ."
"Doom 2016 doesnt work.  I did when it was new.  Now its goes black screen everytime .  
Same with WWE 2k15"
"Frankly, not that fun on m&k. The sound design is lacking, leaving guns feeling like they have no real feedback. The UI is horrendous to navigate, and the finishers just feel like glorified cutscenes breaking the pace of fights. It feels like everything about it was designed around consoles, and the game greatly suffers for it."
"Brilliant action surrounded in tedious level design and a so-so story some of those levels I had to complete in multiple sessions because they were so tiring/boring, also one of my achievements never unlocked for getting all of the runes in the campaign so why bother for the last collectable if the same might happen again, maybe only buy on sale but i won't be recommending this over-hyped game of the decade to anyone,"
i dont know what to put in this review. its just not fun
"I really wanted to enjoy this. I cannot, really boring game-play,  bad story, horrible gore."
"Crashes EVERY time I get to gold level on arcade foundry.  

EDIT nag screen from Steam.... would I like to revise my revew....  YES... Its doing it on other levels too but not just when you reach Gold."
save file keeps corrupting and screwing me over. i was almost finished with the campaign when the file corrupted. happened twice since installing it a month ago. save your money and frustration
"Some time ago, I really don't remember when, I bought DOOM, but I don't think that I played it.  Then, I was interested in maybe purchasing DOOM Eternal, so I decided I would check out the DOOM franchise by playing the one I got.  Man, I was lucky that I did that because by the time I got totally fed up with the BS map (designed by a 3rd grader no doubt - super scientific and all of that) I cam to realize what the ""Eternal"" part of the title meant.  So, after running around and around and around and around and around and around and around and around I reached that solemn point of ""Maximum Boredom"" and decided there just had to be better things to do with my life than this junk.  Now, for the nerds and introverts out there who really have nothing going on in their lives this is probably great fun.  Why they can brag to their friends that they spent another wasted evening wading thru garbage.  I guess that the idea of paying money for a ""challenge"" is kind of a stupid thing to do from the get-go, especially when the challenge quickly melds into total boredom.  So, thanks to this DOOM I have realized that investing in any further stupidity would be a double waste, i.e. time AND money.  My suggestion for something a bit more entertaining would be to teach yourself to read ancient Sanskrit."
"this game is the worst game i have ever played, truely horrible."
One of the greatest games of all time. Would have liked to play it again in 2025 but it won't start.
"No thanks. The Quake games had more satisfying weapons.
- They nerfed the shotgun! How can a game be called ""Doom"" and trash the shotgun?! It's weak and has barely any range.
- Plastic looking, bullet sponge enemies.
- Unskippable blah blah blah blah blah blah blah who cares cut-scenes.
- An anorexic old lady named Olivia is the main villain at first. What a threat!
- They really lean into the Doom guy being infused with demonic powers instead of just a regular doomed space marine.

It is way more satisfying to play Brutal Doom (a free mod) on the original WAD files, or with some of the custom maps and episodes."
this is just quake 4
"Repetitive, and boring."
"This game while amazing saves all of your progress on one ""campaing save"" - it crashed on me, and the save got corrupted, losing me 13h progress with no hope of recovery, no backups or anything. 
Honestly i can't understand why they've introduced such asinine way to track player's progress :("
"(For those planning to play DOOM 2016 on “I’m Too Young to Die” difficulty)
I know—I gave a thumbs down and I genuinely didn’t want to. This is easily one of the best games of all time. It has everything: flawless graphics, a gripping storyline, and fights that are both challenging and creative.
So why the thumbs down?
(Spoiler alert)
Near the end, the game throws a couple of demons at you that push the difficulty to an unreasonable level. Honestly, it took all the fun out of it. My thumbs are blistered as I write this, and my controller is threatening to call the cops for abuse.
I couldn’t finish the game—and this is my petty revenge."
SINGLE PLAYER GAME THAT ASKS YOU TO CREATE A BETHESDA ACCOUNT? FUCK YOU TODD HOWARD
"Sadly the game crashed in the second to last level and my save got corrupted. Up until then it was fun, but this is a gamebreaking (literally) bug."
"This game is ass in terms of gameplay who says its ""fast paced"" never played a real fast paced game, It's slow and if u tryna play on higher difficulty it's ass, you can't even more around freely, the movement fucking sucks, I reinstalled it a few days ago and said ""I got doom eternal and played it instantly but I have just a few hours of DOOM 2016""I replayed it and it's ass, I keep seeing articles of people saying this game is better than Eternal and it's just not true, they are fucking braindead to think that. DOOM 90s Is more  fast paced than this. The game is just unskippable cutscenes and it's just not really rip and tear like people say. Overall, just buy the 90s games or Eternal I had much more fun playing on Nightmare rather than playing 2016."
"Thought I would go back and give Doom and Doom Eternal a run before the new launch. Great game, even today still a blast. That is until the platforming garbage. I forgot why I haven't enjoyed a Doom game since the original. Completely breaks the game flow. And it's only worse in Doom Eternal."
boring gameplay in my opinion. more parkour and unskippable cutscenes than ripping and tearing
"[b]IF YOU ARE HAVING STUTTER PERFORMANCE ISSUES: DISABLE STEAM OVERLAY FOR THIS GAME[/b]

Game runs really poorly for no reason, spent close to an hour trying to find a fix. Needs to be fixed by the developers ASAP. I believe this issue came after the somewhat recent Steam overlay redesign."

"The combat feels sluggish, and the doomslayer is incredibly frail."
Oyun her 1 bölümde ortalama 2-3 kere çöküyordu+ oyunu bitirmeme az kaldığında save file'ım corruptlandı ve şuan tekrardan başlama isteğim yok  absolute trash
"The environments are beautiful and the weapons feel nice when shooting, but it gets boring doing the same thing after getting all the weapons, you won't fall asleep but it gets stale."
Game so boring that I regret spending 3 dollars.
fast and fun but a bit repetitive. played it on easy b/c I suck.
"Kind of overrated? It's fun for a bit, and the gameplay is very smooth and feels very well optimised. I had no stutters or hick ups at any point in my time playing it. However, I didn't find it very engaging either. For me the ""glory kills"" mechanic sort of ruins the game. 

You'll be running and jumping around trying to dodge some enemies while your shooting down the other ones, then you press F and for a moment your character is locked in place, you can't move or look around, your crosshair disappears and you get an over the top kill animation. This doesn't stop the time in game though, the other enemies are still running around you. Once the animation is over I always felt a bit confused as to where I was and where the other had enemies gotten to while that was happening. Annoyingly, if you don't go for glory kills, you end up having to pump a lot more bullets into the enemy to kill them, which then leads to ammo issues..."
My save file has been corrupted and it's not even fixed after 9 years

"Great game, everything about it is amazing except one MASSIVE flaw, going back through old completed missions and getting collectibles, to get yourself caught up on achievements. then continuing from where you left off, restarting the mission will completely reset all completion progress made and it will save from where you started when you decided to back track on the older completed missions."
8 hours into the game it just stopped working one day. Whatever update happened in Jan 2025 makes the game unable to launch.
"I don't like the game play, mechanics and repetitiveness of the game."
Who would've thought that bethesda can make a non-glitchy game with a good checkpoint system. This isn't the game ofcourse cause they don't know what good game design is but maybe one day
good game play. Level design is mid
I have to buy a new pair of pants every time I play this game because my zipper keeps popping off
Mediocre
"multiple glitches during fights and having to restart missions, its a good game but ruined by the amount of glitches."
"I thought I'd reacquaint myself with this game before Dark Ages arrives. After getting the platinum on PS4 back in 2016, I was looking forward to the PC 'experience'.
Unfortunately, with a controller, this game is unplayable - strafing left with the joystick just does not work. 
After some research into this, the problem (or similar) seems common, but no solution works for me.

Gutted.

Not all of us have the dexterity to use a keyboard and mouse, so with no prior knowledge of the controller issue before purchasing, I cannot recommend this game to others if you too are planning to use a controller."
Runs abhorrently poorly. People share the same sentiment in forums with the issues that I have and in Eternal but there is no solution.
Game breaking progression bugs that have gone unaddressed for 9 years.
Do not download give you the blue screen of death with code of CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT no other game has done this and no its not my hardware i have a i912700kf  3080evga and 32gb of ram
Not a Christian game.

"Prodeus is much better doom, this is some polished arena with no adrenaline pump"
"Wanted a slop shooter, I got what felt like a below average slop shooter. Felt too easy even on Ultra Violence, and they locked Nightmare behind a game clear. Super Shotgun is the turning point for the next 2/3rd of the game's difficulty turning into a joke. Exploration is boring and not noteworthy. Combat is easy, gives you too much ammo, glory kills are good but don't present an interesting mid combat decision since there doesn't feel like a lot of risk. Progression system sucks, there are too many progression systems, less is more. Story doesn't matter, but I liked Darin De Paul's performance as Samuel Hayden. I hope I like Doom Eternal because this underwhelmed me."
"Boring,Too slow, S L O W

Too slow
"From Boomer shooter to ZOOMER shooter.

No."
"I've used to playing this game, when I was left to going work, hadn't playing this for a few years. I decided to uninstalled it for later when I have time. So in January 2025, I decided to downloading it because I was so freaking excited about Doom's newest game.

So after that awhile; I was starting to opening the game and it's have a black screen, I really tried to fixing the resolutions. Fixing the ""Config files."", also downloading the GPU's drivers lately. Since I was updating everything on it. Suddenly it's still offically have a black screens for me and I unable to playing this game. 

I absolutely loved this game, I was super sad that's I can't playing this game anymore since I came back to downloading it again."

"Feels so wrong to play this after Eternal, it really is just a complete downgrade in every level, way too easy too, spamming op weapons is pretty much meta. If you already played Eternal don't even bother, nothing is better here"
RESTARTING MISSION DELETES YOUR REVISITED PROGRESS WITHOUT WARNING. LOST SO MANY HOURS WORTH OF GAME PLAY BECAUSE OF THIS! SO I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME AS THAT IS A SERIOUS NEGATIVE!
This game sucks lettuce balls. Buy it if you enjoy getting launched into the sky every 5 minutes.
"Very overrated, doesn't respect your time with no manual saves, and it's a step back from The New Order."
Good revival!  Too bad about DRM on Doom Drak Ages.
I don't know what causes it and after some research this game doesn't like to run on modern hardware as far as the CPU goes. i have an R9 7950x. if there is a fix please let me know. the game lags and bounces the FPS up and down.

"Its levels stretch long. The combat is easy, and at the time of writing this, im at one of the last levels. I've died 10 times thru the 6.3 Hours I've spent on this.  The original was similar however, it was a new thing at the time. If you have a huge monitor, it will be very annoying to play, majority of it is squished."
My save file got corrupted at the very last level.
"WOW.  This is NOT an action game. It's a staring at the map game.

Third level in and I'm FED UP with his game. I'M DONE!  It's an overly complicated maze of a map that is difficult to navigate even in map mode, and I've spent more time studying the map just to figure out where to go that actually playing the game. For an ""action"" game, there is WAY too much downtime just staring at a map and figuring out what to do. After 20 minutes of trying to study and navigate an overly complicated map, i have given up because i am just lost. There is no clear indication on how to progress to the next area even after downloading the full map. There is NO clear indication on how one area connects to another. This is NOT an action game, its 80% staring at the map trying to figure it out.

On top of that, they give you challenges to complete. There have been NO opportunities in this level to complete 2 out of 3 of them that i have seen. you are supposed to kill 6 enemies of a certain type, in different ways, but they WILL not spawn thru most of the level, and when they do, like once, the mission objectives do not give you the required environmental objects to complete it. maybe it exists in a one time certain scenario, but if you mess it up, you do not get a second chance.

OK. lets replay the mission and try to get the super rare objectives done that was impossible to get the first time. Got it. Oh no look at that, it wont save your accomplishments!  as soon as you save and exit the game, they are gone like you never did them!  you get no credit for your goals after exiting the game. COOL!  as soon as you finish a level but didnt accomplish a goal that was near impossible to do, you have to restart the ENTIRE game from scratch just to get it to register, because replaying missions has absolutely no point of effect.

I've NEVER played a FPS thats so overly complicated and broken as this stupid stupid game."
"The game in principle more less, but the plot is weak, the variety is almost no, so that the game for 1 time."
画面太恶心，经常迷路
Game play is repetitive. Boring Story. Did not like it.
mid?
shitty ass fucking game
Not Recommended
"its like eternal, but bad, but we didn't know it was bad until eternal came out"
"I can't recommend due to the following reasons:
- ""Rip and tear"" they say -well, can't do that without ammo. Yep, you run out of ammo fast.
- No focus on story: Challenges and arena fights are major.
- Boss fights are totally bland: Repetitive attacks pattern and all the time another phase. One of the bosses start circling like a prima ballerina -literally.
- ""Easy"" should be relaxing, why is it the same as normal?
- Bad map design: Most of the time you get locked in an area with demons and you can only get out when you killed them all. This repeats many, many times. Really boring.
- Inconsistency in mouse speed. Sometimes it is normal, the next moment it is slower -and there is a mouse lag while in menus -IN MENUS!
- The sound quality changes many times. Example: Half a map the sound quality is like an old TV, next time it sounds like in a cave, the next map the bass got boosted.
- Heavy focus on challenges and achievements: Without them you can't upgrade your weapon and skills.
- Finish moves (Glory kills): At the beginning they're awesome but they happen so many times that it bored me out after 3 hours -and the demons recovers their hit points if you don't use the chance, so you need more ammo to kill them ...what makes the glory kills annoying and less glorious.
- A weapon does not make the same damage. Sometimes I need 2 shots for an Imp, sometimes 4, when they stand in front of me though. Same with all the other weapons."
KEEP YOUR MONEY SPEND IT IN THE REAL WORLD.
"Having played every Doom game in existence, then all the Quake multiplayer madness, I really should have liked this game. Sadly, I don’t like it and I struggled to put my finger on why. I was barely into the game, and I felt fatigued as if I were wasting my time. Then I finally figured it out. It was the pacing and the glory kill system that were the problem and there is no way to fix it. 

	I am no stranger to first-person shooters, and they all have a familiar mechanic that I really love. You shoot everything that moves until it stops moving then you look for something else to shoot. In Doom, they opted for a new mechanic where you shoot everything that moves until it moves differently, and then you glory kill it. 

	In case you’re not familiar with the term, a glory kill is where you perform a finishing maneuver on an already defeated enemy. In Doom’s case, these are short, well-animated gore fests that can be really shocking the first few times you see them. You basically shoot up an enemy until they enter a helpless state, swaying back and forth as if drunk. Then you run up to them and finish them off with a quick animated take-down. This rewards the player with a small amount of health and armor which seems to be part of the core mechanic. You need that health and armor because doom is stingy with placement of it on the map, and it can run short fast. 

	However, after your two hundredth glory kill, you have seen all the animations and they are rapidly getting boring. I got bored with it in less than an hour of play as I asked myself the eternal question. Why did they give me all these guns if I have to kill everything with my bare hands?

	It seems like they should have just given me a sword or a big hammer or something because you have to kill nearly all the monsters up close and personal, and this just gets old fast. You see, the original Doom games all had one thing in common: long-range. You did your best to engage everything from as far away as possible and focused on targets that were close to restore your range. This game is very different and encourages you to fight at very close ranges so you can get those glory kills. 

	But Omni I hear you say, you don’t have to use them. Well, that’s where you are wrong. Unfortunately, this mechanic is baked into the game's DNA and you can’t turn it off. Ammo and armor aren’t plentiful on the maps, and if you insist on shooting things to death, you will quickly discover you're low on everything. You see ammo and armor drops from every monster you perform a glory kill on, and you need those drops to survive. Using the chainsaw to finish an enemy off turns them into a loot pinata and showers you with goodies. 

	Now I love a good loot shower, but I wanted more doom where I ran about guns blazing and left a trail of dead enemies in my wake. I want to be able to kill them with my guns, and only my guns like god intended it to be. None of this, sissy; run up and kick the weakened enemy so I can get some of my bullets back. Not to mention that the kills themselves kept drawing me out of the pacing. Having to stop every three to five seconds to make another glory kill just ruins the fast-paced gunplay I was craving. 

	Now, are the graphics good? You bet they are. Some of the best I have ever seen with enemies and the aforementioned glory kills animated to perfection. The music and sounds are a solid addition, really helping to set the player's blood pumping. Level design is creative, with plenty to explore and look at. I really felt like I was on Mars in some kind of laboratory complex while hell invaded. 

	But all of those good points can’t overcome the fact that this game didn’t play like the doom I remember. I don’t care for this game, and I am very sad to say I won’t play more of it."
Who came up with this terrible idea of ​​putting melee attacks to recover health in a shooting game? It completely interrupts the flow of combat.
cant sex the revenant
Very disappointed that I can't kiss the demons as an alternative to violence.
"Great music, thanks to Mick Gordon. 

Rest sucks."
This is good in the beginning and then it just going more and more boring because of the one style game no jump scares
Glory killing a Soldier crashed my game.
wont launch
its not intering multi player mode
"super buggy, fall through floor and have to complete the same event 3 times for an achievement buggy. story is infuriating and boring somehow simultaneously. be prepared to have your shots disappear, enemies aimbot, melees bug out, no ability to sprint, dodge, slide, push etc. oh yeah, and beating the game on nightmare confers the same reward as beating it on very easy. honestly, secret hunting was more fun than actually playing the missions. I somehow upgraded every rune, yet didn't unlock the every run achievement. appearently this is a going on 9 year old bug. the only redeeming quality of this game is the amazing environment, character, surface modelers, the animators, lighting, fx, and cinematic artists. doubt they got paid what they were worth."
I don't own this game. I don't recommend this game to other players. You'll only see this 52 times because that's how many times I jumped back on the hamster wheel.
"If this was free I would turn that thumbs down into a thumbs up, maybe. I'm sorry to all the Doom fans out there, but your game is not good in the eyes of me. That matters."
"It's a fantastic game. To bad the corpos plastered it with dlc, an AGGRESSIVE eula and 97% of the main menu is adds.

Mr Gordon did a great job. The morons in suits ruin everything.

How can I get a high paying job ruining things with MY stupidity?"
No
AAAAAGGGGHHHHHH TOO SCARY!!!!!!!!
one of the rare games that give me motion sickness.
"I'm more a fan of doom 3 and the original games.

The ""gore"" genre ain't doing it for me at all and the story is basically non-existent.

You really are invincible in this game, man... it feels so ""plastic"" to just run around knowing that whatever hellish being you're going to fight you're just gonna kick ass every single time. it feels kinda ironic to play a somewhat soulless game (in terms of story, repetitive combat, etc.) while the graphics makes you want to stay around for longer.

also, it would be fine to have 12+ weapons if they would have some significance in terms of damage or usage, instead you completely rely on the quantity of ammunition so there's not really a point in having that big variety of guns whatsoever.

Maybe i was gullible thinking this was gonna build on the doom 3 story and maybe have the same mechanic foundation, but i was terribly wrong and just as disappointed.
although, as i stated,  I can't talk bad regarding the graphics... the game is absolutely beautiful and really captivates the hell-ish-horror ""everything's f*cked"" type of feel.

4/10"
"I finished it (only 33% of players have the final achievement, which says something), but it wasn't very engaging. Skip this and go straight to Doom Eternal, a truly fantastic game."
"This game is 10% fun, fast paced combat, and 90% slowly combing each level for upgrades and secrets - which is honestly boring and annoying.
So... the game is 10% good."
"I honestly don't get the hype, maybe it's just not for me but DOOM just felt like an ordinary shooter, the weapons feel floaty and yeah the soundtrack is good but it feels forced, even on the hardest difficulty the soundtrack just didn't match the experience on screen.

I was still going to play it through in hopes it just needed to 'click' but unfortunately my game save randomly corrupted part way through and I don't want to slog through the early levels again; especially as it seems like the same game save issue is still present in the sequel.

I might come back to it someday; but as it stands, it's not for me."
keeps crashing
its a real shame theres multiplayer achievements
"who decided to name this game ""doom"" like wow thats a great idea now everyone will have to clumsily tack the year 2016 onto the word everytime they mention its existence

in other news this game was way too overproduced and as a result is incredibly difficult to run, pretty much universal agreement about the banger soundtrack though, and for what its worth the visual design in the game is pretty good, gameplay i cant comment on because i havent ever reached that part and never will until i get an ibm quantum supercomputer that i can run these games on even though i shouldnt have to go that far"
"Gameplay is pretty fun.

Awful UI. Mouse keeps flying off to the second monitor invisibly and using scrollwheel would affect unfocused windows, fullscreen or borderless makes no difference. Overall just frustrating user experience

Would probably play for longer if the devs weren't lobotomized when making the pc port. Not fun when I have to spend more time troubleshooting than actually shooting demons."
"Im a fan of old fps games like doom 1 and doom 2, so i thought it would be fun to try the newer doom too. I was promised epic and unique gunfight but i got lied to. There is nothing special about the gameplay, its just WASD + M1 (and sometimes F) . It's really repetitive and i got bored after the first 10 minutes. There's nothing unique about the movement too. Also there are a lot of sections where you have to look for something, like an entrance or a key, which is boring. The only positive i can say about this game is that the soundtrack is really good and the cutscenes are really fun to watch."
Not very engaging and slow. Also uses way more system resources than it has any right to.
No microtransactions to be seen. This is a no-go for me.
"4/10 its no doom eternal
- repetitive combat 
- bland level design"
"Beautiful graphics, and smooth gameplay. However it just doesn't scratch that itch as a first person shooter. Navigating the map is frustrating, as it can be confusing, but mostly because you are going to be jumping from one platform to the next - over and over again. Combat is basically where enemies spawn in a specific area, and besides the ranged enemies, the rest force you to run around, making sure you don't fall off the cliff while you use the same close range weapon that you have been using from the start - regardless that you have others, because they just aren't effective enough at close range. I suppose this game is just not my type, when I'm more focused on where I am, then what or how I'm going to kill something. There is fun to be had with this game, but I'm not hooked enough to even rely on the story to push me to the end."
A positive review is not available in your region.
"Honestly never been a huge fan of mindless killing of enemies that put up no chance to fight back, even on hurt me plenty difficulty, and the heavy metal with slaying demons gets old pretty fast imo, going through the missions and getting the collectibles and finding all the secrets is honestly the best part of this game for me"
"killing demons on ""mars"" , yea so exciting and not repetitive and boring

Overwhelmingly Positive LOL"
"I don't understand the hype around it. The gameplay is just boring.
Weightless story, very simple and repetitive combat.
Weapons are inaccurate, you just spam and play with the timing of your attack.
Shoot, F, Shoot F, Shoot F, Shoot F."
"Это буквально худшая игра в истории, веселее крапиву бить палкой чем играть в это, хуже чем это я еще не видел игр. Если бы я только вышел из пещеры и Doom оказался бы моей первой в жизни игрой, я бы просто ушел обратно жить в пещеру, все мои предыдущие негативные обзоры в стим можно даже не рассматривать, я просто не знал что бывает настолько плохо."

This is closer to the first 2 games than eternal but honestly way less fun
this game is really boring both in campain and multiplayer
"Vastly overraterd, terrible map design, clunky mechanics, and gameplay that forces you to slow down"
"Something about DOOM (2016) just doesn't feel right. I also don't understand the hype and positive reviews.

I've been trying to get into this game since 2016, when I bought it on Steam, found it very boring and refunded during the first level. Then on PS4 Pro, I got it as a free PS Plus game, gave it two chances, months apart, and still couldn't bring myself to finish the first level. Now I bought it on Steam again at 80% discount, finally made it to level 2 and now around the middle of it. But it doesn't feel good to play, at all. I'm not going to continue. I've given it enough chances over so many years and it is one of the most un-fun games I've had the misfortune to play.

I think DOOM 3 is still the best of all the DOOM games. It has a more suspenseful and horror feel to it that none of the other DOOM games have. This one is too much like an arcade game for my taste. And extremely tedious too, having to open the map every few seconds to make sure I am on the right path and not missing any collectibles or upgrades. It completely breaks immersion and stops the momentum."
"An extremely mediocre singleplayer fps game that overstays it welcome.

It felt like I had already experienced the entire game long before I reached the final levels. It is just way too repetitive and easy. And there isnt enough content to justify finishing the game.

A few technical complaints:
- The movement is horrid, very floaty and unresponsive
- Mouse smoothing is enabled by default and can only be disabled by editing a config file
- A lot of weapons slow down your mouse sensitivty, this is unacceptable (and there is no way to disable it)
- Very buggy"
I am not going to lie I am at the start of the game and its kind of trash for now.
"This game is super over rated. 

After playing the game for 6.3 hours here are my cons and pros:

Cons:
- This game is a major collectathon, majority of upgrades are locked behind finding secrets, there are guards bodies that are usually hidden and involve constantly checking the map to try and find them, or the upgrade drones, those are less hidden but some are still tucked away. 
- The reviews (let me explain). This game has 132,632 reviews with a 95% rating at the time of writing. Only 51% percent of people have made it to the 5th mission in the game. I made it to there in 4.5 hours so most people under 3.5 hours probably haven't even made it there (I probably spent an hour or more collecting collectibles). A steam user named NourTheNegacy has left a review at 3 hours and has not made it to the 5th mission. I just don't feel like people with low hours in the game should be leaving reviews in a title, I only have 6.3 but at least I made it almost halfway through the game.
- The enemies. I just felt the cast of enemies to be super uninspiring. You have to basic guys the imps and the walker guys, then they introduce the soldiers which are like buffed up imps, then the bigger hulk demons that are just stronger walker guys, It just adds upgrades to the enemies without them feeling that different, the big fat guys feel like an soldier that can take more bullets but the attack is pretty much the same.
The pros
- The gun play is good. I enjoyed the fights except for the lack of enemy diversity, but the guns felt good I never felt unstoppable at any point but I felt I could take the enemies on.

Overall I am tired of writing I hope doom eternal is better and doesn't have upgrades locked behind secrets. I give this a 5.5/10."
I can't recommend this game to anyone.  It doesn't launch anymore.
"Awesome game, bought for the multiplayer. It is just a shame they don't have servers in South Africa so we have to play on EU servers at a disadvantage. That is the only reason I am giving this game a thumbs down. When that changes let me know and I'll give it a thumbs up."
Game is just a buggy mess
"the middest thing ive ever played, tbh this game probably goes hard af if you're a 90 IQ redditor"
"I played DOOM Eternal before buying this game. I absolutely loved Eternal: it had great movement and level desing, the combat was fun and over all the gameplay felt really good. This game however felt just the opposite: the combat was boring, all the levels were re-skins and used the same 5 assets, it was hard to figure out where you should go as everything looked the same and the parkour was basically non-existent. 

Overall, I hated the experience. (and yes I have 5.1 hr currently, but I have almost beaten the game and seen most of it)"
this game is by no means bad it just isnt a lot like the first two DOOM games which can create a lot of dissapointment. however this game is starting to grow on me its worth a try i just exprextd DOOM and got something more simalar to games like halo
"Impressive game done with a lot of attention to detail.
That being said, I just didn't want to keep playing.
It's good at everything, except intriguing."
Boring
"Just my two cents...

The handful of times I've played DOOM (with a fair break in between), I've been left underwhelmed. I don't know what it is, because there can be no doubt that it is a well developed title - the reviews alone speak for for that - but perhaps I just don't like the fast paced shooting or movement, amongst other things.

Despite the the music, visuals (for 2016), and gore being positives, I feel everything else is just OK. All things being equal this makes the game great for most people, but for me there aren't clear standouts that make me think ""Whoa, this is something else"".

I feel obliged to keep giving DOOM a chance because the discourse around it is so extremely positive.

Again, I cannot discount the 95% positive reviews because I can see why it would be loved, but I just don't feel the same way. To each their own, as they say."
"Good campaign. Good multiplayer that's tragically dead, only populated really by cheaters."
4/10. the optimization is great but the gameplay is just meh
"As a long time DooM fan. totally missed the point of DooM and the theme aesthetic. Can tell it is a modern game and not made by the iD devs who started the franchise. Too boring unfortunately, I actually waited till midnight to get a physical copy. Too boing and I cant be stuffed finishing it. Brutal DooM is better."
boring ash
"While the game might be fun, I keep running into a bug that makes it so my weapons don't shoot. In the first mission. Can't progress and it happens even in new games.

Since the game is unplayable for me, I cannot recommend this."
game lists windows 7 compatibility but does not work on 7 anymore generating 12+ dll errors when attempting to open on 7. i should not need college degree in programming to run the game on a listed supported platform. If you care about running games on vintage platforms avoid Bethesda products.
awful game
pretty fucking boring
Terrible
"I really don't get what people see in this game, especially now that we have Eternal. Doom 3 perfected the horror aspects of the franchise, and Eternal the arcade gameplay aspect. Doom 2016 stands on a crossroad, being neither as good as a horror Doom variation, nor as an arcade one. It's gameplay loop is basic and flat compared to Eternal's, you just spam super shotgun, not only because it's the most powerful weapon (and with 2016's basic loop you don't have to strategize and worry about ammo), but also beacuse it's the only one in 2016 that feels good to shoot with. Seriously, I feel like I'm using some water guns here not the real deal, it's the weakest shooting of Id Software's more ""modern"" titles (Doom 3, RAGE and Eternal all have way better gunplay)."
Marty Stratton
Can't skip cutscenes on a 2nd playthrough LOL. Unless you're playing on the highest difficulty.
"A warning to we who enjoy FPS with manual saves and who do not like puzzles and loathe platforming. 
This is not a game for you.

Checkpoint save only with challenging platforming....no way will I replay an area because I miss one jump.

Puzzles sometimes require traversing the entire map and many that are only solvable thanks to google search.....frustration and boredom.

Otherwise a very good run and gun first person shooter.
But its not for me."
I'm not sure if this is an FPS or a Super Mario game because it looks like a [i]jumping puzzle simulator[/i]. That's all I gotta say
"The first FPS I ever played, on the family IBM computer, back in 1996 was Final Doom, and this garbage made me download DOOM+DOOM II instead;
-the gun play is trash, the first ""pistol"" you get feels like a water gun.
-the shotgun look, and feels, like some clunky fake science fiction Nerf gun that makes random sound effects when you pull the trigger.
-the ""execution"" mechanic is the only fun combat, but gets really repetitive when its the only fun way to engage in combat over and over and over again.
-Destiny 2, with all of its lame silly-billy DEI nonsense, still has better combat, and is a much better example of a corridor shooter."
"I really want to like it, to give it another try, etc...
...but every time I find myself wanting to uninstall it and go play quake 1 and 2 campaigns.

Im a simple individual who likes run and gun. 
If you start adding upgrades, finishers, locked areas and just way too much eyecandy my interest decays.

Like a dish with way too many spices."
Pretty much just a music player
"pathetic developers, game goes down to 60fps on high refresh monitors 

devs still havent fixed this issue after all these years, shame on you"

"As somebody that is a completionist / achievement hunter, I cant possibly recomend this due to the multiplayer."
"This was compatible with Windows 7, however, they have ""Pray I don't alter it any further.""ed it to require windows 10 via XInput 1.4.  Ehh.  MS Be MS'in."
"I tried so many times to play this game, its a cycle of deciding to get through it, play for a few minutes, die several times in a dumb way in a single area, get mad at the limited player movement or randomly getting instakilled by a tiny creature I could crush with my pinky irl, and drop it for months. I'm literally at the end and can't push through and finish"
"If you already previously purchased the game and have it sitting in your library, absolutely, go enjoy it. Phenomenal game.

However, until Marty Stratton is no longer at the company, I cannot in good faith recommend the purchase of this game.

https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce"
"If you have a moment, boot the game up and turn the music off for your next gameplay session.  That's Mick Gordon who's missing, the composer and musician for DOOM (2016) who has been honing that sound since 2014 with Killer Instinct and Wolfenstein: The New Order.  There has been some controversy in the press about treatment of Mick during DOOM Eternal's development which you can find online in great detail.

The mistreatment of artists and freelance musicians is becoming more common, most likely due to a wide imbalance of power that has them feeling lucky that they even have work at all.  I've spoken to other game musicians and heard their stories of experiencing the same treatment.  The Cohen Brothers movie ""Barton Fink"" goes a little deeper if you'd like to understand the issue in more depth.

While things most likely won't change soon, I'd just like to speak out as a fan of Mick's work and how he was treated during the development process of DOOM Eternal.  Regardless, his hard fought work is a part of new DOOM as much as id tech.  You can turn the sound back on now, leaving it off while playing is against Article 3 of the Geneva Convention anyway."
"This game is so vastly overrated I don't even know where to start. The thing that stands out to me the most is how buggy everything is. From random spikes in damage, wonky hit boxes, frequently getting stuck on or falling through geometry, BFG rounds just dispersing without doing damage, getting launched into the air from hitting a ledge awkwardly, or getting blown backward by my own weapons glitching, the list just goes on and on. This was everything just observed from a standard play though without even really pushing the game too hard so I can't imagine how many more bugs lie waiting under the hood. 

This game is not even that complex and yet they seem to have fumbled the most basics of balance when it comes to damage, movement, and level design. Has no right to bear the DOOM name."
goes from fun to tedious at some point
"Probably the only purchase on my account I regret buying.

It's by no means a bad game, in fact, after playing almost all of the Doom games except for eternal this is probably one of the best, despite that, it's just not my thing.
Maybe my brain has began to rot from too much ultrakill but it felt awfully slow to play sometimes, even on higher difficulties and trying to use all the weapons, the truth is that most of the time you only use like 3.
It didn't really felt like what it seemed to be from reviews and trailers, even while trying to play on a reckless way on purpose, I found myself having to look often through the map to find things to make me stronger instead of running into them or earning them, aside from a couple challenges and objects you are almost forced to get. 
This wasn't terrible to play and again, by no means a terrible game, but for something to be called fast-paced and chaotic it got awfully tedious at some parts.

TLDR; Good game but just not for me"
2025 I cant skip intro))))
Just no
"I wanted to play Doom as a fps horror, playing as a badass, heavy armored Space Marine. 
Instead, i played a non-stop jumping Fortnite guy.
All weapond feel the same weight, no impact sensation."
Having to get through Checkpoints is so f.....g anoying!
"Too little ammo, boring finisher animation which ruins the dynamics and flow. I thought this game was about fun, but for me it ended up being too tedious"
"wish I could have played this game, but there's a forced arbitration clause in the EULA."
"Game file inexplicably corrupted 3 levels from 100 percenting it. It's a fun game don't get me wrong but, that'll take the wind out of anyone's sails."
Fire Marty Stratton
boring combat
"I don't like this game. I only put 15ish hours in it when it launched because we hadn't had a Doom game on PC in over a decade. The mechanics are boring, and I hate the glory kill the most of all. I mean, it's cool the first 20 times or so, but I'd prefer it if the guns just sucked less. I don't enjoy taking myself out of the action to upgrade the weapons with a weak crafting mechanic, or having to chase down drones to find some buff. Yay, give me a cool ass chainsaw and then tell me I have to go looking for a gas can every 2 kills. The levels feel small and uninteresting, I'm just running in circles in the same places like this is Quake III Arena and these demons are a bunch of AI noobs. And why do I have to chase these demons down all of the goddamn time? Why are they running from me? I'm the one that is supposed to be running and crying for my mommy, not the other way around. I just spun this up for like an hour today, because I literally forgot that it existed. I panicked slightly, thinking I had confused my hatred for Doom Eternal with a good game, but no, I hate this one too."
Snother piece of shit.
im being real

"First Doom i played was Doom 3, i remember it as horror - shooter. There is no horror element in this what is kinda sad. Just fast paced shootings and guitar riffs. Not exactly what i imagined. Will work for many. Not for me sadly."
"This game makes me so incredibly motion sick, I have tried everything I can to be able to play. 
It seems like it would be a really fun game.
If you are easily prone to motion sickness, Stay away!
Wish I could play to enjoy it. 
Not enough accessibility options to make playable."
The game constantly crashes after the second mission.  Looks like it's been an ongoing issue for some PC players for years with no fix concrete fix available.
"Constantly interrupting the pace of combat with 2 second long ""glory kill"" gets incredibly boring, very fast. Removing control from the player in a game that should encourage quick thinking and fast reflexes dulls the flow of action, and tying that mechanic down with the healing system makes it impossible to ignore it. 
The big macho man powertrip on a press of a button actually produces the reverse effect and is yawn inducing.

On a more subjective note, the music is headache-inducing but that's just my reaction to it and i'm sure it's great for some people out there, all the more power to them.

Game has other issues but i cant be arsed to even mention them cause i quit after an hour out of boredom.

I've heard the sequel solves a lot of issues from this one so i'm willing to give it a shot sometime, but until then it's back to ULTRAKILL"
"firing the plasma rifle reduces your mouse sensitivity. in a game where aim is important, why would you randomly change my mouse dpi for some weapons but not others???? also if you want to remove this stupid ""feature"" you have to install mods which will either ban you from multiplayer or prevent you from getting achievements which is just awesome"
"Unskippable cutscenes unless you nuke the videos folder. >:(
Unskippable in-game cutscenes. >:(

I tweaked the graphics, then sat around and did nothing for ten minutes while some donkey heehawed. So then I nuked all the videos from drive so I could PLAY THE GAME. Reload the game but have nothing to do, again, while an in-game cutscene happens. BORING. Fifteen seconds of actual blam-blam follows, and then another freaking in-game cutscene with some blah blah and DoF and whatever. Indicative of the remainder? Probably. Fun? No. No.

F*** THAT. Not worth it. Better DOOMs exist. REFUND!

Oh right, and plenty of ads on the main menu. Also, the main menu itself is not designed well despite the ads.

Three-and-change USD on sale and I want every cent back. 
THAT'S how much wasting my time bothers me. For that piddly amount. I've had more fun doing this dumb review than the hours spent downloading dozens of gigabytes for locale support I didn't select, videos I didn't watch, non-gameplay I didn't non-play, ads for products I don't want, and levels with checkpoints. Oh yeah! You read that right! Unskippable junk, ads, and checkpoints too! I read there's even character unlocks! Wow! It's a freaking lovechild of EA and Bethesda (the most unholy of unions!)

Are the little moments of actual pew pew any good? People say so, but I'll never know - because I'd rather you read this review back to me verbatim and slap my face every second or third syllable. Yep. It would feel just like this game, but free. Oh, and I like slow things. I love simulators. I love fast things too. Like DOOM, well, not this DOOM. But my point is that fast should be fast, and slow should be slow. Get it? I don't want to be plotting out a block of little row-houses and the mouse goes *shoom* and suddenly there's a hellish explosion of gore and little mailboxes. No. Nor do I want to be punching a freaking monster in the face and then I'm refueling an ocean-liner in real-time. Nope. One or the other. Slap me. I hate this game.

Developers were sick in the head when they made this. Do not buy this one."
ADS on the Main Screen?! Greed is real -.-
doom eternal better
Literally unplayable. Boots to a black screen
:(
it's a little violent
"it's fine, i guess"
Not for me very repetitive walk to another big room kill all enemies go to another big room kill all enemies rinse and repeat completed story 5/10
"The game REFUSES to launch, always ends up telling me to write some god awful report but it wont even show my cursor so I have no idea where to write."
"heard about doom but never played it, so i decided to try it out. it feels just like any other fps. not any better or worse. i don't know why people are so hyped up about this."
"The first game i ever touched when i was way younger.. was doom. Doom 3 series was just a work of art with a story and jumpscares. It felt like the total package. They should have continued on that story.

But now... Doom, Doom eternal and Doom The dark ages.. they miss evrything that had doom 3.. Yes it looks cool but looking cool is not evrything. In my opinion people should not even touch all the doom games that don't look like doom 3."
"Too much parkor, sucks."
"Game wont work. It gets stuck on a 99 percent black loading screen. Tried everything suggested with nothing helping. Asked for my money back but Steam says I played over the allowed 2 hours. How could I have played over the limit if the game doesnt work? Anyway......i am not going to get into a fight with Steam over that amount of money. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THE ISSUE WITH THIS GAME AND READ THE FORUMS BEFORE SPENDING MONEY ON THIS GAME.

PS.
Thanks for nothing Steam."
Without the nostalgic aspect this game is mediocre at best
"I love the gameplay, I love all the collectables and upgrades. I do not love random doors being shut permanently behind me as I progress through a level, preventing me from backtracking to find secrets. This fucking sucks so much. I restarted a mission twice and called it quits as apparently this issue gets worse throughout the campaign. There are no mods to fix this. I really loved playing this game but this issue is SO ANNOYING. Also for a AAA game there are some issues I would never see even in indie games"
"Doom without infinite ammo is NOT fun. 
I miss the carnage I made in DOOM 1 & DOOM 2 :-((("
"So the game is pretty awesome. Fast movement kill the baddies boomer type shooter. The best part though is also the worst part with this particular version in my opinion. The music kicks all kinds of ass and the guns sound awesome...sometimes. Sound and music is such a big part of this game and my audio went from bass and punchy to making me double and triple check headphones didn't break on me. I tried multiple headsets and my laptops own internal speakers. The audio glitches were in game. And EVERY TIME it took me out of the experience.

I can recommend doom elsewhere just not on pc, for me it was way way to distracting."
to short i finished it in four hours but the online was good for a game that is not design for it and in sum missions they are way too open
I have played all versions of the original Doom and completed them at all levels. This game is so hard even on easy and the trials and Challenges are also difficult. I have not enjoyed playing this and thanks to a walk through I got as far as I am now. Although I have managed to complete the game and the bosses are hard but it is possible to do.
Got it for free and its still not worth it
Making watching the same long animation a core mechanic.
"Game no longer launches after latest 'update'. But of course I can't turn updates off. Numerous time now, an 'update' has been forced upon me, which breaks something. Whereupon i must spend countless hours searching the internet for a 'fix'. Bethesda are the worst. Will never buy another game from them."
Just not my type of game. :)
Tedious and generic
"Completely demonic.
Not for anyone under 21 years of age."
"Everyone agrees Mick Gordon is fantastic, but imma be honest - there's only so much difference one guy can make when there's an entire studio trying to make the blandest shooter the world has ever seen.

The maps are generic and about as memorable as the story, which is effectively non-existent. I couldn't get myself to care for it in the slightest; it's just a pitiful excuse at a premise so you have a reason to shoot. And honestly, this is kinda what I expected - this is what I bought this game for. I just wanted some mindless action; even as someone who had never played a DOOM game before, I knew it's not gonna be the pinnacle of storytelling, so that's totally fine. 

However, what I *did* expect is to at least get some decent gunplay in return. There's little to no feedback present in this game; both for your outgoing shots or your incoming damage. This makes this game, despite the performance being fantastic and the movement being responsive, incredibly frustrating and almost wonky to play. 

The level design is also extremely forgettable. While the maps might not be ""ugly"" per se, there's simply nothing going on and every environment just transitions into the next in a blur, leaving you with what FEELS like the same experience over and over again. Not only is there a severe lack of memorable set pieces, but the maps are also incredibly annoying to navigate. I'm all for a good challenge in video games, but if the hardest challenge is you trying to get from point A to point B, I can only blame poor design more than anything else. Not only are the environments (especially ledges) super inconsistent in what can and cannot be climbed, but every single layout is simply confusing to traverse as well. This wouldn't be a problem if this game at least had a good (mini)map, but I genuinely found myself pressing tab to peek at the map every other step.
Genuinely. DOOM might actually have the worst map I have ever seen in any video games. The 3D mode is awkward and confusing, the 2D mode is... awkward and confusing. That's honestly the only two words I need to describe it. The map icons aren't easily distinguishable or even recognizable, seeing the map's layers in 3D mode is simply annoying and reminds me of shitty late 2000s sci-fi games, and the 2D mode is lowkey unusable due to most maps having a lot of vertical overlap. Overall it just feels infuriating to even get a hang of this game in the first place as a beginner.

Also, to me pretty much all enemies feel the same, but I don't want to elaborate and put any more time into this review. I just wish there was a bit more to them than running, gunning, and *occasionally* dodging projectiles. I quit after the third mission, so maybe I missed out on the good parts that caused this game to attain an Overwhelmingly Positive rating, but I guess I won't be around to find out"
game looks great but its just another stupid boring boomer shooter no reloaaading no running we need a doom 3 remake of this engine and graphics now that wouldd be sick but this game no  its trash
"This doesnt deserve the hype it had or still has, this game is lacking with so many things.

Platforming in this game sucks and is uselessly buggy and i would say even slow:
Majority of the maps and arenas have really garbage ledges where you wont be able to grab on properly.
If you manage to climb the ledge, you will either have to slog through painfully slow relative  to the combat climb animation or have this small step up thing with no animation and it feels like you just got teleported on top of the ledge.
Oh and dont let me start on the invisible walls or actual ledges that arent meant to be grabbed yet look like perfectly grabable, or how majority of props/crates or whatever you can get stuck on.
90% of my deaths were to these garbage maps and their death holes to fall into cause of this.

The enemy behavior and spawns are not really good either:
I wouldnt mind bullet sponges, or insta killing imps but man do the spawns suck. The known ""there is always one imp loose around"" thing would be ok, if that imps death didnt trigger another ""wave"" of enemies. Way too many times i asked ""was this all? "" and ran around just to kill the last imp and get this exact same thing on repeat multiple times.

Secrets and upgrades:
I would have enjoyed this game way more if most of my gameplay wasnt playing this game with wiki up my *ss, you can say ""thats just like the original doom did it"" but that doesnt excuse how annoying it is to find. There is also whole ""you dont need to find them all"" but that will just raise the difficulty uselessly by depriving you of what you could have had making the game less fun. There are also challenges, but those are just not fun to do. Only uselessly forcing you to play specific way if you want extra upgrades.

Multiplayer: DEAD. In rare cases you find match, just ONE cheater ruins it with no effort.

Arcade: now THIS is the fun part of the game, as its basically base game but you get all the upgrades and guns relative to the level, this is how the game should have been from start. The only time i had fun was with this mode.

The amount of guns is actually fun:
I actually enjoy the different guns and their upgrades, tho i dont enjoy the whole swapping system as its either choose buggy holding Q that will dissapear on you or get cramps after playing cause i keep trying to press the buttons for the guns.

Soundtrack is REALLY GOOD... on youtube:
I dont know if im killing demons just that fast or in some weird way, but the ""music plays according to combat"" thing just doesnt seem to work for me. I keep getting random cut offs, the arenas also seem to not have enough demons for music to actually start getting good and it results in music starting its hype up section and then just cuts off. Or its just repeating few of same sounds on repeat.

Difficulty: Im unable to finish the game in Ultra nightmare due to the game buggy nature, i also dont enjoy how the game strips you of all your upgrades where you have to once again play with wiki unless you remembered the secrets, having you play with stripped down doomguy after being used to be fully upgraded to half of the game just isnt fun.
There is also the whole ""remove save on death"" thing, which would make sence if it also didnt activate on exiting. I would have enjoyed just the level restart way more than the whole game cause while i do enjoy playing this on the hardest, i dont have up to whole hour at a time to finish the level. But this is more of a personal issue than anything.

As for my bugs encountered counter:
amounts of ""ledge grab? nah"": litellary stopped counting in the tower level, the level afterwards also just sucked with this.
Enemies just not spawning: 3 times, all in the destroy coolers for VEGA arena.
Grenade throwing locking up my gun or gun wheel or vice versa where shooting guns didnt let me throw grenade: This appeared so often i didnt use grenades for first half of the game and rarely afterwards.
Clipping out of map/into something: 10, the glory kills sure are buggy with positioning.
Save corruption: 3, the game does NOT enjoy being closed mid level

Overall, majorly dissapointing for the amount of ""play it, its fun"" i got from people.

TL:DR
There is buggy platforming in my doom, yuck"
"Was having fun in game till it crashed 
and corrupted save files 5 hours down the 
Toilet from my sad life gone.

game looks aged bad as well

boring ass movement + bethesda
"Game itself is great but the Multiplayer mode is unplayable because of the numbers of cheaters and hackers in there, and neither Steam nor ID seems to care or take any action against them. There are many many complaints on Steam and all over the internet about this, and nothing seems to have been done to correct it. What kind of Software company would make a game that allows cheats and hacks in multiplayer mode? Reflects very poorly on your companies and makes me not want to purchase games from these people again."
"This is a terrible game because it is so god damned DIFFICULT!!!!!!!!! Even on the easiest setting. It takes forever to kill a monster with guns, they are too fast and agile, and outnumber you constantly. And you constantly fall off of things and die. Or you get trapped in a place you can't get out of, so you have to restart the game. I'm constantly restarting this fucking game!!!"
No one played multiplayer online this game
yeah never played it
"[h1] TL;DR: [/h1]
If You're here to mindlessly kill demons You will have a good time, the game is pretty fun, it looks and feels good (for the most part); However if You're an ""art person"" like me, (AKA you [b] care [/b] about the overall experience, besides the technical side) definitely [b] don't waste your time on this. [/b]
[h1] My Experience [/h1]
So the game is OK, controls are very responsive, graphics hold up pretty well, the story, although the way that is told is not good at all, is somewhat interesting; it just did not change Me in any way. Besides the absolute bangers by Mick Gordon (Which You can listen to in various platforms), it brings NOTHING new to the table, there's better and cheaper ways to have a good time shooting mindlessly.
And that's the good part about it, that the game is MID (at best), you know ""mediocre"" doesn't mean bad right? well it's all downhill from there, when I say the story is somewhat interesting I mean the [u] subject [/u] is interesting, the whole [spoiler] humanity now lives in mars and it has developed a way to use the energy from hell [/spoiler] main plot is OK, i'd watch a movie about that, but when I say the way that is told is not optimal I mean the game was a bit over 20Hs for me, and it is boring, a game that should be epic is boring af, the pacing is awfulI, no development at all, straight up ruins the ""interesting"" subject played it because I didn't wanna play Eternal without the backstory, now I don't know if i wanna play Eternal at all.
I mean I might give Eternal a try, but if in my first 2 hours of gameplay I see the same amount of Enemy repetition and weird difficulty bumps I will drop it. if the game would've ended on the second to last mission it would've been better.
Just to clarify, i'm not angry, i'm tired, i'm thankful the game ended so I could uninstall it, and I hate when that happens, I like to finish a game and keep thinking about its story, its characters, the things that I've just experienced, about what's to come on a sequel, or where can I find more [b] of [/b] it, or more [b] like [/b] it. but sadly this was not the case, this game's over and I'm thankful, I won't replay it anytime soon, not to say most likely never.
and usually if I wouldn't play the game all over again, why would I recommend it? there's very few games that I really like and still wouldn't play again.
[h1] To wrap things up [/h1]
[h3] Pros: [/h3]
•gameplaywise is a solid 8/10. (controls work properly, UI/UX is pretty decent, idk)
•soundtrack is on top, Mick Gordon I love you, although I'm not always in the mood for this genre 9.5/10
•graphics hold up fairly well, solid 8/10 too.
•the subject of the story is pretty cool ngl 7/10.
[h3] Cons: [/h3]
•the way the story is told and the things that happen in it are so forgetable 4/10.
•you're gonna see the same 7 enemies all throughout the game, some with some variations and depending on the zone you might see this one or this other, but it's the same enemies all over the place and past the 1st half of the game believe me it gets old 3/10 (just because the animations are pretty cool)
•the difficulty has some werid ""bumps"" it suddently gets harder, but after that one enemy it's easy again, and although I like difficult games I don't find that funny at all 2/10. (also putting the same enemies in the same order 3 times in a row on the last mission is not a challenge is artificial difficulty and it's not hard, it's boring).
[h3] Conclusion: [/h3]
5.9/10 MID
doesn't say anything to my hungry for art heart."
outdated movement and mechanics
"Don't buy any games that Marty Stratton has been part of, until he changes his ways (i.e. never). 
Mick Gordon deserved better.

Game's fine, but I find it overrated in the gameplay.
I completed it, tried doing a new game+ and got overwhelmed with tedium.

If you want a different doom experience, check out the MyHouse.wad that can be played with GZDoom."
CYBERDEMON BOSS IMPOSSIBLE AT LOWEST LEVEL
"The game unfortunately does not respond when you try to launch it and outputs a black screen. This is probably due to software factors such as drivers. I am currently using an AMD Radeon GPU with the 24.5.1 drivers installed. This isn't the first time Radeon drivers have had problems launching games, especially games from Bethesda... This game is pretty much modern and is extremely well optimized, sad to see driver issues related to modern games like this gem."
"Honestly really underwhelmed, can't continue further. Everything is a bullet sponge. You dont feel powerful at all. Hated every minute of gameplay. Menu and UI is horrid."
not hard. annoying
I dont like it
"Damage sponge bad combat = no fun, i think if i made games it is fun you cheater optimized game devs aren't fun"
"Doom 2016 is stylistically appealing, and that's where the game's charming qualities end. Glory kills are phenomenally rendered, the art direction is excellent, and the aesthetics presented are crisp. The game-play is bland and repetitive, however. The lore is drivel, the story beats are bland hero complex enabling nonsense, and the movement is atrocious. Invisible walls, shitty map triggers, uninspired boss fights and a meaningless story that banks on aesthetics and repetitive guitar riffs to invest the audience leave this a forgettable game."
"I don't know, this game isn't really for me. I heard good things etc. and the reviews speak for themselves. But honestly, it isn't for me. It's so boring. It does look nice, the kill/finisher moves are dope. But it's just running around shooting."
"no idea why this has ""overwhelmingly positive"" on steam reviews.
if this wasnt doom, but some noname game this would struggle with mixed id guess.

pros:
- music
- runs smoothly with okayish graphic

cons:
- the checkpoints
like wtf, why is there no save option. the game has ""secrets"" (more on that later) but punishes you for exploring - ""oh, youve cleared the area of all enemies and now go exploring, but fall of a ledge because the game fails to communicate which ledges are grabbable? here go back 10-15minutes and clear them again""

- damage feedback
there is none noticeable, neither when you get hit, or when you hit enemies - many fights ended with ""why am i at 20% hp? i didnt get hit at any point?!?""

- the guns + sounds
none of them stand out, you feel like shooting with an airsoft with most of them - also have fun having a different ammo pool for each one of them so dont get too accustomed to any of them.

- secrets/map design
all secrets are visible via the map - even through walls and without having spotted them before. dont go exploring, the game will punish that with the brilliant checkpoint design. if you ever see a platform/rails/whatsoever below you which look like there might be hidden something there - dont drop there - while theyre walkable they are just a deathtrap because you cant get up again (have fun reloading the checkpoint and clearing the area again ;) ) - if the game doesnt show a secret there, theres none.

- health
finishing an enemy will only drop health if you have low health - but always slightly less than you need. just annoying."

"After so many years sitting in my backlog, I've finally decided to play this game. Oh well, now I remember why I stopped. Game design is Infuriating, combat is boring and its just aint fun. I wanted to try Ethernal if that would be better but Bethesda  and their anti-customer idiocy (req. acc) made me to refund it, so I will rather go play UT or Doom classic than this."

"Down patched fallout 4 because it broke my mods and added nothing to the game
Have to downpatch Doom because a ""update"" broke mods and wont launch without them

Bethesda's mind truly is on another plane of existence"
In practice it's better as a workout soundtrack than a video game.
cannot sex the demons D:
Twice I've tried to play this game and twice I've gotten to the same spot unable to figure out where to go next. Who designed these levels? Madmen??
"I don't know if I'm weird or something but I just don't get the hype. from what I've played the gunplay feels super weak and there's no reason to use anything other than the shotgun. switching weapon mods is criminally slow, and yeah you can upgrade your suit to make all actions faster, but I don't get why they made it so damn slow in the first place. there is also legitimately ZERO damage feedback, you can get hit for like 20 damage and you can't even tell unless you look at your health bar. the game also looks like someone pissed all over the screen, and the maps are way too big and easy to get lost in cause there's no visual variety, and the map screen is somehow even more confusing... and the story is shoved down your throat for whatever reason? this is doom, why should I give a damn about the story? overall I just don't get it... I might give it another try but from what I've seen it seems very repetitive and unsatisfying"
ceeps  laging
"Just here to say that despite ""Overwhelmingly positive"" this game isn't gonna be everyone's thing.

I got 4 hours in and did not find the combat very enjoyable. 

Maybe it gets better... but I probably won't return to it."
ok
"mastery/level ""challenges"" and waiting for dialog every time I replay a level make me want to stop playing this game and go actually skin demons in real life"
"boring, running and doing the same shit."
my fucking save file is gone
"This is definitely bethesda trash. If you enjoy it, I get it. But for me I dont like spending hours looking for ""secrets"" only to need to get on youtube to find things that dont serve any purpose. The trials suck. And the thing that made me uninstall was getting to the BFG just for all the BS to get the thing. I already wasted 10 hours playing it just to jump through spit and giggle hoops... Nah this aint it for me. Cant call it COMPLETE crap but it isnt something I feel I would want to play again even though thats what this game was made for."
"Every time i try to play this, I get bored. It’s like a corny action movie from the 90s. It just knocks me out."
repetitive and not rewarding
Mediocre game.
low ammo
"Just buy Doom Eternal, this game is just for the story prior to Eternal. Gameplay is boring, especially if you have played Eternal first."
"Hey Bethesda, pay Mick Gordon."
"Audio is choppy, crackly and sped up. Modern PC, good specs, no issues in other modern games.

Unplayable."
It was too fast and action packed for my age. Make games slower already.
"ai
ai 
ai
save me save me"
great game. Cyberdemon boss fight ruins it. I was having fun too.
"ID are an amoral bunch of D Bags to say the least for the way they treated Mick Gordon over Doom Eternal and I will not purchase a single one of their games every again and guess what I am still going to play them if I want to. We can all have the same attitude as them and take what we want and give what we feel like. I also suggest to anyone who wishes to play doom;

They deserve none of your money.

By all means read up on Mick Gordon yourself but I believe we should all as consumers be doing as much as we possibly can to drive anti consumer and amoral companies into the ground by using them and giving them as little as possible."
Pay Mick Gordon
"Such a bad fucking game. I got stuck multiple times, not because I couldn't kill the enemies, but because I was literally trapped behind objects and even flew out of the map. Just play Doom Eternal its worlds better."
"overrated , maybe , i will give her a chance ."
"my grave is unspeakable I played the first 8 hours of this game perfectly normal and I really enjoyed every second of it but out of the blue the game stopped launching with me, someone please help me i had this problem for months and i literally reinstalled the whole game and it still wont work"
"A lot of good things about this game, but I cannot recommend it when there is just so much that is utterly fucking infuriating, such as when you fall to your death thinking you can climb onto a ledge that is exactly the same as all the other climbable ledges, except this one isn't and instead you can fall to your death.  Not interested in wasting my time for a game that cannot get its shit together and be consistent and functional.  Also shockingly poorly thought out keyboard layout, but at least that is able to be remapped."
now that I have fully completed the game and I still don't like it but I no longer hate it
Really bad you cant save games at all. If you get stuck on a boss you have to start the whole level over.
"Hit scanning through walls
not being able to pick up health items as they phase throw the ground?"
"literally monotone gameplay, so boring, it takes 2 of 3 parts of the game to encounter 1st big boss, classic annoying bot-killing
this game gets 5/10"
"I like this game glory kill demon, but too shame this game already cheating are everywhere and i cannot find join in multiplayer. I just need play more games, but i wasted my time for not finding this games multiplayers."
"Played for a few days, forgot about the game for a month or two, played again today, save is deleted."
"I could see how someone who is a fan of turning their brain off and shooting things for no reason for a few hours might love this game... I bought it expecting an action packed story with good game play. Instead I struggled to deal with how fast everything was, how confusing the maps were, how light and infrequent the story played a part, and how the gore kills were treated.

Specifically with the gore kills, I was at first excited that the game featured elements outside of simple run-and-gun systems, having animation tied to combat, I thought, would have amped up the ""fun"" of the gun-play. And it would have been FINE if they were used as added flavor to the game play, but considering health and ammo are tied to doing them, and there are a limited number of animations to see when doing them, it got old in literally 2 hours of play. Which sucks because this feels like a key feature.

What doesn't help is most people I talked with regarding the quality of the game either told me that the story gets good once I get well into Doom Eternity, or suggested that I turn the difficulty up more if I were bored of the experience. And if difficulty of play is the only reason to enjoy this game then it suggests only those who care about pure FPS mechanics over any and all other factors are the intended demographic. I'm sure it's fantastic for many people, but don't let the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" rating fool you if you have certain priorities for your games."
"this game cuts out all audio when i boot it up, and now i can't listen to my 10 hr long retrospective on two handed kitchen utensils while playing this dog shit game."
only worth playing if you like super mario style jumping puzzles with crappy climbing mechanics.
boring
motion sickness simulator
"art, graphics, music are great, but gameplay is super boring"
"the graphics were too good, had to play ultrakill"
"Lacks everything that made the original good. I'm not sure how you could make a game like Doom ""too gamey"", but somehow they managed it. The extremely limited ammo, bullet sponge trash enemies, and enemies that basically require a specific weapon to kill... Just, no. This isn't Doom."
meh
"it's extremely mid, doing the same thing over and over again till the end of the game! Maybe fun for the 1-2hr but later on i have to force my self playing just to finish it. 

This is the first modern game ever that i have to switch off Hardmode at 80%, not because it was too hard but simply because i just feel like it's not worth it and just want it to be done with."
my save has been corrupted? why??
"play this if you think the sequel's too fast for you
even then it's lacking in enemy variety, there are extremely few boss fights and more than a few awful platforming sections"
if this game is so good then why does everyone have like 3 hours played?
meh
"Still unsolved trophy glitches in 2024? come on...

Game is fun though :P"
Fuck Bethesda.
i have zero weapon sound
"There is so much to like about this game, however, from the moment I witnessed the mechanics of ripping open enemies for resources, it was a pass for me.

I tried and tried over the years, but just can't. Know what I mean?

Perhaps in the future, something in me will go ""ah, yeah, ok."", but for now it is an hard pass."
Too many idiotic puzzles.
"This isn't a bad game by any means, it's a really good one, graphics are amazing and it runs great for an AAA title. I'm finding it to be just... kind of boring? It's intense and all, that's cool, and I love the grenade shotgun upgrade thingy. Other than that though, I haven't been able to get very hyped about this game for some reason. I guess I like Ultrakill more. rip :("
"Doom is a great return to form, all while creating something new. But as of recent, after being purchased, Microsoft is trying to mass replacing their employees (artists, animators, designers, etc.) with AI, even as going as far as to shut down other studios all just to avoid paying a small amount of money to actual humans.
DO NOT SUPPORT MICROSOFT."
"I don't understand how this game got Overwhelmingly Positive. It feels like a joke. Each encounter is as flaccid as the next. I can count maybe 3 that were actually engaging because they had the balls to spawn more than 5 enemies. So many zones are wasted on what ends up being 2-3 enemy packs. And the cherry on top of the cake is how the game showers you with supplies so you never have any issues dealing with problems. The game does the music a disservice because the moment you think you actually get to hear the song of the stage it just turns out to be tied to the two mobs they spawned that you kill in 5 seconds. 

Flaccid."
"Imagine that you know Leonard Shelby from Memento, and he describes Doom to you after playing it. I forgot to mention that you also have a learning disability. This would be what you would create from his description. Also, the renderer choices are OpenGL or Vulkan. This game doesn't deserve a chance."
"I don't like it. It isn't fun. It has nothing to do with the classic Doom; it is just another shooter. They ramped up the graphics and the story, and that which killed the game itself. Also it is unclear what to do, where to go, which is an unnecessary change in the game. Also fights are repetitive, like ticking some boxes to fill up the time."
Too unstable.
"it plays great on linux / steam deck however I didnt enjoy it very much. The gameplay is good but the setting and story just killed it for me. I rushed through it to just so I could uninstall it. It gets repetitive very quickly.

If you're into hell as a setting and metal music then pick it up otherwise id recommend halo mcc when its on sale."
badgered by steam for a review
"First and foremost, I have spent a lot of time playing competitive shooters. I played a good bit of Doom Eternal (I have enjoyed the hell out of it [no pun intended] and am normally not one who plays a lot of singleplayer games at all tbh), beating the base campaign and 2 dlc's in nightmare mode, and at some point wanted to get my hands on Doom 2016 so I could have a real opinion on it since there is a lot of discourse. This game was on sale for 4 dollars when I bought it so I thought that it would be perfect time to get it and play through it. Honestly, I did not have that great of a time. Maybe a part of it was that I played it on the wrong difficulty without realizing somehow (hurt me plenty instead of nightmare) but even on the easier difficulty it just felt annoying and tedious to play to me. I really wanted to enjoy this game, but ultimately it did not do it for me. I respect what this game did for the franchise, and I definitely enjoyed some of the scenery and overall and visceral+darker feel of the game but it does not even come close to Eternal for me. Even with Eternal's imperfections, I believe it truly innovated on its predecessor to the point in which 2016 feels lackluster and outdated (the UI especially, it just irks me a lot and makes me feel like im playing a demo, which I know is a minor nitpick but added with everything else it leaves a bad taste in my mouth). This is not to say that there are other people who won't enjoy 2016, but I definitely think anyone who loves Eternal as much as I do will feel a sense of emptiness playing through this game's campaign. Regardless, I owe my respect to everyone who made this game as I feel I probably would have enjoyed this game much more if I had played it in 2016. I think if anything, it is a good sign I feel this way about 2016 as it means that the devs are aware of its faults and how to make improvements, so that the newest Doom game will hopefully be even better than Eternal."
Too many pentagrams images and witch stuff
The damn map is unreadable
"The gameplay may be addicting and exciting, however... there's just way too much blood and gore for me... but the game is fun I will admit. It's just I cant sleep at night after playing this game XD"
lol
"This game was fun at first. Pretty fast past action shooter. but as the game goes on, the map design becomes a game of par-cor. In which your character is not well suited for. Then once you get even further the map designs become more complex with fragmented map sections that you have to teleport between. I got fed up. Combat great, map design terrible. The maps of classic doom were far better, as far as action shooters are concerned. Highly disappointed, wouldn't recommend this game to anyone."
Wow. Game was on sale so I thought I would give it a shot. This game is absolute garbage. Bugs all the time. More puzzles then fighting. The map is a joke. They really hyped this game up back in the day. Glad I didnt waste my money
"This game is a complete piece of crap. zero stars out of x.  How can you use grenades? Nope, no answer.  Any kind of map to direct you? nope. everything about this game is absolutely garbage. GARBAGE! A complete waste of money and nothing like the original game.  Total shite."
scary demon is big and mean :(
"too much platforming, not enough doom"
Game is too badass for my crappy laptop to run :(
"its shit, overrated af"
Overrated game that isn't actually very fun. Not sure how I got memed into buying this. Having to watch the same 2 animations to heal over and over again gets real old real quick. All the guns are pea shooters and have no weight to them. Go play Serious Sam or something instead of buying this.
It's so damn repetitive 😴
worst game ever made
terrible save system
na man i miss playing team fortress 2
looks like crap try to change the settings and can't even read it enough to see to change. TRASH
"Don't buy it unless you like mazes.  You'll spend 90% of your time wondering how you're going to open a door, shut off a fire, get over to the next platform, etc.  Occasionally you fight enemies.  About as fun as losing your car keys."
the definition of mediocrity
"Didn't particularly like it. I felt like I had experienced everything the game has to offer in the first two hours. Customization of the weapon seems fun, but it just provides a ""cooler way"" of killing enemies. It's game loop doesn't suit me at all. 

Furthermore, you don't feel the ""oompf"" or ""crunch"" of the guns, they all feel weak to me. 

People hailed the music as great, but it seemed just ""okay"" and not revolutionary."
"Large Parts of the game are a f........ jump & run. Did I mention that I don't like jumping? Of cause it has no quicksave , so don't spoil the last jump. Uups! Bad luck, you spoiled the last jump! The start again...and again..and again......
Very stupid game with a stupid save system.  The best about the game is, that I bought it on a sale for 5 € or so"
"its ok. Besides the combat, it feels generic so far. Not a huge fan of this art style either. The game does get more exciting with each upgrade as they do make you feel much more powerful. Not a big fan of all the climbing and platforming and trying to figure out where to go. The game takes up a ton of space and so far not sure why. I played other games very similar that take up way less. So far a lot of it doesnt feel new but the combat fun and thats what keeping me going. Overall, I think I would only recommend this to shooter lovers. Not sure if ill finish my playthrough. There not much keeping me interested."
THIS IS A GOOD GAME BUT... for some reason the game corrupted my save files and deleted all of my progress out of nowhere
the game itself is fine but this will remain a negative review until they fix how checkpoints work (i lost so much progress towards 100% cause of the checkpoints bug)
"I really thought I would like this game. It looks so action-packed and not to mention all the good reviews.
Sadly, it was a huge disappointment! I still kept on playing, to give it a fair chance to redeem itself, but it never happened!

[b]GOOD[/b]
- Good graphics!
- Music is awesome!
- Weapons are kinda cool and can be upgraded with mods.

[b]BAD[/b]
- Boring repetitive gameplay!
- Story never captured my attention.
- Just doesn't feel right. Like it's a bit slow and sluggish.
- Weapons and hands looks huge, like something you typically see on a very low FOV on a console. Increasing the FOV doesn't change the scale.
- Weapons don't have mags, which breaks the norm. Too many times I instinctually hit the R-key to reload and instead it switches the active weapon mod.
- Map design is overcomplicated and confusing. I have to constantly take a look at the map. Finding the upgrade points for the suit and weapons are just frustrating. Feels like a puzzle!
- Map doesn't show all doors / obstacles. You think you can go some where, until you arrive in front of a locked door!
- Some areas was a little too dark and there's no flashlight that I know of."
So horribly DULL. The original DOOM is somehow still better than this.
orange screen simulator
"Decent for when it came out back in 2016 but nowadays i can't recommend this simply because eternal beats it in every single shape and form to the point where it makes this game practically irrelevant, aside from it's multiplayer component which i am almost certain no one cares as it has barely any player base after 7+ years. Bullet sponge enemies with no weak points, poorly balanced weapons, even the exploring feels tedious compare to eternal, holo grenade is a certainly a joke, and the bosses are just, laughable. Weapons and weapon mods do not switch quickly, essentially handicapping the player and slowing down the pace of combat."
For some moronic reason they decided to suddenly cap this game at 60fps. Huge L.
What a P.O.S. not enough fun to try and struggle through constant crashes and saved games lost to redundant errors. Kind of come to expect it from these scumbags at this point. BETHESDA SUCKS!
"Uhhh. Please don't brutally tear me apart like those demons guys, but I'm actually not a big fan of the game. Too slow for my tastes."
single player game that logs you out to title screen when internet dies lmao
Overrated.
"tried to play this game on and off since 2018 and kept quitting every time, one of those titles that can't grab my attention no matter how many chances i gave it"
"This is one of the best video games of all time. *Do not buy it on PC.* I have yet to make it more than halfway through the game on this platform without losing my save.

On my first save, I experienced roughly 20 crashes - often from alt tabbing or another window popping up, which just completely breaks the game in Vulkan rendering mode. It has bluescreened my PC several times from these crashes. Apparently this has been a known issue since release, at this point you can assume it will never be fixed. 

Then, four missions in while attempting to 100% clear the game, the awful built in copy-protection decided my save file was corrupt. 

On my second save, I experienced fewer crashes (switched to OpenGL rendering after troubleshooting, was more mindful to not alt-tab). Not none, but fewer. I played on Nightmare and had a blast getting through the first four missions again, plus the fifth. Completed every mission 100%, tracking down the secrets. My save is once again corrupted by the awful copy protection.

This is easily one of the top 5 action games of all time, and I still wouldn't recommend a person to play it on PC. What a waste."
"access denied. runs well on the deck tho, just badly designed"
"I've fallen through the floor repeatedly to my death and I have found myself now in a room of dead corpses; the entrance still being sealed as I've seemingly bypassed the trigger. On hardcore, this is frustrating to say the least. 

I'm glad I bought this on sale."
"This does not feel like the original Doom. The level design is boring and repetitive and dull. The game doesn't allow you to manoeuver your way. Most of the areas feel cramped with monsters and allow for the same tic-tac-toe design. If the game had some variety in their level design this game would be enjoyable, but at the current state it's just lacking in a lot of ways. 4 / 10 game"
"Fuc..king hackers, u anticheat is bullshit"
"Neutral review, I unironicaly prefer the old games."
Worked fine until I got three monitors.  Screw your lame support Bethesda - yes I have the latest drivers.
"wont be buying anything from bethesda again since the mick gordon stuff, unfortunate."
"Crashed and lost all my progress for 6+ hours
So are those checkpoints for nothing????
I was getting fun, but it's not fun to replay all of this
So it seems i should reveal the ending on youtube and just leave my post here
Dunno if I should try Doom Eternal, dont want to go through this again"
"Is this a good game? The short answer is no.
Flat storyline, couldn't connect with the main character, don't even like him. He found himself on a torture table, because of magic... Wizard did it! I guess...

Demonic presence detected. I didn't felt any demonic presence for 30 minutes of playing, no excitement, no fear, nothing... Sound is bad, commercial, no art in it.

There is a planet where there are demons, so what? Let them be there, why should I kill them? Are they threatening the earth or somebody that I care, playing the main character?

Sound of the guns are bad, boring, shotgun is better, but still muted and flat, no excitement in shooting. Maybe later is better, but if 30 minutes of playing didn't do anything good, then why waste time?

Switch to old Doom, and I would rather play it than newer. At least I see the face in the health bar, some emotions are there, so I feel that it's human, not an emotional robot that I don't know, and don't care about. No art in newer Doom, music is bad, no melody, overexaggerated beats, but no flow...

Sad times, that you have millions of dollars, and a million times the polygons, and still you cannot make a better game today. Thought that it will stay on my account, but I will have to return it. 

Waster of potential..."
The game is about clicking the demons. Who the hell was this made for? I remember Doom 3 now that was a survival(horror?) shooter. This feels like it should have been a reel shooter with a light gun.
This is the only game that's ever given me motion sickness because some retardo bombardo decided to make the FOV zoom all the way in and then immediately back out again every time you interact with something. He shall perish in the eternal flames of hell as punishment for this sin.
"It sucks the story is dumb , the characters are stupid, and i hate being locked in arena's like it was going to be some other lame arena shooter and thier like hey lets make it into a cheesy doom game. when only the original ones are any good."
"This game is a broken mess, absolute garbage. Of course it's Bethesda, so what would you expect? Being ID I'd had better expectations. Apparently there was a patch some years ago that caused a black screen on launch. And they posted a pinned comment that supposedly fixes it.

Well it doesn't. Game goes from the redundant splash screen to a goddamn black screen that you can't get out of, and stops responding. This is unacceptable, it's ridiculous, and I feel like I wasted my money on this utter piece of crap. Don't waste your money on this shit."
"Nice Alien 3 aesthetic, but the contrast sucks compared to Doom Eternal. Exploration is stressful because the game only saves after clearing a room, finding a toy, or proceeding to the next giant area. Online is almost dead sometimes and it even kicked me out of a singleplayer speedrun due to a ""sign-in change"". At least it has lots of deathmatch modes, albeit the weapons feel weak."
"I spent 90% of the time looking for the right path and 10% fighting demons. This felt more like ""I´m lost""-simulator than a shooter. Not sure if this is normall or if it´s just me."
"1. The beginning of the game is too boring. 
2. The levels in Hell are much better than the levels on Mars. Half of the game I wanted to finish the levels on Mars and get to Hell, where the locations are not monotonous, cool scenery and better gunfights.
3. There are many dead-end locations in the game that feature cliffs or walls where developers could have hidden secrets or placed armour/patrons.
4. The plot is almost non-existent.
5. Movement is slow. I would like to jump and ""fly"" around the arena, like in Quake, and smash monsters in the air.

I liked the music in this game, so I give it a 5.5/10."
No
"a game for retards. jump, shoot, run, jump, shoot, run then some moronic finishing moves etc.. etc..

don't waste ur time wth this shit."
"Really not sure if should recommend or not. Decided on ""not recommended"".

Basically so it may be found for those like me.
To say it first, this game is good. You can feel the quality and passion for the old DOOM games. The intro section of the game is cool, it looks really good, runs really good, it's difficult, fast. It has collectibles and some upgrades, but nothing that distracts from the core game.
The game is great honestly, for those that like DOOM like shooters.

The problem is that I guess I don't like them or not anymore. If you like what I guess is called now ""Boomer Shooters"" this is amazing. But if you don't, maybe give this a pass. I tried but honestly I am just not really having fun playing the game... this style of shooter is not for me."
The game itself is decent but 70GB of space for like 15 levels is too much for me.
everytime i fart a bit more of my demons escape my body
"Boring exploration, nothing like classic Doom games. You're either fighting the same enemies on a horrible gated arena or busy getting the keycard from the most obvious, glowing body in the room, rinse and repeat.

Pure male violence fantasy, far away from the clever level designs one could expect from the series."
"Movement feels floaty and there's some kind of inertia that makes you slide.  

I quit playing because of jump puzzles, fall damage, and not knowing where to go.  The floaty, sliding feel makes movement too uncomfortable to the point of being unfair."
"The game is great, but the amount of errors and crashes I had is very disappointing. Starting the game and casually losing my safe was the cherry on top."
"After many years, Bethesda can't figure out how controler support works. Eat shit."
"""id softwear""? yeah, well id rather play another game
this is just menus & unskippable cutscenes; i just want to shoot gun, not read a book & watch a movie"
"Level design was atrocious. Even though the fighting was fun, the level design is so bad I can't recommend it."
surprisingly boring. almost ubisoft level of boring. in my 70 minutes of playing it i thought i was taking crazy pills because every other people on earth swear that it's good
Wheres sex
"The game is fucking broken every time i try to do the beginning of the end  the screen glitches and Im stuck looking up from the bodem of the map,"
"THEY TURNED DOOM INTO A MELEE BRAWLER.

It can't be a shooter if it doesn't give you enough ammo to shoot. Constant interruptions to shooting. The weapons are weak, and then there is not enough ammo on top of that. I really hate this game. 

Glory kills. I hate them. They take you out of the combat and take away your control. Their only purpose is to get health replenishment and to interrupt your shooting. Health packs? That used to be something. Not anymore. It didn't constantly interrupt the game, and on top of that it gave you a reason to explore the levels to find some health. It was a useful thing to look for, just like ammo and secrets, but they took that away. They think getting health from enemies eliminated taking time to find health, but now it just takes time away control from you because it puts you in an unskippable animation over and over again. Such a bad game design that gets old immediately. Immediately it sucks having control taken from you. That is not what a Doom game is. Neither is Doom 3. This is more Doom than Doom 3 is, but the gun play in Doom is so much better than it is here. Doom is the standard. Can that even be argued? The game play in Doom was so much better than it is here. Doom had you running and gunning in the purest form, the most enjoyable shooting, but here, nope, you don't get ammo, you don't get control, you have control ripped from you constantly, you don't get to shoot unless you pay the price of constant interruptions from kill animations. Constant, and I fucking mean constantly. Yet here we are, a hundred thousand Overwhelmingly positive votes.

The level design is good with non linear exploration. That is the only saving grace. The levels are fun and would be more fun to explore if you could shoot freely like a Doom game, this being not.

Everything is orange.

I hate this game

The dialog gets cringe. The whole thing is based on you being a special little guy that can do it. It's so cringe and lame. They actually talk about you like you are the chosen one. How worthless of a story did they attempt even? The Doom games had you doomed and fighting for your existence. What's wrong with that? Can we not have Doom instead of this special little guy you play as now? An ammo-less melee combatant? What in the hell do I want to melee fight for? Get out of here. I hate this game so much."
"It just wasn't my type of game. Other people might still like tho, it just wasn't for me."
RFAR
Style over substance but don't let this dissuade you from playing Doom Eternal.
"I had a blast with this game - but only on low difficulty. 
All my previous doom games I played first on low difficulty and then on almost highest (usually one without f.e. respawning enemies).
This game on Nightmare is playable, but god it's not fun at all... The 'flow' does not exist in this diffuculty. In Doom 2 I felt extremly chalanged but also having extreme fun. 

I think part in this are not so predictable enemies, very  high self damange/barrels damage, rather low character speed when compared to enemy attacks. In Doom 2 on (I think nightmare) Imps start to shoot really fast, but you still can dodge them easly if you practice, in this game Imps are not so predictable, also their projectiles travel very fast - so when they are at range it's chalanging but predictable. From medium/low distance there is now way to predict imp movement/shooting. 

Also I hate that enemies have more health on higher difficulty - that's just teribble design... I explore a lot, but when I need 2/3 shotgun shots at imp I find myself without ammo most of times. 

All in all, I would rate this game 4/10 - very enjoyable when you don't even have to consider mechanics on easier level, but when in need of more chalanging gameplay - mechanis/design fails very short."
"very underwhelming, especially considering the popularity of the franchise. I recently played Roboquest which I thoroughly enjoyed and which I heard has kind of a DOOM-ish feel to it. So considering I had this one lying around in my backlog anyway, I figured I'd give it a go and was fairly excited to do so. But right off the bat the game just kinda felt sluggish to me. It also managed to make me grow a hate for its level design even though I only played it for about 2 hrs now. Felt boring in general + annoying backtracking.

If I had to summarize in 2 words those would be: sluggish + soulless. Maybe it just wasn't meant for me I guess *shrug*

I guess I'll keep playing a bit more until I've earned the remaining card drops"
this game is good but in the first half of the campaign its very boring and unless you're motivated to keep playing then it will put you off but i enjoyed the second half of the game very much
pretty shit man
"It just makes me so nauseous. Not sure what the problem is with this game. I have over 400 hours in DOOM Eternal and no such problems. The constant quick spinning around leaves me sick for hours... Bummer. I used to play the original DOOM from Windows 3.1, so I like the series. I have tried 3 different days and each with the same result. Am writing this review to remind myself why the hours are so low. Guess I just have to stick with Eternal..."
the blood covered naked woman tried touching me at the end :(
"unpopular opinion: I don't understand why this game is so well liked. It feels just like the original with better graphics in a awfully designed mars world that feels archaic & ugly by todays standards with no immersion..I can't stand games that make you press a button every time you pick up ammo(every few enemies),& are just linear shootem ups with god awful level design.
This game is like most modern games,its ok but gets boring & repetitive very quickly because there's no reason to care about the protagonist & therefore lil incentive to finish the game. Same problems as KF2 but at least that game had better weapons & level designs.(but it still sucked overall)

Having to press a button every time you pickup ammo without accidentally dropping your gun,completely destroys the gameplay & makes the enemies not be a nonstop horde coming at you since the game has to let you time to pick up ammo in between enemies (which sucks) this should've had way more enemies coming at you all at once with auto ammo pickups."

Doom (2016) more like Do-zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
:/
Doom 2016 has been surpassed in every way by its sequel Doom Eternal. Don't waste your time and efforts on the mechanically inferior gameplay and nonexistent story material.
I should have known given Bethesda's reputation but I decided to give them a try. The bugged achievements and crashes are game breaking enough for me to regret buying. A shame....
"Fun for a little while but overall its a bit too easy and stale, b-hopping and shotgunning a million of the same enemy becomes boring very quickly"
"replaying in 2022 id put this game in the ""allright"" section. not shit. not that great anymore. it's just that different soundtrack that got it so busted for the time it was released."
"[b]Short version:[/b] 5/10 game.   

[b]Long version:[/b] Alright so, I am an old gamer who played the original Doom when it came out, then Doom II when it came out.  LOVED those games, which really set the mark for First Person Shooters from that point.  While I played plenty of games in the decades since, I had gotten away from most FPSs by the mid 2000s.  Doom 2016 was a return to the series after 30 years.  

Doom 2016 certainly does a good job of modernising the hell demons, the UAC and adding depth and realism to the story, which was almost non-existent in the original games.  The layout and feel of the levels was good as was the linear type pacing.  

Where it lost a huge amount of the original games' charm was in execution of game play.   In the original games, I would describe them as moderately challenging - enough challenge that you need to pay attention, but not so much as to frustrate you.  The main appeal of the originals was to be this over-powered space-marine (now known as the Slayer) running through levels blasting everything that moved.  It was crazy fun to go flying through those levels, guns blazing, laying waste to demons in your wake. 

In Doom 2016, you feel a heck of a lot less powerful and capable compared to the originals.  It feels far less like you're a ""Slayer"" and more like it's a fair fight.   The weapons, to me, seemed to be about one third as powerful as they were in the original games.   Thinking I was probably remembering the originals through an inflated sense of nostalgia, I installed them again, and tried them.  Sure enough, the weapons are [i]far[/i] more powerful in the old games. 

I don't know if this was a way to try and make it more ""challenging"" for people who want that sort of thing in a game, or if there was another reason behind it.  To me, this breaks the fun of the game by making it a chore instead of a gleeful pleasure.   I play games to have [i]fun[/i], not to frustrate and challenge myself - I have real life for that.  The original games were fun, this game teeters between fun and chore.  On the easiest setting, the game is 50/50 fun/chore, and gets worse the more you notch up the difficulty.

Sure, like any game, you can get better and better at it the more you play, reducing the difficulty over time - but again, that's only enjoyable if it's fun to do.   Disappointing that after all these decades they have seemingly lost the point of the game."
cant sex the imps :(
"Some might say that the game was revolutionary in 2016 and rating it based on a 2024 experience wouldn't be fair to the game, but I am convinced that it suffers from major flaws to its design that manifest regardless of when it was made. The game's fast-paced action conflicts with a maze-like map design that encourages slow exploration. Half the time you will be looking for secrets through boring, repetitive levels rather than actually fighting, or doing annoying challenges that interrupt the action. While all this is optional, you will of course be underpowered if you don't partake. The actual fighting feels largely pointless due to the lack of an interesting story to draw you in, with a silent protagonist and the most generic villains imaginable. None of this makes it a bad game, but it does make it struggle to stand out or retain the player's interest.

This is not me just disliking shooters, because there are plenty that I absolutely love. I'm just convinced the game is massively overhyped. I can't speak for the multiplayer, but it's hard to recommend the singleplayer unless you love trying to platform in dark and repetitive areas while doing the same kill animation each time and having to juggle 6 guns because each one runs out of ammo in a few seconds."
"Skip this one. Play Doom Eternal instead.  This game suffers from horrible map design and the most frustratingly unclear quest objectives.  Platforming, which is a huge part of the game, is slippery and has massive penalties making for an incredibly frustrating experience.  

This game was a good reboot, but it is inferior to its sequel in every single way."
Overated as hell
Cant sex the Doomslayer :(
"Play Ultrakill, much better"
Too aggressive
"Don't even bother with this game, just play the classic DOOM games and don't give Bethesda any money."
boring
This game is scawy :((
"worse than doom eternal, refundig this game."
meh.
"Boring and monotonous. All you do is walk into a box, shoot all the enemies in the same way with the same guns, walk into a hallway, go into another box, and repeat. If a game is supposed to be 30 seconds of fun repeated indefinitely, this game skipped the 'repeated indefintely' part and is only fun for the first 30 seconds. Goring demons can be somewhat cathartic, but the novelty wears off very quickly."
"Horrible framerate issues, is locked to 30 fps even when i switch to vulkan, freezes when i try to play, Bethesda moment :/"
"I need easier than ""I'm Too Young To Die"" mode.  I run around... and die.  I step in the wrong place... and die.  I don't move... and die.  I take a breath... and die.  If I play a little longer I'll find more ways... to die.  Not very rewarding."
"I am just so, so, so done with games that do not respect your time enough to let you do any sort of manual save.  Just lost a solid 15 minutes of gameplay IN A DOOM GAME for being unable to figure out where to go in a level and never encountering anything that saved my game before managing to fall into lava.  Eat shit."
"Not what I was hoping for, absolutely no fun, no tension factor, enemies are simply modeled, difficulty level is high because you hardly have any health packs or ammunition, no save... poor. I'd rather stick to classic Doom and its mods, it's more fun."
"Typical generic doom with a ridiculous difficulty spike on a particular 2nd stage boss fight towards the end. Your average we couldn't get creative so we made a bullet sponge who can kill you in 2 hits fare. Trash can POS game with next to no story. I mean yeah its doom. If ya like doom, go for it. I do, but I need lube for a boss like that."
"not a sequel to doom the video game, but doom the comic book. 

the labyrinthine levels and scrolling-shooter combat of the original two games are gone, replaced with a series of boxes where Combat happens, connected via hallways. the entire combat system is designed around having a ""rip & tear"" button, a reference to a one-off Marvel promotional comic written and published four years after Doom's shareware release, with no involvement from the original creators. the end result is not ""doom, but better!,"" but ""Serious Sam with okay combat."" of course, even that only happens after you complete enough of the eight types of upgrade tree (""weapon mods,"" ""weapon mod upgrade tokens,"" ""praetor tokens,"" ""argent cores,"" ""runes,"" ""kill x of y using z"" style upgrade challenges for all of these). this sort of unlock system was always the worst part of devil may cry, god hand, god of war, etc, and this game goes even harder with it than any of them.

there is no level design here, only setdressing. secrets are not actually clever ""secrets,"" but tasks on a list you fill out to make sure you're prepared for the next level. finding most of them comes down to going down the right hallway. (often, the automap will mark them for you, so you don't even need to _try_ to find them). this is *mandatory* because secrets are one of the ways you get those upgrades: if they were actually a challenge to find, it would screw over the casual player. Doom is apparently *about* combat, now, and apparently the only way to get ""progression"" when purely focusing on combat is this type of upgrade system, so interesting level design had to go. most ""combat arenas"" are a big rectangle with some smaller rectangles in it. sometimes they have a second floor of rectangle. sometimes there are teleporters from one end of the rectangle to the other. most fights could happen in the tube from Tempest and the gameplay would not change at all. 

absolutely none of what has kept doom '93 fun, interesting, or Good At All for 30 years is in here. a travesty; and Eternal doubles down on all of it. just get the original(+quake 1) and play some fan levels instead.

played on ultraviolence."
"The navigation in this game is horrid. I constantly lost my way and wandered off into environmental dangers, it's a hellish messy maze. The navigational map is absolutely ridiculous, I don't know who designed it but I want to punch them in the face for how useless it is. They could have at least showed the outline of the level on it so that I'm not confused whether I can reach something or not, but no, it just shows this pathetic blue/gray floor and says ""off you go mate""."
you using Berserk in church????!!!! youre a menace🤣🤣
"NO BUT YES
I'm more of a fan of story based games. I looked at this game and it looked really fun. it looked like a story based game. it isn't. i think that doom could be an amazing story based game for sure. 

I do recommend this game to people who enjoy first person shooters. HOWEVER! this game does get very repetitive... it is honestly just not fun to play after about 20 mins.  i can understand why people would like this but i cant get behind it.

I want to like this game so so bad but as i said before, i prefer story based games. if someone can find me a game that has the same theme as doom but is a story game that would be very helpful!"
"From previously playing it on the playstation and from years of reviews I really expected to come back to this game and enjoy it, but I found the level design very frustrating. It's hard to enjoy a mindless shooter when you somehow can't find a keycard in 45 minutes with gamefaqs open. It's got good music! Though the company has since fucked over the musician who made it."
Terrible FPS in menus that I experienced years ago. FPS caps in certain cutscenes.. wtf. Unless its on sell I don't recommend.
"Since the very first Doom to date is no major FPS that I didn't played, and I can say this: if one don't spend six to eight hours a day, trying to master the art of killing demons, even ""I'm too young to die"" is kinda hard."
really bad stuttering issue.

"It's a shooter lacking the soul and charm of the original Doom games. Playing Doom 1 and 2 you can see how opening each door is like opening Pandoras box, you have no idea what awaits you on the other side and if you're really ready for it. You can outplay it by simply being a death machine or by exploring and secrets around the map that let you get the drop on enemies who would have otherwise gotten the drop on you. That's entirely gone from this game, you are a death machine in the lore and so you shall be a death machine in gameplay as well. Walk in a corridor, go to an arena, kill everything that breathes, walk along the next corridor, rinse and repeat. While the gameplay itself is satisfying for a while, I find that the gameplay loop is stale, but all the more power to you if you enjoy it."
"visually- 10.

Play DOOM Eternal.
Game lag every time !!!
:i
"Down-voting because Bethesda Game Studios refuse to give me access to the game. What a horrible company, I pray you never have to deal with their obnoxious and unhelpful support team."
I don't like the modern Doom remakes. Main reason is the awful glory kill mechanic. I really despise it. Yuck.
"All I wanted to do is shoot some demons in the face, but this game had me jumping and running and looking for acess cards to proceed to the next area. 
Overall I found this to be quite silly and boring. Guess I am not 16 anymore."
so overrated
"Its not bad, but just get doom eternal"
"Fuck this game.

It took a fucking HOUR to load.
Had to reboot because it got stuck at 79%

When it finally loaded it had the fucking audacity to run at 15fps.


Why does this fucking loser LUNGE when I melee.
I know what I'm trying to hit, I don't need you lunging past the thing I'm trying to punch.

Fuck this game."
"Mid. If you liked Eternal but didn't play this yet, don't bother. Slower movement, unsatisfying gunplay. On higher difficulties the monsters do massive damage but you don't have the same mobility as in Eternal to justify that.

Glory kill animations are cool though."
"Hello, review reader. This is a review of the game of the iconic DOOM franchise, DOOM 2016.

Yes, I may have played a small amount of time, but I can safely state the disadvantages I have identified in this installment of the DOOM series of games.

1. OPPONENTS THAT BLEND IN WITH THEIR SURROUNDINGS.
Demons merge with the environment, wherever you are, you will find them only when you approach at point-blank range, and that is not a fact.

2. BOREDOM. BORING COMBAT .
Mowing demons extremely boring, of interesting ways to destroy demons only close combat.

3. EXTREMELY WEAK DYNAMISM .
As if you are playing against mad grandparents from the nursing home.

4. IT'S NOT DOOM, DAMN IT. 

SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T SPONSOR THE LAZY PEOPLE AT BETHESDA."
not fun
"It is too fast-paced for me. It looks cool, but I can barely tell what is going on."
"HardLocked in Hayden's office, I presume this is the ending to the game. I can't wait to play where I left off in doom eternal"
"Beautiful graphics, many breath taking level designs.
On the other hand, all this do not compensate the monotonic game after 4-5 levels. The same pattern repeats again. Creativity seems to saturate in ""how to put even more monsters"" to subsequent scenes. If you survive a 20 monster level, hey, we closed the doors and here's another 25 for you... and you can run around like an Idi*t around in a shoot-die-repeat loop.
The intermediate challenges for acquiring skills... Retrying the same crazy run over and over just to memorize where zombies are placed otherwise time is out? By the 10th retry you mechanically execute it like a bash script... and actually, it is exactly just as exciting.  (ok, I admit, not all challenges were made equal, some are real fun)

Again: But It is really beautiful.
I'd say, 3 stars out of 5... It's too bad that choice is either recommend or not. I'd recommend trying the demo and watch some quality streams instead."
NO RECOMMEND

The game is good but the collectibles broke the flow for me.
"Kämpfen macht Spaß und geht immer vorwärts. Waffen und Rüstung upgraden ist auch sehr schön. Mir persönlich macht es aber nur sehr wenig Spaß, die bewusst verwirrend gehaltenen Karten/Missionen immer und immer wieder zu spielen, nur um alle Geheimnisse und Upgrades zu bekommen. Multiplayer gibt es wohl nicht mehr. Guter Shooter, aber nur für Leute die 1.) einen sehr guten Orientierungssinn haben und 2.) BESONDERE Freude daran haben, stundenlang in einer Mission nach allen Geheimnissen zu suchen"
"I've been playing Doom since the very first game of the series. I've loved this series.

But times have changed, and games evolve. So did the Doom series. 

First off I will say that for a 2016 game, even today..this game looks amazing. The environments are nothing short of breathtaking. And watching the movements of each glory kill or watching the enemies move around the level looks amazing.

And this is where i come in and tell you why if you only care about how a game looks then you might want to just youtube this one for free.

Doom has now taken the path of Mortal Kombat. How cool is it when you rip the monster's head off and **** down its neck? Wow! sounds really cool, huh? Just like a Mortal Kombat fatality....so cool to see the insane gore and blood fly everywhere....

...once. Not every time.

Those are the glory kills. And...they really have to go....or at least renamed to what they are: borey kills. I guess it is cool for the first 3 or 4...but then they become so boring and monotonous and disrupt the flow of the game, it is just more fun to ignore they are present. But this is where things backfire: if you don't ""borey kill"" the enemy, they can recover..and then it takes more ammo than it should to drop them.  Glory kills, plus the action together just me in feeling where I didn't even have a brain....I was just shooting and reacting when the glory kill showed up.....like I was becoming one of the zombies. It wasn't a feeling I like with any sort of game to fully turn off my brain.

But there is something this game does that annoys me to no end: it tries too hard on everything. i get it wants to be a hardcore game, but when you get a certain item from a body, the actions shows your character grab it and rip it off, like it is attached with ten gallons of krazy glue. 

Need to flip a lever? Easy, right? jsut turn it lightly to the other side? Instead...he is going to slam it through the wall. 
Need to open a door? Pull the handle? Nope.....he will just rip it off the hinges.
Need to use the elevator? Push the button right? Nah...he is going to pick up a hammer and bash the button in or set a grenade on it and blow it up. 

You may think it sounds awesome...like he is some POed steroided up soldier....but It just gets too ridiculous and actually takes away from the atmosphere. I ended up rolling my eyes more times than I wanted to. 

I guess if you are someone that wants to turn your brain off completely and be a drooling zombie, and obsessed with seeing the same gore over and over again and thinks that is cool...then this might be the game for you. Me....I'd rather go back and play when the Doom series was actually good."
"play this game before doom eternal, or else you will be disappointed"
The inability to save between checkpoints makes this game impossible to enjoy unless you have   an infinite amount of time on your hands.

"I know I'm going to hell for this (small pun intended)

I always love games featuring heavy rampage with lots of gore so I honestly cannot believe my own self that I'm left with a huge negative impression. And DOOM of all things, it's like something is wrong with me, however I cannot pretend that I had a great time playing this whether or not you loved it, sadly I could't share the same experience.

What I definitely loved about it was the engaging part, a good weapon wheel variety of weapons and satisfying glory kills. Everything else however was ruining my bloodlust mood.

The map looked a bit complex and even though there was this navigational minimap, the path towards the goal never seemed clear enough. Was I supposed to go here or there? Is that object climable? Can I really make that jump? Or good luck having to find those tiny keycards, one of the dozens of dead guys scattered around the map surely has it!

To make matters worse, the game tries to force you to collect bunch of hidden objects. I couldn't care less about that crap but without it, I'd be stripped down of upgrades to my suit and weapons, so thanks to that most of my time was spent scavenging around for unlockables. Oh and imagine my joy when I happen to find a temporary powerup AFTER I've defeated the last wave. The rune trials were good though as there was at least something I can make use of my time which is killing more enemies.

Next were the challenges, like for example perform a specific glory kill that required to you to literally crouch and aim on an ankle (That's what the walkthrough YouTubers showed me) in order to succeed and receive upgrade points. For god’s sake, that was frustrating to the point of being forced to restart checkpoints numerous times. Kill a specific creature of which I already forgotten its name and have to look up. Play a game of demon destruction of which I thought was one of the rune trials and completely screwup the level.

Another dislike I've encountered were the guns. I mentioned the weapon wheel, I've used this mechanic in other games in the past, but this one is the most irritating. While most games basically pause while selecting weapon, Doom goes in slow-motion which is okay, but the fact that it takes almost a second to load the wheel (while it instantly cycles between current and next through scrolling) makes no sense. The weapons itself also make little sense, like why do I need two shotguns for? Gunplay was also below my expectations, the noise of shooting sounds very quiet and the sound is pretty limited, almost as if they're pea shooters, the game only tries disguising that issue with visual impact animations and explosions. Compare the gunplay, mainly the sound with a classic like Unreal Tournament 1999 and you'll see what I mean.

That is why I could not enjoy this game at all. I was hoping for this to be something straightforward and simple like Serious Sam, but instead left enraged with all the tedious requirements the game wanted me to make in order for a full experience and to proceed thorough the campaign. I can see why this game is overall amazing to most people (mainly because it makes you feel like a badass) but as I've stated before, not everyone that loves a good carnage can enjoy DOOM."
Don't waste your time with a cheating game.
Game itself is quite good. But after killing final boss it always crashes- impossible to finish him. Letter E doesn't appear. Therefore it is impossible to complete the game.
dont buy doesnt work on modern gbus
"No multiplayer. Played once, collected all the dollies, and never opened it again. :(
A shame, because the game is not bad, it's just boring as single-player only. It has no replayability."
"The game is probably really good based on what I've played so far... however, whenever I open the game, all my sound cuts out. Not just the game- everything. Only one out of my several start-ups has the sound worked and I had to mess with the sound settings first. A day later and the way I fixed it before no longer works. It seems really fun, but not without any audio whatsoever. If anyone has a solution that would be great, but until then I cannot recommend this game."
screw this game it has so much issues just trying to get it running on my computer (ryzen 5 5600g and rtx 6700xt)  wont launch at all.
fix black screen on launch bugthesda.
"If you really enjoy shooters...idk if I can recommend this to you. This feels like a game I would've loved back in 2013, but ever since it came out I keep going back to try it and I just keep getting so incredibly bored with it. It just feels very generic. If you really enjoy pretty much any good single player shooters right now, this will probably be right up your alley. But for me, it's just not good enough gameplay-wise. Even though that's precisely what everyone lauds it for. It just feels too generic. 

So if you're a little skeptical, don't buy it. I was skeptical, and it turned out I wasted my money unfortunately."
"It's a little too violent for my taste. Besides that, it's pretty okay c:"
"DOOM (the original) is one of the most influential games of all time. Poured out a ton of sequels. But I personally can't get into the series. I've tried multiple times. I also can't go without saying that I respect the DOOM franchise a ton for what it has done for the FPS genre. Cool series, but just not for me."
"Hela familjen min spelar detta varje lördag klockan 19:39 efter vi käkat tacos med gurka, tomat, sallad, bröd, ost, ostsås, guacamole, salsa och lök. Min kusin och jag brukar spela detta tillsammans men det brukar typ spåra och det slutar alltid likadant.... vad är det jag gör med mitt liv? är det inte typ olagligt att ha sex med sin kusin? hhjälp mig snälla vad är mitt problem. mitt liv går ner i en spiral och jag kan inte hitta vägen upp.. har inga vänner, min familj hatar mig, min kusin har lämnat mig, dottern är död, allt går bara skit asså. snart så är det över...

+ sket bra grafaik spel med bja grafek

- den där kusin situationen"
the game is overall really fun but its getting a thumbs down due to crashing and corrupting my 15 hour save file which i can no longer access; seems this isnt a rare problem for others as well
"Keeps crashing, Foundry level made me quit this game entirely."
Too bad. Doesn't launch. Some Steam application error
Please release Wolfenstein 2009 and Wolfenstein RPG on PC! Or I'll downvote every Bethesda games!
"Just crashes all the time.. Can't play for more than 10 minutes at a time, if I am lucky.
Shame as it is a good game.  Other have the same issue."
Keeps crashing overall good but yeah...
"Bog standard, clunky, frustrating shooter. 
You get caught on random stairs.
The jumps just don't work sometimes. 
Takes forever to load, even on good hardware. 
Its atmospheric, sure, but but its also unreliable.

Wish I could refund it."
Feels more like a generic console shooter than a doom game.
"I hate to give this a negative review as it does so much right- looks great, runs great, sounds great and has great gunplay, but after 8 hours of play I decided then and there to uninstall it and will not play it again.

Why? Simple answer, the level design - it is overly complicated, convoluted and you WILL become lost/stuck not knowing how to continue and having no more enemies to shoot, then spending the next goodness knows how long wandering aimlessly about waiting to accidentally stumble across some lever or button hidden behind a container on a platform that you missed in an earlier area. Of course you can do as I did and watch a playthrough for that 'Oh right' moment and on you go again, until you get stuck/lost again. Exhausting, I just wanna shoot demons, not play a platformer!

Such a shame, loved the original Doom, but for me this is not the same. Thank goodness I got it in a sale otherwise it would have been even more frustrating than it already is. If you value your time, this game's gonna piss you off."
"The core gameplay is solid and the graphics are impressive, it runs perfectly on my (neither new nor expensive) laptop, but it gets very repetitive, in terms of both visuals and gameplay. The environments are extremely drab, boring and often cramped and the gameplay really feels like an endless loop. You get to an area/arena, which is locked down because of demonic activity, tons of demons spawn, you kill them and can proceed.

The environments do make a lot of sense, since the game is set on Mars and in hell, but I can't help but feeling that the complete lack of vegetation, normal buildings or any kind of relatable environments or objects make the game difficult to enjoy.

I'd recommend this game to 90% of FPS fans, but if you're like me and are really bothered by the problems that I mentioned, maybe this isn't for you."
"gunplay is bad, audio is muddy and does not give you satisfaction when shooting a shotgun or crushing enemies
looks like overhype"
Just Play Doom Eternal/10
"Doom 2016 honestly feels like a modern game developer watched someone play the original Doom mod Brutal Doom for about five minutes and stuffed those ideas into a modern, boring, poorly designed game.

* Story.  Please stop talking.  Please stop locking me in rooms and going on about whatever the hell this damn game is supposed to be about for way too long.  I kill demons.  I get it.  Point weapon at demon, hit fire, repeat until game done.  This is the actual story of Doom.  Original gave you some back story in the manual and then some explanations of what happened at the end of each episode in a short, funny, well-done text screen (and Doom II/Final added some mid-game intermission text screens that are just as concise and fun), but those were easily read and skipped.  This?  You have to sit through boring, worthless explanations of whatever the hell is going on in this game for forever.  Something about hell and demons and blah blah let me get back to the actual game.  What a concept.
* ""Lockdown"" rooms.  Oh no.  Just no.  Original gave me freedom to go where I wanted, when I wanted.  If a room started filling with enemies, I could run all the way back to the beginning of the level if I wanted.  It gave me time and space to fight things on my own terms, or if I felt I could handle it, rip and tear right there.  This lockdown garbage is just an excuse to make the game feel more ""dramatic"" and stuff an area with tons of poorly designed, cheap enemies to pad the play time thanks to cheap, stupid deaths.
* Upgrades.  What?  Original Doom, you had one upgrade: the backpack to carry more ammo.  Now you get weapons, abilities, and permanent health/armor upgrades just to survive the incredibly cheap enemies down the road?  How about making the game actually balanced from the start?  Or is that too much of a challenge for modern game designers?
* Cheap enemies. Filling the game with a bunch of poorly designed enemies that are, again, designed to pad the run time thanks to you continually dying to their cheap, insane attacks, is not a good way to design a damn game.  Early enemies that can basically cut your health down with one hit from their energy weapons?  Demons (""Pinkies"" -- ugh) that do an unreliable charge at you and take a billion hits from the front for... no good reason?  An insanely annoying teleporting pile of crap with a wave attack that does insane damage?  An enemy that throws poison goop at you from a mile away?  A freaking boss that has a shield on 99.9% of the time?  Come on.  Admit this was just to keep people from easily flying through the game and not an actual design decision.
* ""Glory kills"" and chainsaws and a dance of health and ammo.  In the original, health and ammo were a resource that you found, conserved, managed, and dealt with while battling the hordes from Hell.  In 2016, there's some health and ammo here and there, but they do little good if you're stuck in a lockdown room and they're several rooms back, unlike the original.  Health and ammo's primary source is instead from the stupid ""glory kills"" inspired by the hackish, silly ""Brutal Doom"" mod for the original game.  These shower you with health and a few bits of ammo while you're taking massive damage from multiple, cheap sources, making keeping up your health not a matter of conservation and resource management, but a bizarre dance of watching your health bar waltz up and down for the entire game.  Worse is the ammo, which you get embarrassingly little of from glory kills.  This instead comes from chainsaw kills, as if somehow chainsaws tap into a different repository of items stuffed inside every enemy than the repository of health and a few bits of ammo you find from punching them, which is just ridiculous all around.  But of course, we can't have the chainsaw work like it used to; it's now an instakill on lower-health enemies that does the showering of ammo upon you, but compensated by the fact that you have to refill it or it runs out of ""ammo"" (gas) after using it a few times. Come on.  Seriously?  Let me use my freaking chainsaw strategically to actually conserve ammo, not to mind-numbingly generate it every once in a while.
* Jumping.  Uuuuggggggghhhhh.  It's the end of freaking Half-Life all over again.  Platforms everywhere.  Gaps that have to be traversed.  Constantly searching for some ledge above you that isn't at all apparent until you actually look all around from multiple positions and angles.  And then it gets worse by adding a double jump, making the game into a blood-filled, violent version of Super Mario Bros.  with its insane jumps you have to make while not even having decent depth perception due to 3d graphics projected onto a 2d screen.  (And don't tell me to play the VR version.  VR is a laughable pile of garbage that needs to die, right now.)  It's ridiculous, it's bad gameplay, it's frustrating, and it's not a good mechanic.  Never has been.  Doom's protagonist doesn't jump.  He might let his mighty insane momentum propel him over small gaps, but this isn't jumping; this is falling, with style.
* Graphics.  I am amazed how many people these days cannot tolerate the original game's graphics when they are absolutely, 100% better than 2016's graphics.  ""How can you say this,"" you ask.  Because the new game's graphics are muddy, indistinct, full of distracting lighting effects, distorted to make everything on screen look nearly the same, covered in fog, and is designed to be as absolutely distracting and detrimental to the gameplay as humanly possible.  So many times I have had difficulty just figuring out what something was because the graphics were so unbelievably overdone that it all just melts into a sameness where you can't tell one thing from the other.
* ""The Doom Slayer"".  No.  No.  NO.  I cannot understand how this stupid name was thought up by the people who made this game, but it fundamentally misunderstands who the protagonist of Doom is.  He is Doomguy.  He does not slay the Doom;  he is the Doom.  He is the Doom of the demons.  The Doom of Hell.  

Go buy the Classic Doom collection on Steam.  Play it.  A lot.  It even has a modern engine for it now and the ability to play Final Doom through an add-on for Doom II.  Please understand and appreciate the precise, well-done, thoughtful design decisions for the classic games and how they put gameplay on a high, golden pedestal and never, ever betray the gameplay for some cheesy, garbage gimmick, which Doom 2016 is absolutely stuffed to the gills with.  Take a good amount of time appreciating the original and I honestly think you'll understand every single point I've made about 2016.

*NOTE: I have a previous full playthrough of this game from another platform and am also applying it to the Steam PC version which I have played enough through to verify the same issues.*"
"Doom is a good game. However, I cannot recommend the steam version. There are many bugs that make the game frustrating to play. The most common bug that I experience is the audio bug. Anytime I open the game, change menus in the menu screen, load a mission, die, load a rune trial, exit a rune trial, or exit a mission, all audio on my computer does not work. I found a small fix to this. If I disconnect and reconnect my headphones on bluetooth, it gets audio back. I have all my drivers updated and this only happens with this game. This was tolerable for the first few missions, but after about 10 hours of gameplay, it has become very frustrating to do this everytime I die or load a mission or open the game. Another bug is one where I cannot fire or switch guns after I throw a grenade. I found a fix to this online where you press shift+tab + esc x2. However my fix: don't throw grenades. It's a simple fix but still annoying and makes the game feel unpolished. Another bug I encounter is sometimes when I upgrade my doom suit with praetor tokens, the game stops working and shows a bunch of code on the screen that I don't understand and so I have to close the game and lose my progress for that section. It is very frustrating especially after I just did a rune trial I had trouble with and then it crashed after I tried to upgrade my suit and I reopened the game and the rune trial was marked uncomplete. I do not encounter many bugs on all my other games, and this only happens on the steam version. This is a good game, but with the amount of times I encounter a frustrating or game breaking bug per session (like 5) I can't recommend this to other people."
Errorrr on my roh ally
Crashes every hour or so and got my 7 hour game save corrupted by one of these crashes. The game needs fixed but at this point I doubt they will fix a 9 year old game
"It's a primitive peace of repetitive trash with low quality content.
The whole gameplay is just walking from one room to another and killing same enemies until they stop respawning in that room."
"Meh There's so much playtime inflation on the beginning, I already know I wont enjoy this."
Multiplayer sucks. Weapons that have 2 seconds delay on firing and enemies with over 200hp everytime. Also no anti-cheat and team-balancing.
Shorter from the old good game plus has terrible map system
takes forever to load zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Garbage
"Honestly, it's extremely repetitive. Glory kills seem awesome until you see the same animation 100 times. The game wasn't too difficult either. Sure I only played it on ""Hurt me plenty"" but I shouldn't have to put the game on the hardest difficulty where it artificially makes it harder by increasing numbers to just to make it more challenging."
"Not recommended. Great graphics and gameplay, BUT id Software has a profound disrespect for the available free time of its gamers. The game is ludicrously difficult, even on easy settings. I gave up and played it on God settings in dev mode after losing far too many times in row. It also becomes the equivalent of Super Mario Bros with a shotgun for much of the game, jumping around from one platform to the next, and falling to your death more often than not. This is supposed to be Doom, not parkour!!!! The majority of your time playing Doom will be spent running around incessantly lost, simply trying to figure out how to get to the next checkpoint and level, then getting killed, and starting over at a checkpoint again. The developers put almost no hints or obvious clues that would help gamers move along quickly throughout the game, so you spend nearly all of your time lost in space, retracing your old steps to find something that must have been missed previously. Even online walkthroughs aren't very helpful, because all the levels are a confusing mess that look nearly identical everywhere you go. Doom has always been a great franchise through the years, but they really dropped the ball on this one unfortunately. If you value your free time, and are a casual stress-free gamer, avoid this one completely...."
Toggle crouch? Baby game.
satanic images
it fails to load 60% of the time
"this game is afwul, how it got overwhelmingly positive reviews is beyond me. people who like patrick bateman sigma grindset 100 ohio will love this game though. chuds."
It was fun for about the first 6 hours. Then it became the most self indulgent wash rinse and repeat shooter game I have ever played. its like they just ran out of ideas half way through.  Super glad I got this on sale for $5
was too hard whilst playing and it hurt alot while was tearing through demons :(
"Buggy as hell.....played like 15 hours in a new slot and then the ""file was corrupt"" and I had to delete.... I was just trying to go back and remember some old times....guess not junior!!! POS!!!!!!"
don't buy this unless you want to lose your progress every single time the game crashes...
"If you want to play a doom game, go for eternal. It's a lot more enjoyable. This one felt a bit more sluggish, no dash in this one. The environment is also way cooler in eternal and the loot design is more loyal to OG doom."
"Honestly, this game is a major disappointment. The level design is very lack luster and boring. Platforming is fluid and cool at times, but it doesn't really fit the classic Doom level design. Classic Doom and Doom II have a far more gritty atmosphere. In this game the colors feel way too over saturated. The guns in Doom 2016 feel way worse than even the classic games, almost like I'm playing Halo (no recoil or feeling of power behind firing the gun). I played on the hardest unlocked difficulty, Ultra-Violence, and it felt like I was playing the game on recruit difficulty. The Ai enemies are way too easy to kill. Maybe on Nightmare difficulty things would be a bit more challenging, but the base difficulties are just too ez. Just shoot an enemy until they glow, and perform an insta-kill on them. Rinse and repeat. Honestly, just pick up Classic Doom and Doom 2 and install the brutality mod for those. It is a wayyyy better experience. Guns sound and feel better, and the level design is great. Plus the modding community is amazing. Less $$$ as well. I really wish I could like this game, but it just falls short in comparison to the classic games with the brutality mods installed."
"Pretty fun game ,however 
You can't save the game whenever you want"
"Spent several hours trying to get this game to work properly but couldn't get it to work on my pc (which runs several more recent / more demanding games).  Appreciate this may be just my set up but thought I'd share in case others have the same issue.  And then couldn't get a refund as I'd spent too long trying to get the game to work, despite never actually being able to get to anywhere apart from the load screen!"
"I love the combat and gun play, fantastic, top notch. The levels and enemy design are visually interesting. It's great to see enemies from my childhood realized in today's modern graphics. Unfortunately the story is not interesting, it just serves to string levels together and I found it impossible to get invested in anything going on. Also Doomguy is frustratingly slow, so zooming around the fight arenas the way I want is not possible. The game requires you to complete finisher moves to gather health and ammo, which is fun, however you are vulnerable to attack while the Doomguy slowly goes through the finisher animation.

The music is excellent, battling enemies while jamming to the sound track never gets old. I love the difficulty, but the game's checkpoint system is abysmal. You just spent an hour refining your skills to complete a Gore Nest  or Rune challenge on Nightmare, you finally win, you are thrilled, and then you die for whatever reason and the game resets you back so far you have to do the entire fight again. There was no reason to remove manual saves from this series, and I can't respect a game that doesn't respect my time and effort. Ultimately, I had a great time fighting through this game but would only recommend on discount."
Why are you looking for negative reviews for this game? Go download it now.
died at least 7 trillion times to double jump failing. not recommended.
"This game is incredibly unstable, and is in need of some support from the devs. I think the game crashed a minimum of 10 times in a mere 78 minutes of playtime. Steam says 83 minutes because the last crash it took five minutes for steam to finally close the game!
Latest drivers for everything, nothing helped this dumpster fire. Refunding right after this. Doesn't matter if it was cheap during Steam summer sale, it still needs to work as intended."
"Should be called ""black screen simulator""."
"Is there anything so wrong with this game? Not really, but I thumb-downed it, because after a few hours of playing, I lost interest.

Edit for second attempt: Yeah, I was right the first time. Kind of gets boring after a while, but it IS some mindless fun."
meh
"This game honestly felt lackluster, yes it has badass battle scenes but i guess its just my itch of movement shooters not being scratched since the movement is a slow and airstrafing even with the rune is not that much of a difference. The story was mid honestly, though i doubt people actually care about the story. Plus the game became like a chore when the enemies got harder, dont get me wrong i love a hard battle, but the shots i shot didnt feel like they were satisfying. For example in a souls game however gave you the feeling of actually hitting something. Overall this game did not met my expectations. Lets hope doom eternal can change my opinion on this game."
I don't understand why people like the gore. this is awful
Boring and Repetitive
"First off the positives. The soundtrack is awesome, the graphics are very nice and the game runs like butter on a lot of hardware. I'm pulling 200+ FPS on ultra 1440p. The action is quick and you have plenty of ammo recharges to basically just unload. Everything on paper sounds good.

I'm not sure what my exact issue is with the game, but it feels far too fluid. No action has any resistance. What I mean by that is a shot from your shotgun or pistol feels the same. Punching and ripping an enemy in half offers no slow down and you just unload on the demons and fly through levels. It just has a weird flow and feel to me. It's hard to put it into words, it just feels like you're gliding through water. I don't dislike the game, but it just doesn't hit in the same way another FPS might."
"I just can't get into it. It either annoys me, bores me, or I get lost and can't figure out where to go."
"Great game, but bugged challenge achievement prevents 100%"
"idk it just feels so sluggish and tedious. if you're going to make an FPS with an emphasis on constant movement, why make the player so slow? why lock the jump trajectory and not even deign to give us airstrafing? why lock the rune that gives you mobility in mid-air to about a third of the way through the game?

i know the difficulty curve in this game is kinda infamous at this point but the fact it locks your difficulty option in for the playthrough means you can't even do much about it. getting your ass kicked at the start because you only have two weapons and no mobility options, and you DARED to pick nightmare? lmao skill issue. think the game got way too easy by the end and you started out on hurt me plenty? have fun with the literal cakewalk you now have. at least in retro doom UV was basically hurt me plenty with a few more guys

glory kills are great but something about them feels off in this game, at least compared to eternal

actually, i think a lot of these issues came about after i played through eternal and realized how much it made this obsolete in comparison"
lame AHH game.
"incredibly overrated, when the movement game has dogshit movement (you cant strafe mid air)"
"Can,t see anything its to dark, ridiculous"
The guns feel weak and doomguy is way too slow
"Okay but severely overrated.  Seems to hang onto the need to ""feel like Doom"" so much that it limits itself as much as it succeeds.  Get it on sale if you want a whole bunch of repetitive rip-and-tear for $5 or so.


The Good:
Combat is fast, violent, and over the top, as it should be.  Weapons are decently fun at worst and higher tier ones are extremely satisfying (weapon attachments expand this even more), and the game does a great job of making you switch between nearly all of them in later fights (at least on Ultra Violence).

Glory kills and the chainsaw are great mechanics to keep health/armor/ammo from drying up without spoonfeeding the player.  They might be the best thing about Doom. 


The Bad:
Design/environments lack variety.  I was happy to see the outside of an ice-covered base at one point, but was quickly sent inside to wander through *even more* dull chrome hallways filled with gore.  I hope you like gray and orange.

Combat gets samey really fast and never recovers.  Every big room spawns a bunch of enemies, and it's typically the same general variety of them (except with more waves and increasing numbers of the harder demons as the game goes on).  It's a shame that combat this fundamentally good can become boring, but it somehow manages to.

There are only three boss fights, and all of them take place in flat, featureless arenas.  Like every other enemy, the trick to fighting them is to dodge projectiles and shoot them a whole bunch until they're dead.  Fine, I guess, but felt like a wasted opportunity to do something more.

Exploration/secret-finding, despite being a pillar of the game, is slow and uninteresting, and often involves just wandering around until you find an open vent or a big out-of-place lever on the ground.  Coupled with the frenetic combat, it makes the game's pace feel horrible - a constant lurch back and forth between violence and tedium.

Worse, some secrets (shown nearby on the map, with in-game upgrades) can't be collected until you complete more of the level - except that some levels prevent backtracking (doors lock behind you, etc.), so if you make a bad guess that progressing the level will give you access to the secret, you have no choice but to restart if you want to get everything.

The plot is unoriginal.  Big soulless corp exploits dangerous thing for power/profit.  Stuff goes wrong!  Ending is short and mYsTerIoUs in a way that just felt lazy.  Looking back, it's sad to say that the first 1-2 minutes of the game are probably the most interesting part."
"Unskippable cutscene, no manual save, big ass confusing map, unbalance Ultra-Violence difficulty. I mean, previous Ultra-Violence Doom games is hard and challenging but still playable, not this one. This one is just pain in the ass. Doom 3 is way better."
Games too fuckin' big.
can't cap fps and so runs ... too well? it's seemingly breaking the game I'm not sure what I have to do to make it playable.           Will gladly recommend if i can find fix.
doom eternal is better
"Retarded game with stupid checkpoints, bugs, monsters spawn inside you, no dmg feedback, retarded weapon system that force you to use your keyboard like piano"
"An over-saturated mess.

This just seemed like one multiplayer arena after another linked together by some tunnels and elevators with some uninteresting tale weaved throughout it all. Long gone are the days of action/adventure, problem solving I guess. After about half way though this, I couldn't wait for it to be over. How far Doom has fallen from the original recipe."
I didn't like the pistol (i like games based how much i like the pistol)
"for the $5 i spent, fun but unremarkable. fps's that do the same thing as a thousand other fps's shouldn't get the 9.5's out of ten this game got all over the place. those ratings should be reserved for games that innovate in a significant way. games that feel different and new and leave a lasting memory deserve 9.5. this game doesn't do that. nothing specifically wrong with this game. doom is what it is, but that warrants an 8.0, not a 9.5. so a down-thumb from me to counteract the rating inflation. (if you haven't noticed i have a chip on my shoulder about the lack of innovation in the fps genre especially after seeing the few games that tried to innovate and had enormous success... e.g. bioshock, dishonored, alien: isolation)."
"Very repetitive even at 1 hour. Glory kills? Meh. Monsters keep sound 'whaaah' in your headphones, its annoying at best. 

Gameplay is standard FPS, run and gun. You don't even need to aim bro, there is a shotgun with plenty of ammo. Infinite ammo on your pistol.

No strategy required - run and gun. Did I mention the 'whaahhh' sounds in your headphone. Story? Meh. Innovative gameplay maybe? Ofcourse not. 

I would have refunded this if I was eligible."
"So the game is good. I just wish it didn't become impossible to play. Like I got to the 11th level boss of 13 levels. And that is ridiculous.... I played on the easiest setting. I always do. I don't care. I paid for the games I just want to have some fun and move on. Not redo a level over and over. Anyway at that point the game becomes not fun to play. If they just made easy beatable (Like most other games). It would be fine.

So then I did God Mode to beat the boss and it flags your save file. So you don't get achievements or anything. It's not even fun at the point you start using cheats anyway. But even on God Mode the boss is annoying to beat. It just wasn't fun anymore. So never played level 12 and 13. For that is why I can't give it 5 stars. It's like 3 to me. I wouldn't even recommend it. It's not playable for me."
In 4 hours i softlocked my game 3 times
"As someone who isn't a fan of shooters, this game serves as a reminder of why I steer clear of the genre. I don't mind brutal violence and killing daemons with a chainsaw (though that was surprisingly fun for the first few times). However, the dullness and monotony reached unparalleled levels, leaving me questioning my life choices and longing for a more exciting experience, like organizing my sock drawer."
"So much hype around this game, I expected Doom and it had some cool stuff every now and then, but fights are crap, most guns don't feel powerful, I see myself killing too many enemies in melee, and more than half the time is spent looking for those USBs to gain upgrades.

I hope Eternal is better."
"One of the most overhyped games of all time. Combat is dull and clunky, the games story is uninteresting and it's very buggy. No clue if i missed some joke or something but i just don't like it."
"I was going to replay this game, but then I remembered how bad it was."
There is no option for hold crouch its toggle crouch only
"Decent game. Good music. A little disappointing though. Maybe I'm a little late to hop on the hype train, but it felt really short, and playing this after playing ULTRAKILL makes this game feel slow, dry, and with a shallow combat. Not worth the 20$, but I'd still recommend if on sale."
"The campaign takes you from interiors where everything has gone to hell, to the hellish landscapes of mars, to hell. Its just red all the time. The levels are largely the same. Halfway through you've seen all the enemy's, and the gameplay consists of rip n tear your way down a hallway or rip n tear until a room is empty. There's no variation. No we're in this kind of place so there's going to be a particular enemy you'll see a lot of. No the landscape here is different so there's all these different obstacles and opportunities. An encounter could be transplanted from a shrine on hell to a science lab and you wouldn't know the difference.

Its a competent game, well balanced, good soundtrack, pretty graphics, barely any glitches that I found, but it's so repetitive like that one guy that just talks about how wasted he got last night."
this game sucks
"I guess I'm in the minority on this one, but I hated this game. I beat it, and it was the video game equivalent of being forced to eat a bowl of canned green beans. I love classic Doom, but - to steal a joke from someone - this is like one of those Taco Bells they renovate and make to look like a bank. 

- Most of the levels are corridors filled with the weaker mobs that you can just headshot with a pistol. Possibly the only good use of the pistol for the rest of the game. 
- The corridors inevitably lead to an arena-style area that you clear out the riff raff and then begin by pressing E on some object. These arenas are just basically the entirety of the rest of the game. They are chaotic and you are just running around double jumping and shooting while everything dogpiles on you. 
- Armor is like PAPER thin. Just like a few hits and it's GONE. Kind of seems worthless at a certain point. 
- A core mechanic is pressing F on flashing enemies when they get close to death. This starts a melee animation that results in them dropping a pittance of health and/or ammo. So you're in this chaotic battle intermittently watching these dumb melee animations - which by the way the other mobs can move around freely while you're in the animations - and you are dumped back in control afterwards and sometimes it's in a disadvantageous position. 
- I frequently lost entire battles to a single remaining shield guy. Like seriously, Hell should just invest in more shield guys, that could have won them the whole ass game. 
- The other only problematic mob is the charging bull style creatures that will just annihilate your armor if they hit you. 
- I couldn't really understand the main NPC that provides story cues. Like they went with the deep voice thing and I was just like ""huh?"" most of the time. 
- The whole game is too dark. Not like thematically dark, I understand it's hell etc. but like literally I couldn't see mobs or just was confused jumping around the arenas sometimes. 
- I don't think DOOM is supposed to feel like Unreal Tournament? Like the old school ones you couldn't even jump and 3 was like survival horror. 
- The sets were not really memorable. I think something that made the original DOOM games was the sets and they just didn't put much originality into this. 
- I think a lot of people love the music and like don't get me wrong I like rock/metal but this is laughably repetitive and generic. 

If you get this game on sale for like $3 it's probably ""worth"" it, but I hated playing this and I couldn't recommend or leave a positive review."
multiplayer achievements
"boring, TWO  THUMBS DOWN!"
"By all rights Doom is a great game. It looks good, sounds good, and the gunplay feels good. So why am I not recommending it...?

Because you will spend more than twice as long backtracking over the empty map, than you will actually fighting anything in it.

The gameplay is fun and frenetic bullrushing, BUT if you want to level your character, you have to explore the maps with the fine comb for the collectables. No, not for achievements sake - I mean literally your character level (and power) is tied to finding upgrades hidden in vents or up cliffs. If you don't want to feel yourself getting weaker as your progress, then you're committed to doubling back and searching every cranny of the map. Or looking up a guide for the map.

BONUS: sometimes during a mission, you can't backtrack to one. Maybe a drop, or a door that locks behind you. Do you feel like playing the entire mission all over from the beginning for that single upgrade? I sure as hell do not.

A fantastic gameplay design otherwise, but I'm not going to play a game that can't make up its mind how it wants to be played."
boring
Game gets very repetitive after a few hours
"I owned this product and now i do not. I do not understand. I do not like this. 

For why did my program get taken away?"
"PLEASE DOOM DONT MAKE STUPID PUZZLES ALSO THIS GAME IS NOT EVER SCARY BRUH I THOUGHT IT'S SAME AS DYING LIGHT BUT NOO IT GAME LOOKS LIKE MADE FOR +2 yo

I guess all doom series are same as this :/ not a fan of doom"
too expensive but gameplay is kinda good
mid game
lack at gameplay its boring than eternal
"Decided to go back and complete all runes, get all upgrades etc. I decided to restart the final mission - big mistake as all missions I'd replayed at been lost so all runes, weapon upgrades, upgraded runes, the lot gone. Nothing to warn you other than says current mission progress will be lost (of course I wrongly thought this just meant THAT SPECIFIC mission not every rune, secret etc I'd gone back and completed.). I was just about to finally finish the game, now I've just uninstalled it as I've no intention of going back and completing all that again. 

On googling realised that I'm not the only one and there is nothing you can do to get your old game file back."
"DISCLAIMER: 
[i] DOOM [/i] is a good game. If you are interested in this game, I'd give you a 97% chance that you'll like it. Why? just look at any of the tens of thousands of positive reviews. That said, [i] DOOM [/i] does a few things that make the game impossible to enjoy for me, no matter how solid the game is at its core. If you play games like me, if your brain is Autism-addled like mine and ''optional'' challenges and secrets feel as though they are mandatory, then read this review.

First, let's establish what kind of game [i] DOOM [/i] is. As the store page describes: ''fast, fluid movement provide the foundation for intense, first-person combat.'' Indeed, this game is best enjoyed running around like a maniac, crushing demon skulls, shooting their heads off, and blowing them up. The game's intended experience - what it's crafted around - is to slay demon after demon while you're propelled forward by a killer soundtrack. 

Given this core of frantic action, a problem arises when the game introduces challenges and secrets with every level. Let's start with secrets. These consist of hidden areas that contain either collectibles (not relevant for in-game progress) or meta-upgrade points that allow you to improve various capabilities of your character for the rest of the game. (for example faster animations or more equipment capacity) At the end of each stage, you'll get an overview that indicates what you did and did not find. Without fail, seeing this screen was a stab; a painful reminder of all the stuff I missed. How much stronger I could be, but was not. For the levels that I did, I found about 20% of the useful stuff each time. This left me with two choices: Either I spend 30 minutes after clearing a level scouring the map for its hidden secrets (or, alternatively, use a video guide to find everything), or I attempt to suck it up and tread on, missing many upgrade points in the process. Given what I explained before about this game being a fast-paced adrenaline ride, I hope you can see that the first option is completely antithetical to the game's intended experience. It's just not fun. It's tedious and takes the pace completely out of it. For this reason, I attempted the second option and tried to treat this stuff as optional. This proved to be impossible for me. My brain simply can't handle leaving so much stuff behind while constantly being reminded of it at the end of each level. When I found out at the end of a level that the game even hides the upgrades for improving your core attributes (max health, max armor, max ammo) after missing it, I gave up.

Each level also comes with three combat challenges. These reward you with points for upgrading your weapons. Soon enough the game starts rewarding these to you just for killing demons in each level, so for the sake of your progression these are not so terrible. Unless, that is, you are like me and at the start of each level you decide to check what your challenges are and feel a compulsion to complete them as soon as possible for fear you might miss out if you complete the level before being done with them. What makes these challenges especially terrible is that in trying to achieve them, they change the way you play often in a way that is, again, opposed to the fun way of playing the game. Let me explain by giving a typical example. The first challenge you'll get is to kill two enemies with one shot using the shotgun. Now, If you are like me, you'll painstakingly try to whittle down the enemies' health to the point where they'd die if you so much as point at them. Next, you'll try tediously to group them together so that you can try to finish off two in one shot. After trying a while, you'll succeed. Congratulations! you completed a challenge, there will be thousands more to come. The price you pay for going after these challenges is your enjoyment. Doing them dictates that you play in a way that is not fun, and not doing them (if you're like me) will eat away at you in the back of your mind while you desperately try to push it away.

If you identify with my way of playing games, you should strongly consider against buying [i] DOOM [/i]"
Literally my reaction to that information (I have severe anger issues and homicidal tendencies)
"It has all of the elements of one of the best first person shooters of all time, but it also has some of the most annoying traversals between waypoints I've ever seen. I got lost, tried to use the map, which didn't help because it doesn't tell you where you're supposed to go. I booted it up again today to get the trading cards out of it, and spent twenty minutes just blindly following the waypoint marker, and then getting into fights in tight corridors with bad lighting so I wound up hanging back and picking enemies off one by one, which is exactly the opposite of the game's intended play style.

If it was a bunch of arenas all right next to each other with the occasional secret and platforming challenge, 10/10. Game as exists is more getting lost and squinting at objective markers than actually killing demons, and I'm not even satisfied with the demon fights when I get to them."
"Save the game. Then see ""File is corrupted"" in the game save slot. Great. Start the whole fuck'in game all over again? Crappily made game. They get no more of my money."
"It's boring, I'm bored, I want to progress with fluidity instead of kill all, door doesn't open, go find last enemy, repeat."
Boring ass gameplay
^^ cmon another greedy price hike....
I jus don't be liking it ykwim
"The most boring FPS I have ever experienced. You just kill demons. ""ThAt's JusT wHaT dOoM iS"" No it's not. The first 2 DOOM games as well as 64 had really interesting and inventive level design, puzzles, varies enemy types, and tight gameplay. DOOM 2016 has been nothing but killing the same demons over and over again in nearly exactly the same level layouts."
It's just an inferior Doom Eternal. I tried playing it on Nightmare and I couldn't. I rather prefer to waste my precious GBs on DE than this.
"This game is good, but outdated. Just buy Doom Eternal, it's better in every way"
"i do not recommend this game , because this game doesn't work! 
I bought this to play over the holidays,  (for the mouse and keyboard experience), and all i get is a BLACK SCREEN  when i launch it. 
i don't understand how a PC game works well on my PS4 but doesn't on my pc
Also i looked for a fix ( which no one is suppose to do in the first place) , NOTHING WORKS."
"Game breaking bug at the Close The Well mission that STILL isn't fixed after 7 years. After killing all the demons and destroying all 4 coolers, the way out won't open like it's supposed to and the music keeps playing. This prevents any further progression in the campaign. I tried the workaround where you glitch past the red wall but I couldn't replicate it. Way to ruin a fun playthrough, id.

There's a whole thread about this issue here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/379720/discussions/0/357287304433131370/?ctp=5"
I can't find the exit
"The multiplayer is a f#cking joke, never have enough people to start a single session."
boring game made for low iq drooling bethesda fans.
"Was ok at best. Not really sure about all the hype that was about it. 
Most weapon really have not impact. just shoot till flash, you can then hit ""F"" key and over kill cut scene,"
"no mod support
every day we stray further from DOOM"
mah pc is poopy
weapon wheel doesnt work
"Kinda meh,. really slow didnt want to get through the game cus of how i was give almost nothing and had weapons that did jack all compared to other fps shooters. Also its alot slower than i was initially told."
"Just no.  Absolutely not.  The epitome of dreadful game design

A boring and dreadfully repetitive slogfest where I was playing solely for the sake of completion by 3hrs in.  The monotony is only punctuated by bosses, bosses that are even less fun than the core game-loop.  

Do not even consider buying it - it is worth neither your time nor your money.  Who decided to shower this tripe with awards?"
"It's too slow-paced. I have too much ammo, too many resources to kill demons with, and the spaces are open enough that I can take my time.What do you mean change my difficulty to a higher setting? No."
战斗30秒，找路半小时，游戏节奏像是便秘了十年
"No sound in-game, and I've tried every 'fix' available. At least I only paid a few dollars for it."
"Ya know, I really don't care for this game.

I absolutely loved pre-doom 3 content and this seemed to be trying to make a modern return to form but the formula doesn't work.  Sure, its aesthetically well made.  But the gameplay is stiff and much slower than the original.  The AI is about as intelligent as the original game was 30 years ago but without the well crafted design of that era's weapon kit.  The map flow and interplay is generic and forgettable.  Perhaps worst of all is the way you're *supposed* to play is with constant pauses while you wait for your supposed glory kill to finish.

TLDR: Don't believe the hype."
Apparently this can run on everything except my PC
"This game really isnt worth all the atention, all i can say that its just a run and shoot type game, in the first levels there are only 2-4demon types and they arent even strong. The games story telling is really bad, i dont even know if it really has a story, all the characters say like 10 words per level and the rest is searching for the next level since the game doesnt clearly tell where to go next.

2/10 only buy it if you enjoy shooting without any story and cool stuff"
"I cannot address this review to main game, which is sold here. On my first playthrough, I intentionally installed a mod to increase damage and ammo of all weapons in game, disabling boring GloryKills and other elements of looter shooters. From myself I can only advise to buy the game with at least 50% discount and install Doom (2016) Weapons Mod v.1.2 by Rivarez on it. But it will lose opportunity to get any game achievements, as for its correct work modification activated developer mode. Keep in mind!

As for the game with the previously mentioned mod, Doom feels quite correct, mediocrely thought-out, but no less interesting. Lack of ubiquitous drops of ammo and health kits force player to remember where the necessary resources took the place and in what quantity. This is much closer in spirit to the original Doom II, in which, because of the large number of enemies in locations, it was necessary to actively fight and be wise in choosing weapons, tactics, know where and how much health and ammunition can be replenished. Visually, the game resembles its predecessor - Doom 3. Overall this is last game from id Software, for which I, as a fan of classic shooters, am not ashamed. Don't forget that all of above applies to Doom 2016 with installed Doom (2016) Weapons Mod v.1.2 by Rivarez, which you can download from link below:

https://www.moddb.com/mods/weapons-mod-for-doom-2016

If you're not sure you're ready for this game, you can easily download a stripped-down first level of game as a demo version, should help you decide on choice. In terms of performance and the game's friendliness to low end systems, the demo ran on my average laptop with a graphics card equivalent to a GTX 550ti in performance with mobile processor Core i5-6300U."
Misleading minimum requirements
Unplayable. >20 minute load times.
"actual garbage game, i would throw this in the trash if i had a physical copy"
mechanics so dated feels like 1993 doom
"Movement too slow. Enemies too basic. Combat flow constantly interrupted by the glory kill system. Mandatory combat-less exploration between level sections kills any momentum you might have gained, with further exploration being heavily encouraged in order to get collectibles for a tacked-on upgrade system. Both the music and graphics are better than the actual gameplay, and these fail to carry the game. Even a mod (Black Doom), while somewhat redeeming the slow movement, failed to jazz up the game's barebones formula sufficiently for my tastes. It may advertise itself as a boomer shooter, but it's really just a lame FPS."
"Good from a technical point of view but everything else is bad. The AI of the game is not exploited to its potential. Gameplay dumbed down to cater to kids at lower and medium difficulties and at higher difficulties it come close to fighting high level bots. Poised with scripts. They added secondary fire modes and upgrades which is not Doom. Might be enjoyed by people who love the MP, but overall not a good single player experience."
More repetetive than a clock
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! It doesn't save your game, every time I play it, it just says that it's corrupted or lost, so don't buy it, share this with others."
extremely average
"Something about this game.  I only played it for 10 minutes and I absolutely hate it.  It is so boring and uninteresting.  I enjoyed the original Doom and Doom 2.  This game is just so underwhelming.  The enemies take longer to kill than they should.  And there's just so much orange, it's ugly."
go play doom eternal
"I didn't like the level design, the shooting mechanics felt off and I really don't care for repetitive glory kills. Maybe I'm just tired of shooters after 25-odd years of playing them but I finished Titanfall 2 around the same time and enjoyed it."
meh i did enjoy more wolfenstein than this one finished once and not playing this again
too much fucking platforming

hot garbage. video settings are screwy.
"Painfully slow movement.
No aim-down-sights."
Crashes quite a bit.
"Gaming 2 hours, in maze 1 hour."
Shame the game (mp) is full of idiot cheaters. Suppose that's what you get with no anti cheat. Shame as the mp can be a blast until a moron shows up.
na
i really don't like the balancing of damage in certain parts of the round where you can die instantly with a single blow and in certain time not even with 3 hits which makes it very irritating with the same demon.
"Definitely my type of fast action shoot em up game but I cannot get past the everything red! I've now played maybe 3 hours and am going to uninstall it. You cannot compare this games graphics to the new uncharted, Clyberpunk or even a lot of the older games such as Shadow of Mordor and Metal Gear Solid V. Very disappointed."
Bug oluyor arada. Silah değişimi yapmıyor ve vurmuyor da. Argent D'nur bölümü bug'a girdi. Herkesi öldürdüm ama portal açılmadı (Youtube'dan izledim açılıyor herkesi öldürünce). Bir de düşman çeşitliliği çok az ve yapay zeka tabiki yoktur.
"before I finished it.. I thought ""its an ok game"". but that ending scene really 'ruined' it.. I'll not play it again.. because its just not a fun game (IMHO).. sure the graphics are pretty good.. but a good game is more than just graphics and a bit of gameplay! and there are too many faults..

to start with, it does at least have a better story, with more detail than the original doom (which I played a LOT when it came out).. but the one thing I do despise in these games is being unable to go back through a door that I just came through! and I really dislike having to replay something time and time again because I 'made a mistake'.. e.g. jumped off something that I shouldnt have (or purely miscalculated a jump) or went right instead of left.. or got stuck in some area I cant get out of!! I loathe checkpoint games.. and some of the 'challenges' are just time wasters.. theres no 'challenge'.. its just replaying it time and time again until you get it right.. and the 'secrets'.. what a joke.. some you just walk into.. and others are so ludicrously difficult to find, you could spend literally 100s of hours looking for them (even with the secret finder 'skill')! I personally dont consider that fun.. there are many other issues, hence my 'recommendation'.."
No sex with demons 1/10
"Bad boring game. It's very bad and inappropriate. It has no story and repeats itself every ""mission"". Not fun at all. That doesn't mean I'm bad at the game, I'm actually very good. But it's boring and dumb."
"IT WAS GAME OF THE YEAR. EASY.

now i can't even recommend it. every time i start it up, it decides to rearrange my multi-screen setup. my secondary goes from 3440 to 836x624 because why not. also this is the monitor it starts on. it is NOT the default. if i simply switch to primary again, all settings for that monitor goes to how the game should look, but it leaves a wartorn battlefield everywhere else. oh and it changes the refresh rate as well.

AND NONE OF THIS IS BEING RESET AT EXIT BUT REAPPLIED AT STARTUP

it's fantastic. multiple games are like this. all doom. all bethesda.


tldr; game is great! behaves like a virus
also don't fuck over musicians"
Does not work with blutooth audio. Dreck.
"Not a bad game by any chance, but one with massive flaws I haven't heard a lot of people talk about, so wanted to just write down some thoughts. I would have given it a middle rating if that was possible on Steam.

So first of: the combat of the game is fantastic, as everyone and their mom have already said. It truly does feel like a true modern version of the classic Doom gameplay; running around dodging enemy fire, switching between an array of satisfying weapons on the fly and facing some very cool and well-designed demons. The soundtrack also slaps, mixing Djent and Industrial Metal to make it truly feel like a heavy metal trip through Hell.

HOWEVER; for whatever reason, this is also very retro in a way that doesn't feel like Doom, namely it seems to take a lot of ques from the original Half-Life for whatever reason. Not a bad inspiration necessarily, and the Black Mesa fan game have shown there is a lot of potential in modernizing that sort of gameplay. The problem is they decided to focus on the worst part of that game: awful first person platforming.

The amount of times I fell into a bottomless pit because the double jump didn't trigger, a ledge looked grabable but wasn't, I accidentally slipped off the edge because you run by default, etc. was way too high. This frustration is made even worse by the complete lack of a manual save function, meaning one messed up jump can have you scavenge all that health, ammo and armor all over again from the last checkpoint. I also fell through the ground several times, because Bethesda.

The story moves between ""cheesy intentional camp"" and ""actual boring fanfic writing"". When it is at its best, it knows it doesn't matter and is the stupidest concept ever made, and just exists in the background as a thin justification for fighting demons on Mars. This is a good thing. However it occasionally starts taking itself serious, having unskipable cutscenes and annoying radio dialogues that takes away from the over-the-top fun vibe and makes it feel like a generic sci-fi shooter without any charm or life.

Visually the game is beautiful, depicting Mars and Hell in vivid colors, gory intricate decorations and a lot of creative flair. It does have the same issue as the classic games however where everything within a level kinda looks the same at times, and in some cases its easy walking in circles looking for the way forward, sometimes even stumbling on secret areas thinking it is the real way to progress. Not a big deal, but I think its worth mentioning.

On the modernization side of things, they added a weapon, armor and ability upgrade system which is cool and adds some more permanent rewards for exploring. Most of these systems work pretty well and adds to the core gameplay by allowing your weapons to get even more fun to use, but they have some combat challenges that is needed to fully upgrade weapons that can be really annoying. To upgrade the Super Shotgun, you need to perform 30 double kills with the thing, something that essentially never happens in organic gameplay since it will usually kill the closest enemy instantly, meaning to get it you seem to have to slowly line up enemies and be super careful not to kill them too early. Its just odd, and makes it not worth it with upgrading everything.

All in all, it is a fun game, but a flawed game, and IMO it is nowhere near as good as other retro remakes, such as the new Wolfestein games, the new Prey, and as mentioned Black Mesa. If you're a huge Doom fan and somehow haven't played this yet, go for it. If you are on the edge, I say wait for a sale.

Also, spoiler: the game ends on a really dumb cliffhanger sequel hook, which feels really cheap."

gameplay was too slow and it sucks that you have to get melee kills constantly if you want to survive

"Sigh. Here we go.

I'm an old-school gamer. My first console was an Atari 2600, and some of my fondest memories are of me and my friends spending hours at the arcade. Growing up, I consumed gaming magazines, blew into cartridges as a means of troubleshooting, and spent far more of my time indoors with a controller in my hand than outside on my bike. My idea of a great weekend was taking turns with my friends playing Wolfenstein 3D on ""I am Death incarnate!"" while wolfing down slices of pizza and cans of Coke and rocking out to Nirvana, Metallica, and Operation Ivy. Over the decades, little has changed. Sure, I'm paying for my own gaming these days, the Coke has been swapped out for beer, and I try to lay off the pizza, but I'd still rather spend my days off on my PC than going out to see a movie or shoot some pool. That should give you some idea of where I'm coming from.

That out of the way, let me say this: DOOM is a great fucking game. Hands down one of the greatest ever made. No, not this piece of hot crap, I mean actual DOOM, with which this game has commonalities only on the surface. Next to Wolf3D, DOOM was my go-to for blood-soaked completionist speedruns on the hardest difficulty. I have a lot of good memories of that game, with the nostalgia dialed up to eleven. I am exactly the kind of person who should love this game. But I don't. In fact, I hate this fucking game- it and its sequel- and I hate them for the same reason I own them: DOOM.

Were this game titled Sinslayer or Hellspace or Coyote Vagina or anything other than DOOM, I wouldn't feel so strongly about it. I wouldn't enjoy it very much- it's not really my cup of beer- but I wouldn't hate it. I'd have played it to its conclusion and passed it off as an okay- if rather repetitive- game, and I wouldn't have given it another thought. The thing that bothers me is that this game calls itself DOOM, and DOOM it most assuredly is not. Sure, it's a FPS with space demons and it's called DOOM, but that's where the similarities end. A lot of people have cited nostalgia as a reason they enjoyed this game, but I'm convinced that none of them ever played the original, because this game feels nothing like it. At all. It feels like someone who once played DOOM thirty years ago described it to someone else, and then that person snorted a line of coke and described it to a third person, and then that person slammed fourteen Monster energy drinks and decided to make a cartoon based on the game that was described to them, and then some asshat exec with a small penis and a pretentious car paid some guys to make a game based on the cartoon so that he could make a lot of money. If there's a more fitting description of this game than that I haven't found it.

This is DOOM without the heart, the soul, the atmosphere, the aesthetic, or anything else that made the original what it was. It is a copy of a copy of a copy, with all the magic drained out of it and replaced with generic heavy metal, cartoonish demons, and repetitive arena slogs, where you are forced into a single play-style that gets real old real fast.

Anyway. I know I'm in the minority here, and I'm okay with that. It's all peaches and gravy. Thanks for reading."
ronald regan is not the final boss
Obsolete title after Doom Eternal came out. Delist it.
"Doom is modern transplant of a classic which many would say is responsible for kicking off FPS games as a genre. While others may well have enjoyed this title, I found DOOM to be more obnoxious than fun and more of slough through a C+ shooter which I easy could have skipped. While your mileage may vary, this game was not for me."

"Good game, plagued with a mixed personality

The game is checkpoint based, but strongly encourages you to explore in ways that are suicidal, which means restarting the same fights over and over again if you (like me) are terrible at jump puzzle and overly curious.
It feels like this game needs a Quick save rather than checkpoints.

Also, glory kills are fun for 2 minutes, then gets really annoying with all the flashing enemies"

Mick Gordon's work is the best part of this game. The Bethesda and id software management is well represented ingame by the various creatures of hell that you can slaughter. I downvote this because of how corporate treated Mick.
I fucking hate glory kills and unskippable cutscenes

Aggressively boring.
Less stolen material than doom eternal. Still regret giving money to Bethesda or ID given the fraud in doom eternal.
Lot of better games to play out there.
"I want to love this game. There's so much awesomeness about it.
I've put just shy of 500 hours into it.

But 7 years after its release it is STILL riddled with bugs. Not one or two. TONS of them.
Bugs that a finished game should not have.
AI bugs.
Clipping bugs.
Animation bugs.
Weapon bugs.
Movement bugs.

I've tried over and over and over to beat ultra-nightmare. Rough estimate of ~200 attempts.
Furthest I've gotten is 6th level.
I have died so many times to things outside my control that I've lost my desire to bother with ultra-nightmare.  
It's so bad that I don't even want to play DOOM Eternal.  
""Why would you one game against another???"" Because it was made by the same developers and if they didn't give a shit about the first one, they won't give a shit about the second one. Common sense.

Tonight's bug was the straw that broke the camel's back.  
It involved me jumping backward from a hellknight jump attack and the model of the hellknight ""glided"" through the air and landed about ~15-20 feet past where he should have, instantly killing me. IDK if I'm allowed to post links to clips, but I do have this one captured on video along with a few other bugs getting me killed.

Other problems I've encountered include:
* Me getting stuck in a grenade throwing animation which prevented any form of attacking
* Being pushed through the floor and dying.  
* Being pushed into stairs and not being able to move anymore. 
* Being pushed through a railing and falling to my death.
* Getting stuck in a reload animation preventing me from attacking anymore.
* Having enemies glide/teleport to places they shouldn't be and killing me (like tonight).
* The list goes on and on. I didn't take the time to write them all down.

The game, without bugs, is a solid 9. Maybe even a 9.5. It's a REALLY good game layout and intended design. However, when you take the bugs into account, the game is a 4. Maybe a 5. It really is pathetic that id software cares so little about the game that fixing these bugs isn't even on their radar. And they're not hard to fix. I say that as a computer programmer myself.
How hard is it to put a function to check if a reload animation or grenade throwing animation is complete? (Spoiler alert: Not hard at all.)
These issues could easily be patched. But id software just straight up doesn't give a damn anymore.
They've gone the route of Rockstar games and the only thing they're focused on is money. They went right onto DOOM Eternal instead of fixing the slew of problems that DOOM 2016 has.

It really does break my heart to put a ""no, I don't recommend this game"" because when the game is working it's an absolute blast to play. You get to rip through demons, tear them apart, play with all kinds of neat guns, and explore some crazy and interesting levels.
But for people like me who want to play through the hardest setting (Ultra-Nightmare) and accept the concept of ""you only get 1 life"", how many hours do you think should be wasted on deaths and failures that are 100% outside of our control? I don't think 1 hour is an acceptable answer, and yet I can assure you I've wasted hour after hour after hour of my life to bugs caused by piss poor programming and lazy debugging.

Again, I'm a programmer. I know how hard it can be to find bugs. But when you have websites like Reddit, GameFAQS, StackExchange, and many other forums with users citing plenty of problems (a lot of the time with video) and the company goes ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ instead of fixing the problems, you have to call the company a bad company. And that's what I'm doing. I'm calling them out for horrible quality control, atrocious game testing, and just not giving a damn about fixing their game.

If they don't care, how can we be expected to care?

I haven't seen an update for this game in IDK how long. It's 2023 and the glitches/bugs are still plentiful.

I officially give up. 
I will not be beating this game on Ultra-Nightmare. Not because I'm not capable, but because the cost of my free time is too damn high. I have no desire to get 2-3 hours into a game and die to someone else's lazy coding practices or inability to fully test their own code.
Being ""rewarded"" with failure for things that I have no control over is not something any dev should want associated with their game...but now when people mention this topic, DOOM 2016 will be the game I immediately think of.

Boy what a legacy."
"The combat may be fun, but you spend 80% of the time platforming or backtracking to find stupid crap like key cards. Combat only lasts like 15-60 seconds. Just as you as you start to have fun, it ends and it's back to boring shit. This game is like a bad hand job."
I do not like the publisher.
"looking past the big name everyone is such a big fan of, it's hard to play this game for more than a few hours. honestly not worth 20 dollars.

all tho can't say it's not fun. just a waste of potential really.

this game feels like a early access or demo for something much greater... sadly this is a finished product. which is quite dis pleasing considering i payed 20 dollars for this game."
pooor
"I gave it a try. The soundtrack was nice. The game didn't feel even slightly doom-like.

I played Doom 1 and 2. It just doesn't feel like that. This is tediously slow. Shooting doesn't feel meaningful. I hit that thing, but it didn't even react. I guess just keep shooting? It didn't even make a noise.

The starter gun and shotgun feel absurdly weak. They added in the stupid RPG upgrade system that every other shooter has been using for decades. Why? Because everyone else is using it. That sucks. It was just stupid. slow paced, and lame. This is not doom.

Why does this game now have lore? Why am I seeing walls of text about what is going on? Why am I getting UI prompts to COMPLETELY halt the game and learn how to upgrade a weapon? I don't want that. It doesn't need that. You don't play doom to feel immersed in some weird alternate universe, where you need to talk to the blacksmith about killing 10 Cobalt’s in exchange for a better hilt for your blade. You play doom to shoot demons from hell. It just feels like they have no idea what doom was, or is, or should be. It feels like they were embarrassed that the original games didn't have the kind of deep lore that had originally been planned for the original series (Source: Masters of Doom). There was a very good reason why they didn't do that: it sucked. It was a horrible idea.

The only things this game should have focused on was: The ""feeling"" of shooting. The soundtrack. Cool monsters. Ultra fast movement.

This game had the soundtrack. Where is literally everything else?

We got a naked dude in some lab, comes across some suit, followed by an exposition dump. It's not interesting. It's not fun. It's not doom. Oh, he smashed the panel in the elevator? So we're acknowledging that none of this is interesting? So...why have any of it? It doesn't count as bucking the trend if you mock it, then follow the trend anyway. It's cowardly and pathetic.

This is not doom. This is trash."
"Played for 4 hours, closed game, now game won't open. Thanks Bethesda.

Game is fantastic when you get to pay it though!"
"pile of shit
slow game
DOES NOT HAVE GRAPHICHS SETTINGS IN MAIN MENU YOU HAVE TO WATCH 5 MINUTES OF UNSKIPPABLE CRINGY EDGYNESS IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE SETTINGS
half of the game is cutscenes
who is the edgy 11 years old who thought it was cool to add GloRY KIlLs?
shit on top of shit"
game is poorly made and shit don't buy
so boring and repetitive game its just go to room and shoot demons then go to next room and do the same
BUG LOT
"2/10 
Not sure why this game gets so many positive reviews. It's a pretty typical, mindless FPS with a bland, repetitive map and no unique weapons, enemies or gimmicks to speak of. The story is so utterly trite that it would have been better without any story elements at all. Got bored and quit halfway through."
"Trash wormy company that tries to fuck over their music artist.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a2pRddbbrU"
"Boring , overated"
"I don't think there are good sound cues for enemies and they bleed into the environment and one another and makes it hard to keep track of who is who and what they're doing. But the breaking point for me is probably the deathpits. Any ledge where if you fall off you're dead. In the frenetic action of a shooter like this you can easily lose track of where you are and plummet to your death. Happened one too many times for me so I'mma  leave a negative review. Honestly, I'd prefer just invisible walls over having to deal with reloads."
Lying about Mick Gordon smh
"I wanted to listen to heavy soundtracks and shoot demons. Instead, I spent 70% of the time navigating some labyrinths, listening to the story I don't care about and collecting pickups. Maybe it gets better over time, but I gave it ~1.5 hours and it was the most boring gaming experience I had in years. I'd rather play DOOM (1993) than waste a single more minute in this one."
bruh i cant sex the pink demon
Overrated game honestly
"4/10
DOOM has many fun and good aspects and many I didn't favor. Most people know what this game is all about, but for those who don't, you run around shooting and slaying demons to save the planet. I liked the weapon variety, the story was not bad and has great graphics. The level design was good, the layouts of the levels are set up pretty well, and never felt lost or confused. I disliked the overall gameplay. It felt like any other game, nothing that stands out. I didn't care for the music, leveling system was disappointing, and just felt like a basic game. If you wait for a sale it could be worth trying, but I don't see myself replaying this game or either getting the next one."
"I've tried a lot of stuff to get this to work without a keyboard and mouse on the Steam Deck and nothing seems to work. I hear it's possible but I haven't found a way yet. Makes it a little hard to enjoy on the go. Also works on Ubuntu Linux with a keyboard and mouse but not with a controller.

Got it working myself. Had to turn off cloud synchronization and delete this folder: /home/deck/.steam/steam/userdata/<steamid>/379720/"
Repetitive and dull.
Can't sex the demons :(
"Listen, this is my own opinion so don't get mad at me because of it; I try to be respectful and still say it the way I see it.
You will have fun with this game for one hour... after that fun hour you will repeat the same action for the entirety of the game - there is not enough content to feel that your journey is worth it, you will quickly upgrade your weapons and never use them ever again, except when you don't have any ammo for the guns you've used for all missions before that one, being precise, the last mission is the only moment you will use all your guns, the rest of the game, such action is not required.
Speaking of guns, the single gun I've decently liked was the super shotgun.
In the early and mid game you feel that there is a lack of action, what you're doing when not fighting is to search for doom dolls, secrets, challenges to upgrade your silent protagonist, you will be done with those very quickly and you will feel empty, subsequently the repetition will install itself and you will just want to be done with it, then, you will have some action but before that happens you will not want it any longer.
The map can be buggy, if it keeps moving for no reason just press the keys W A S D, it will stop doing it.
It has also crashed on me to the point where I couldn't exit the application, not even with the task manager; except those little things, the game has worked fine, at least it doesn't have many bugs and glitches.
Story? The game has three characters, you get little story points from three to three missions and when that happens they don't mean anything, they're just there.
Nothing else could be said, this is all you do, you search for dolls / secrets, you shoot your gun, you move to the next zone, you shoot your gun, you search for dolls / secrets, you fight a boss, the strategy for all boss fights is to move from left to right while jumping, from right to left while jumping  and as you do, to shoot your gun, you will have a big surprise when you decide to play the game this way, they will die and you will pass your level!
I understand this is a return to the old franchise but I want more, this is a 2016 game, if you're going to recreate the classics, you will have to add a new sauce to keep your food fresh and tasty.
This is my first encounter with the Doom series, it hasn't left a good impression on me.

5 / 10."
"There is no feedback or visual input to let you know you are in danger. Makes the whole game stupid, they expect you to monitor your health and constantly track targets. I only have one set of eyes and the design of this game is lazy and stupid."
"I get that the game has nostalgia for players of the originals and would absolutely be up some peoples' roads, but it's not my cup of tea. The graphics are good, the game is well optimised, but the gameplay is mostly repetitive and the story is rather boring."
mid tbh
Grossly overrated. Nothing more than a string of area locked hoard attacks glued together to form confusing stage layouts. Executions drop health so get used to watching those over and over again. Upgrade system and collectables feel completely out of place. Weapons don't have any weight to them. I don’t know who Marty Stratton is and at this point I’m too afraid to ask.
"Unskippable dialogue and terrible pathfinding. I just wanna rip and tear, i don't care about finding the hidden funko-pop figures."
Meh
really wanted to play it but doesnt load...
"https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce

The soundtrack is at least half of this game heart.
Mick Gordon deserved better."
"The game  is basically about running around and killing monster with no story ,nothing in between 
like a arcade game from the 80""s but with much better graphic's
I'm playing on the easiest setting and still can not kill hell gate keeper  , fuck this game !!!"
can't skip cutscenes
"From what I've read fuck Marty Stratton and ID, theyre scum"
"To be honest, this game just made me feel... Terrified?
I don't know, instead of feeling like a power rush, playing DOOM made me super paranoid :/
I really wanted to like it"
"played 14hrs, worse than eternal + still salty from corruption of my 14hrs played save file that i didnt get back"
"I wanted to like this since I love OG Doom, but all the levels just feel like a never-ending sequence of arenas rather than actual levels. It's kind of like Doom 3 where you'd go into a room, the same group of enemies spawn in, kill them, repeat ad nauseam, there's no flow to it."
keycard finding simulator
"I certainly enjoyed the game, it just felt boring. Boredom in a doom game is not good. The combat was alright, didn't feel amazing, guns were decent or just interesting, rarely fun to use. Music is fucking GONE at some points where I wanted it, should've pressed more into it considering this is literally a doom game. If you like the doom franchise, get this game. I don't regret my purchase, but I was left wanting more."
"An FPS straight from the nineties with modern graphics slapped on top of it. Dull environments, criminally weightless and boring guns, uninspired enemies and tedious level design. What's worse, the oh-so-lauded soundtrack actually plays pretty rarely in the game and is buried very low in the mix for some reason."
"Honestly I thought it was really boring and repetitive lol.

Having to constantly check the map was annoying as hell too

Music is based though"
"Do not understand why people love this game. Perhaps I just don't like the genre as a whole, but I would not recommend based on my experience."
"WELL the settings are absolutely horrible, meny is a sack of shit... crosshair all the way out in the right side... yawn!! get better at making games you greedy fucktards!!"
Boring game
"Can't remap all keybindings?? Game speed feels like it's made for hyperactive teenagers, man I got old."
I honestly didn't expect such a stupid bug to be in a very known game. Like why is it when I scroll to change my weapons in game the Discord chat that is in the other monitor scrolls too? I can't keep my focus and I am slowly getting sick of it! If there are any community guides or fixes please reply to this review.

A thoroughly downgraded version of Painkiller for people who have never played a videogame in their lives; It's not DOOM.

People who threatened Mick Gordon over the sequel of this formula should legit hang themselves in a friendly match of Halo: Combat Evolved

"dogshit game music good bad devs 

DUke nukem better 

loser neck beard game"
my piss would hit harder than starting weapon
ID Software is a stain.
"The Pros:

Amazing Soundtrack, it was genuinely some of the best music I've heard, well, ever.
Glory kills are pretty cool, if have limited animations.
The guns are pretty cool, but I feel they were a little uninspired at times.
The BFG is just fucking awesome.

The Cons:
Way too short. 8 hrs for an AAA game? (I played on the 2nd hardest difficulty)
The guns all shine in certain scenarios, but sometimes it is a lot better to just spam the same two over and over until something dies.
The final boss was incredibly disappointing. One phase, not hard, and felt more like a damage sponge than a boss.
Story was very straightforward. I don't know if I'm just used to Fromsoft games or what, but the whole thing was kinda meh.

Really hope it's polished up in Eternal."
"Cannot in good conscience leave anything other than a negative review until id Software and Bethesda have taken appropriate action to pay what composer Mick Gordon is owed for his work, and repair his reputation that they have damaged with spurious allegations.

Context for those uninformed : https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce"
Annoying no manual save game. No want to scout for secrets and stuff and lose all before going to next check point. Really stupid for a PC game.
"Great game, Great soundtrack.  Please do not devolve to the pedantic of exploitation, especially someone whose efforts is quite instrumental to your product.  This is not what we expect from corporations."
Kinda boring ngl
"I refused to buy Doom Eternal, i waited initially for the game to come out after loving the first game and loving the soundtrack over anything else in the game. Then the news with their composers came out and the soundtrack for eternal did not seem right, as more has come out i am very happy with my decision. ID software's choice to not only refuse to pay the original composer but attempt  to destroy his reputation with false stories. All in all its doom we know it well. But i will not support a company that has been caught in blatant lies and show no morals. values and decency to respect the people that have made their product sell-able."
If you're here you probably know what DOOM is. Should you play it? Probably. Would I recommend it? No I found it kind of boring. The Super Shotgun(tm) is nice and meaty though.
Christ this game fucking sucks. I honest to god had a much more enjoyable time playing doom 3 on PS3.
"NOTE: This is essentially a copy paste of my review of Doom Eternal

Doom is a great game, however the way id Software (**Under Marty Stratton**) allegedly abused Mick Gordon both mentally and financially, in the development of its sequel Doom Eternal leaves me appalled.
Due to this, I will leave my review as negative.

EDIT:
While Bethesda has responded with a public statement backing id Software and subsequently the actions of Marty Stratton, they have yet to properly release evidence to support their claim, unlike Mick Gordon.

Because of this, I will only change my review to a positive if either the following occurs:
(a) Marty Stratton is fired / Mick Gordon is offered reparation + public apology, with Marty Stratton's redit post being taken down.

(b) Bethesda and id Software properly prove their narrative with strong evidence that challenges Mick Gordon's claims, and thus support the notion that they are indeed being attacked by Mick Gordon. 

Additionally, here are the links to corroborate my view 
Mick Gordon's evidence:

bethesda is a super fucking garbage company. fuck marty stratton.
"I know that I'm a minority here, but I really don't like this game.
And I like old shooters, like Doom, Duke and especially Quake.
Yes, the game is polished and fluid, so what? 
The aesthetics is cartoonish, and lacks of the atmosphere and the old Doom biomechanical terror.
The glory kills force you to play always in the same way, bad addition. Furthermore, they become repetitive very soon.
The OST is beautiful, better aspect of the game. But it kicks in rarely, usually there are only ambient sounds.  
I have been so disappointed in playing this title, expecially by knowing the general enthusiasm. I do not recommend it."
I'm not supporting anything else from id Software as long as Marty Stratton is involved.
Yuck Bethesda
Justice for Mick Gordon!!!
Bad company
I was only here for the music and I guess it's time for me to end my friendship with ID Software
justice for mick
Wish I could like this game.
Mick Gordon deserves better
Justice for Mick Gordon
Mick Gordon deserves better
did mick gordon dirty
Bethesda screwed Mick Gordon just like they have screwed every game franchise under their umbrella. Can't wait to see how bad they fuck up Elder Scrolls next!
"Boycott id software, Mick Gordon deserves better"
Marty Stratton is a scumbag. Give Mick Gordon his pay.
"Bethesda has made its decision, choosing to double down on supporting the predatory, uncouth members of id software, Marty and Chad. Bethesda, by extrapolation, does not respect its contractors, choosing instead to champion toxic execs and Chads that claim ownership on works they contribute next to no effort towards. Bethesda is plummeting towards the title of their fourth elder scrolls game: Oblivion. At this rate, their moral compass is sinking straight to EA/Ubisoft. This company is not worth supporting."
An amazing game made by a god-awful company!
"id, Bethesda, and Zenimax can all go to hell."
May your troubles be many for what you did to Mick Gordon
"Constantly blocks, cannot play"
Justice for Mick Gordon. Fuck Marty Stratton
This is the only power we have as consumer after we already spoke with our wallet.
Mick Gordon
"Justice for Mick Gordon.

Marty Stratton, Please resign and leave ID Software."
"I used to have extremely fond memories of this game. Now, as soon as the game's incredible soundtrack starts to play, it immediately reminds me of Mick Gordon and what he went through at the hands of iD and especially Marty Stratton. Game is poisoned for me now, a bit like the first scene of Dumbo.

If you intend to go back and play this game, do not research the drama; it will give you a gross feeling about supporting iD Software."
"Id causing shit with Mike Gordon.
Fuck you Id"
"Marty Stratton should be fired:

"Good game but poor behind the scenes mess, super sad to see happen."
"Fuck Marty, lying piece of shit. You should be the one without a professional career left, you disgusting corporate slave."
basic boomer shoot done better by numerous developers that actually pay their staff and give them reasonable terms. do not give them a cent.
Pay Mick Gordon for his music!
"its okay, for me personally its just too easy and kinda bland honestly. some of the design of the monsters and some of the levels look out of place and weird and argent enegy tower as a level sucks. it also features the usual boring key hunt resident evil-like but way more shit than resident evil's key hunts which makes the key hunt parts boring and forgettable and some levels feature a random massive difficulty spike. also @#$% you id software.

(WARNING THIS REVIEW IS MY OPINION, YOU CAN THINK THIS IS PEAK FICTION AND I WILL NOT GIVE A SHIT, THIS IS JUST MY OPINION ABOUT THE GAME)"
Id fucked over mick gordon
What a bunch of scumbags. Did you read Mick Gordon's full statement about the Doom Eternal soundtrack?
"Hey Marty! Hey id!

Pay and respect the people that helped you rebuild DOOMs fame.

Fuck you!"
pirate it
Take a look on Reddit to read how they treat their contractors and see if you still want to buy the game.
Give justice to the man who gave your videogame it's whole soul and made it undoubtedly better and memorable. Mick Gordon deserves better.
There were a lot of demons but I didn't see Marty Stratton so I must've missed him. 0/10  experience.

Pay Mick Gordon for his work you cheap fucks
level design sucks
"Doom 1 and Doom 2 were better - more interesting graphics, better feedback when you are hit (your face + sound + screen flash)

I think in fact Dooms 1 and 2 graphics are better (despite being dated).

Plus it has working save and load anywhere, not stupid checkpoints."
"Gave me corrupt save file after 2 hours of playing, I know it isnt too bad but it just killed my enjoyment."
"demon killing the video game. if you wanted something interesting, you've come to the wrong game. it just killing with loud music playing in the background for hours. people who claim this game is a masterpiece are crayon eaters who have the attention span of a goldfish"
"If you enjoy spending 2 hours trying to stop the frame cap from jumping around from 30 to 60 to 75 to uncapped and whatever the fuck it feels like every 5 minutes, this is the game for you. 
Absolute trash, add a frame cap option instead of making people mess with your shitty v-sync settings for years, to no conclusion.
Thanks for wasting my time."
Glory kill glory kill glory kill glory kill glory kill glory kill. Oh snap missed that glory kill demon regained his health in an infinite loop. Rip what could have been a fun shooter and in turn is ruined with dead stops in action to GLORY KILL. Also a shame after a huge bloody battle you look back and see nothing because bodies despawn in seconds.
"Its super short and there aren't enough enemies to shoot, Im not satisfied"
"Music and graphic is even alright.
Solo game: 4/10.
Multiplayer: 2/10.
Overrated game."
It is unfortunate that Bethesda games can only be played in Latin Spanish on consoles and not on PC.
no sex
god this game is fucking boring...
"Ultrakill ruined me like massive horsecock. Doom isn't even in the same universe.





This ad has been brought to you be New Blood Interactive"
"Trash game, crashes all the time. somehow made it to mid game then the game told me my save file was corrupted. asked for refund and see how it goes"
fuck lifesteal
shooting is weak as fuck. headshots are not satisfying at all. Better go play some real shooters like blood or cultic
"Endless shooting and circling grows tedious with time, which is a shame as lots of work has clearly been put into this game"

"boring

first Wolfenstein, now this? I'm beggining to think Bethesda can't make good FPS"
It was alright but didn't make me excited to buy the next installment. Played on the hardest difficulty. The multiplayer doesn't appeal to me.
Annoying checkpoint save system
"I had a problem with the game crashing constantly. Apparently the solution was to disable v sync, which did solve it, but I'm leaving this as a negative review because apparently this is an issue affecting anyone using a G sync or Freesync monitor so that's a pretty major bug to still have 6 years after release now."
The game's constant and boring
HORRIBLE on lower end devices like laptops and the Nintendo Switch.
"I...guess this is just not for me, I couldn't enjoy it
Everything felt so repetitive and I couldn't force myself to finish the last two levels"
never loads stuck at 78%
"Buggy as fuck since this is a bethesda game, starts in the wrong resolution or on the wrong monitor every single time. It happens in every bethesda game. Game is fine, company producing it is not"
★★☆☆☆ It's not a shooting game. It's jump king + room escape.
"was just kind of boring, was pretty much doing the same thing on different maps over and over."
"I was really trying to enjoy this game but after playing Ultra Kill I was looking for another good movement shooter to play, Now I knew this would be slower paced than UK but the fact that it's just small combat sections with prolonged and encouraged exploration in a game that was advertised to be non-stop gory action just really bored me

The combat that there was felt decent though, The lack of hit indication didn't help the feel though and the story was alright.

Update nearly 2 years later: I gave the game another chance and got further this time, I still stand by what I said, the near forced exploration and super short combat sections really kill this game"
Only being able to save at checkpoints is no fun. One should be able to save any time especially when one trys something dangerous. I quit!!!
My save game corrupted more than halfway through the game on the highest difficulty. Fuck you.
"The game isn't very fun.  I was convinced to buy this instead of Eternal, i was in the mood for a quick easy fps and it didn't even deliver on that.  I didn't get Eternal because I didn't want something difficult but this wasn't it.  It's a awkward in between between too easy and a fun satisfying gorefest, it's just not fun.  Get Eternal it's better at both aspects than this one."
"on one level if u enter through the wrong door u literally get softlocked and have to restart the whole game. *puts on a mask made of human feces very reminiscent to that of [i] 'The Bullshit Man'  [/i]  à la James Rolfe's internet series [i] 'You Know What's Bullshit?!' [/i]

"Stop looking for a reason to not buying this game, Go get it now."
keeps crashing
No Nightmare/Ultra-Nightmare achievement nor any kind of reward. Sadge.
"The game is really good actually, but Doom Eternal exists and pretty much makes this game obselete in terms of gameplay and level design and lore and visuals"
"For people who just enjoy blood gore and shooting this game is for you, i am a heavy rpg and rts player so my only reason for thumbs downing the game is simply because its not my style."
"Game is absolutely broken. If you have an AMD GPU sorry, cant play a game from 2016 cause they wont fix it. Thanks Bethesda."
"Says i have 95 hours but ive never been able to play. On PC i cant disable gyro controls, and it doesnt accept input on the deck."
"Why?

Why do game designers still put jumping puzzle levels in first person shooter video games? Why do they think that when we buy a Doom title we have any interest in playing Super Mario Bros?"
this shit game every time i luanch game my save game has deleted
"I tryied to play the game but an error is happening blue screen and the computer is rebooted, I couldn't play it"
"Half of the charm of this game is in Multiplayer, which is not as lively now as it released years ago. If you have a lot of friends or people to play with, then take it as it is. But otherwise I suggest if you buy this then buy it on a sale so you can enjoy the other half, which is the story campaign, without losing too much value."
"F this atmosphere ,surroundings and enemies. ...but never want to play doom games even for free.
never rushed anything ass this game.

5.5 - 10
 
fuck mars and hell."
"Singleplayer mode gets boring in a matter of hours and multiplayer is the single most frustrating pile of garbage I have seen in years.

And for God's sake, if the game can't even focus the mouse so that it doesn't go off to another screen no matter which mode you're using, what can you expect from the game?

--- EDIT---

I want to continue this review by saying that if you want to play this game, PIRATE IT. Just pirate it. You can thank me later when you can play the campaign and have more or less fun in there when some bug doesn't get you killed (like occasionally clipping through floors to your death after a glory kill). But stay the F*CK away from multiplayer. Barely anyone playing this game anymore, always at least one cheater in every match because of the lack of any anti-cheat and quickswitching weapons takes away the purpose of any remaining sense and purpose.

---FINAL EDIT---

DONE! Last achievement ripped out! And I straight up refuse to play this game ever again. Keep your f*cking game, script kiddies. Even TF2 isn't as bad multiplayer in this game and that should say a LOT."
boring
"If boomer shooters were a thing then this would be the poster child. It's tedious, dull, repetitive and unashamedly so to such an extent that I don't even know if that's a bad thing. I mean I don't like those weirdly realistic hunting games so it feels a bit like criticising one of those for spending too much time on waiting for a duck to appear. Doom however is bland so if that's all part of the boomer shooter appeal then fine but this game has incredibly dull graphics (Quake 3 levels of brown, grey and dark green bland) with uninspiring enemy variety, way too many upgrade systems which is somehow cancelled out by none of them being interesting, a deliberately tongue in cheek crap story with the joke being that even the protagonist doesn't care and combat that reaches the lofty height of being okay.

You run, you shoot, you jump (or not since jumping mostly results in instant death) and you tediously use finishers to get more health or ammo. The whole finisher mechanic might have been fun if it weren't overused but you'll have to use it constantly because the games combat is designed around seeing each enemy as a particularly rascally packet of chips that can only be opened by pulling their tits off first. As a result it stops being fun after the first few goes and instead simply slows down the combat which is otherwise fine albeit hamstrung by enemies telegraphing their appearance five miles in advance with obnoxious screams, glowing red light and a ticker-tape parade announcing any new types.

I guess if you like generic run and gun shooters which give zero shits about story, character development, interesting visuals or any video game developments this side of the millennium then this is the game for you. Personally I'd rather go to a pilates with galloping diarrhoea then play this visual equivalent."

"The visuals are cool and animations are cool, but the gunplay sucks."
"It's a turn-based strategy for people who are uncomfortable with the blazing speed of Windows Solitaire. DoomGuy seems to be fat, lazy, pregnant, both legs broken and have a hangover.

Game is painfully slow and this is intentional to push you into the very specific way of play, like glory kills, chainsaw etc. to show you cutscenes."
a whole lotta nothin just to get a 15 seconds of a banger that is constantly being interrupted by glory kills

This game just does not hold up. Its brought down by tiny little details that add up and make it overall worse. Shields don't matter. Pinky's AI is broken. The regular shotgun becomes useless after you get the super shotgun. The checkpoints are too few and far between. You can die in the midst of grabbing a ledge or doing a glory kill. Obviously all of these things are fixed in Doom eternal NOW but that just makes this title more sad.
can't skip start logos etc
"definitely a good game, be warned tho, game will crash depending on your driver, and can be quite difficult to fix"
doeset run on widows. or any machine or electonic. hi dont know they got away this? selling the concept of a doonis such a down grade of this oringal
"Typical Bethesda game I guess.

Pistol weapon firing can get stuck losing control of the shooting completely and cant do anything.

Another franchise ruined by Bugthesda garbage"
Id Software panders to manchildren: the video game
Glad i got this on a sale absolute pile of trash. Much preferred the old doom.
i kept getting an FATAL ERROR: wglCreateContextAttribsARB failed
"Honestly very mediocre. Combat has no weight to it, no sense of mass. The weapons are forgettable and uninspired. And forget about any sort of difficulty, because as soon as you start running low on health, you can just mash up one of the many flashing blue goons and jump right back up to half a bar. It doesn't feel like a Doom game of any sort, it feels like Unreal Tournament. 

At least I only spent a few bucks on this."
"I really wanted to play this game, but the sound effect, the ping everytime you pick up health makes me go fucking bonkers. I can't stand high pitch sounds like that... Anyway, waste of time."
"Man this game's just a downgrade from DOOM 3. Like the lighting is ass, the gameplay is boring, the story is trash like dude, choose a struggle please!

Just play DOOM 3 BFG Edition instead, worth ten times more of your time than this trash game."
"Doesn't launch and hasn't been patched for months it seems. 
I'll sadly have to refund it.

It's still a great game tho played it on console and had a blast with this game."
could not hear game audio
"dont buy, this game is genuinely fucking awful. the ammo system sucks absolute ass and there is no difficulty whatsoever.

dont even get me started on how slow and boring the actual gameplay is"
"I did not expect this to disappoint me so much - The weapons feel unsatisfying to use (except of course Glory Kills!) and the bosses are just not fun. Storywise, it's also way too short"
bad game..and stole my game..when i buy game from steam..

i realised i had no ammo
so i had to use the gun you get at the start of the game 
do you think i can beat her with just a beginner gun 
no i dont have the time so bye bye game :I
im lazy to restart the mission 
after this i will buy 7 days to die"
A good looking walking simulator.  30% rip n tear and 70% traversal through an empty map.

"Honestly, it is absolutely beyond me why this game receives such praise. The feel and impact of guns is very lackluster, most weapons are call of duty tier nerf guns. While the 'finish him' animations are sort of well executed, the visual damage of firearms on enemies is non-existent—aside from headshots. You might as well be shooting robots because there is no impact on the flesh.  On top of the fact that this is not a very good FPS, it forces upon you a substantial amount of parkour which in conjunction with the atrocious jumping mechanics and primitive physics is unbearable torture. Many of the maps are confusing multi-level labyrinths and you have to jump around to find whatever it is you're looking for. These interruptions to the core gameplay loop do not, in any way, add to the game but only serve to frustrate the player. Countless times I would finish a level, spend 10 minutes parkouring around just to suddenly fall into the abyss and realize that the checkpoint is at the start of the level. Lastly, ID tech engine is a steaming pile of rubbish and you are guaranteed to encounter many crashes throughout your playthrough. 

To sum up: very primitive and outdated game design, second-rate shooting experience, and terrible technical execution."
"Pretty fun game, but ruined by Bethesda level bugs and weird pathfinding/wall glitching by the demons."
Doesnt work anymore on my 1060. Takes 20 minutes to load and if I die once it freezes. FPS lags as well.
After not playing game for months game does not work. bugs. shit game
"It's a great game that for no reason at all suddenly runs like shit when it used to run amazing. I am using the same computer with basically the same components but I get sudden frame drops when it used to run at 60fps and higher, and I am not the only one experiencing this."
"kinda mid looked cooler when markiplier did it :(
gmod but blood"
Game keeps crashing on startup. I have a 3080 and this game does not launch. Garbage game
"Doom is a very well made game, but I don't like its design.  It was designed to use a ""push forward combat loop,"" and that's the problem.  It calls itself an FPS, but it really isn't.  What's worse is that it kind of thinks that it IS an FPS, so large portions of the game are based on that...but then penalize you for playing that way.

The best description for Doomguy is that he is a melee vampire.  This is absolutely true.  Despite what the lore tells you iin the first mission, the Doomsuit is absolute dogshit armor, and even the weakest enemies cut through it like butter.  The only way to stay alive is to constantly be eating health globes.  That forces a sort of frantic, always-killing type of gameplay.  Fine, great, I guess I can live with that.  The problem is that Doomguy generates health globes by doing glory kills, and glory kills are melee.  He generates ammunition by killing things with the chainsaw...in melee.  The devs REALLY wanted to make push forward combat a thing, so there really is only one way to play the game.  You either focus your entire style of play on melee, or you die.  Repeatedly.  Sure, you can use your guns, but it's only to either clear trash or to set up enemies for melee kills.  You spend every fight constantly trying to get enemies to glow yellow so you can melee them.  It honestly feels like the game PENALIZES you for accidentally actually killing things with your guns, even though almost every weapon is a gun, every upgrade is for guns, and the game is a farking first person shooter...supposedly.

If you like constantly charging and ripping things apart with your bare hands (literally), you may enjoy this game, but if you're looking for a first person shooter that you can play like a first person shooter, this may not be the game for you.  It wasn't for me."
"VERY strong aesthetic, fantastic score, brilliant production. Seriously, wow. But ASK YOURSELF:

Do you want to play through an FPS where you literally don’t stand still for 0.5 seconds? 

Yes? cool, I respect you

No: this game is not for you (but this review is)"
ill just say it; hasnt aged well
"The games not bad, I just cant get into it. It feels like the epitome of a mindless shooter. The shooting is really good and its not difficult to pick up, but theres no story, nothing to follow. The color scheme also is awful. Its like if an emo edge lord made a game...Throw satanic imagery in, make it dark, and have metal music in the background, Who cares about why youre doing what youre doing? I like Shooters, I like the composer, I even am fond of the engine...Its just, none of it was implemented with any thought in mind here. its really dumb down. Go here and shoot things...I wish there was a story, and a better color palate (one involving more than just dark red and urine yellow). I feel like Wolfenstein just did everything better with nearly the same ingredients.
Played about four hours, on the first available hard difficulty (not nightmare since that requires an unlock)."
"Maybe its because I'm playing the game wrong, but a lot of the mechanics in the game are tedious, 99% of objectives (so far, I'm only on ""hell on mars"") are look around for an item, defeat waves of enemies, walk to objective with said item, fight waves of enemies. I understand that fighting waves of enemies is kinda the point of doom, like thats the whole schtick, but the area locked wave survival gets old after a bit. The guns feel nice, and the movement is simple and works for the game style. Overall I'd give it a 4/10, fun mechanics and gun play, boring gameplay loop."
"I'm not sure how to review this game as it fits into one of those more niche categories.

1st: The Doom franchise has a long history, so no need to get into that. This version is better thought of in the context of the immersive Doom 3 (2003).
2nd: Doom 3 was [at the time] a modernized version of the classic with a tough campaign/story
3rd: 2016 Doom starts off sort of the same way as Doom 3 - you're an unnamed marine sent from Earth to stop the demonic invasion on Mars.
4th: In the real years that've passed, game visuals and mechanics have all been modernized.
5th: 2016 Doom seems to assume that some success has been achieved in Doom 3, as there's no seeming campaign and it's just keep killing demons.

Final verdict: This seems to me like a 'continue playing' option to Doom 3. I got bored immediately (I'm one of those 'campaign' people unless the game is really special), and stopped immediately as you can see by my play time."
no clue why I dislike it so much but I really like DOOM Eternal
I LOVE DOOM
Game sucks ass it fucking won't even let me fix the steam cloud error fuck DOOM 2016
"Solid gameplay, delightfully graphic murder and gore at every corner, a lot of references to the older titles and a true powertrip fueled by the realization YOU are the boogeyman the DEMONS scare their children with.

Buuut, the story is expectedly simplistic, and whilst you get more and more enemy types up to a certain point in the game, it nontheless manages to get stale and repetitive towards the later bits, with the difficulty only being increased by putting you into into ever longer fights with fewer checkpoints. Also, oddly enough, I found that the very first weapon (past the lol-pew-pistol) and the very first mod remained my go-to weapon of the choice throughout the entire game, until the railgun came about, at which point I was using two weapons. Maybe just a playstyle choice.

In the end, I don't really feel like the game is worth replaying, which, at 10h, is not the best hallmark. 

Probably get it at a sale, but don't expect anything mind-blowing out of it.
I'll go for a neutral rating here, which, given the otherwise positive score, means a disrecommend."
"FULL OF DEMONIC INFLUENCE AND/OR PORTALS
Ephesians 6:10-18
New International Version
10 ""Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. 11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.

18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people."""
bad
"Game gets stuck between loading screens, have to hard kill the game and after that the computer works fine but if I turn it off or restart it the hard drive has to go to a recovery mode for some reason, only happens after playing this game."
"as far as RPGs go Doom has to rank somewhere near the top:

Pros: 
- slick controls, lots of weapons
- not much in terms of plot but the characters are as intricate as Dart, Lavitz and the rest of the Legend of Dragoon cast
- makes u feel like a complete badass
- no enemy sponges
- doesn't overstay its welcome but has plenty of replayability/NG+ features à la Chrono Trigger
- there's a total of 5 minutes of forced cutscenes, otherwise go ham, king

Cons: 
- very little variety in terms of dialogue choices
- no Pacifist run? 
- the enemies scream too loud it's aggravating
- single-handedly responsible for the ""Video games make u violent"" narrative
- enemies are bullet sponges
- lack of realism (how would people get to Mars anyway)

Overall I give this game the highest score imaginable"
I was having a good time until the game would get stuck 95% loading and then never finish and when I got the BFG it crashed the game and I couldn't even force quite it
soooooo bad wa rb al 3bad
Mid game
"So the main problem I have with this game is the secret areas.  It has cool hidden switches and secret areas to unlock just like the original Doom but in the original these rooms just had extra health and ammo and stuff.  Maybe you could even get a new weapon half a level sooner than you would pick it up normally.  That was your reward.  In this new game the secret areas all contain PERMANENT upgrades to your character.   This punishes the player if they miss even a single secret.  You feel like you HAVE to 100% all secret areas, especially if you are playing on harder difficulty levels.

That makes it so now you feel compelled to use a walkthrough so you dont miss anything and this really slows down the gameplay and makes it much more of a chore.  I like the permanent upgrades in this game and it makes sense for secret areas to have them to make finding the secrets rewarding, but they need a way to make 100%ing them unmissable either by letting you warp back to cleared levels (Not REDO the level with full respawns, I mean just go back to an empty zone) or they need some kind of in game map/secret tracker thing that can show you where they are and make sure you don't accidentally progress to the point where you cant go back and get them.  Like maybe after you beat the levels boss or something you can get the secrets marked on the map.  Whatever, just dont make these secrets missable!  It's really really annoying."
cant play for more than 20 minutes without a splitting migraine. does not happen with other games for me. still fun
Play Ultrakill
"After several hours:

Level design is confusing as hell (lol!)
Weapons feel very, very weak and clips are far too small.
Platforming in FPS is just a lesson in frustration - I'd play Mario if I liked platformers.

The music was excellent, however.  Maybe I'll just buy the soundtrack to the follow-up Doom Eternal instead of the game.

Glad I didn't pay full price, after the truly abysmal tower level I'm using dev mode just to see the game through.  nuDoom just isn't for me."
bad
"I've been caught in yet another conundrum of journalist ethics.  I didn’t care for Doom, I found it to be monotonous and boring, the music was fine, the levels looked very nice but apart from that they were fine.  So by all means it should get a thumbs down, a red mark because I didn’t like it.  End of story.

The problem is Doom is a very well made game.

In no universe can you say Doom is objectively a bad game.  You can say you didn’t personally like it, but you can’t say it’s intrinsically a bad game.  The shooting, though I found it to be repetitive, is satisfying in all the right ways and all the guns carry a nice punch to them.  The Ai is reactive enough to put up a fight but stupid enough to still make you feel like a badass.  All the animations are smooth.  The gameplay loop is simple but effective.  The music is very well composed and fits the aestetic well.  The levels are open ended but still carefully built to give fights a natural flow, making each fight unique regardless of times played.  The levels themselves are all very pretty and have a shocking amount of detail in every corner.  Even the story is surprisingly well written, acted, and executed despite it not needing much of one.

By all means this is the video game of video games, if that makes any sense.  It is meant to be fun first and cannot be replicated on any other form of media.  The feeling it tries to capture can only be done through the medium of video games, and it does a damn good job at it too.

So why didn't I like it?  How can I praise a game but at the same time give it a thumbs down?

I’ve played a lot of games in my time.  Probably too many to be healthy and though it’s done little for me in terms of practical application it has, at least, given me a broad understanding of the medium.  In that time I’ve played a lot of games I’ve liked and even more that I didn’t.

It’s usually pretty easy to tell the difference between a game made by a bureaucratic team trying to maximize profits vs a game made by a passionate team of developers who wanted to make a fun game.  Of course there are exceptions on both sides (Mafia: Definitive and Far Cry 3 come to mind) but for the most part it’s fairly consistent.

You can feel the love put into Doom.  How every aspect was created with the specific intention of making the game fun.  The interesting story and beautifully crafted maps are just icing on the cake.  It really is a great game.

So when it comes down to what I actually don't like about the game it can be kind of hard to put into words.

This is of course a “me” problem and I am in the vast minority here.  All my friends who’ve played Doom love it and sing its praise.  It just doesn’t scratch the same itch for me, it doesn’t click.  I don’t get that heart pounding dopamine strike from the fast paced action of Doom.  I get about the same amount of enjoyment out of a Call of Duty campaign.

Now I’m not saying Call of Duty is anywhere close to the level of polish and quality of Doom I’m just saying I have about the same amount of fun.

It’s kind of weird too because I’m not adverse to fast paced violent games.  I love Hotline Miami, Black Mesa, TF2, and Wolfenstein.  Though not the same design philosophy as Doom these games cater to a similar gameplay loop and style.  But for some reason Doom ends up lower on my list then the others.

Maybe I’m a nihilistic prick who hates video games, maybe I’m to stupid to get it.  Or maybe I’m just too pretentious and think I'm above it all.

I think the most telling thing I can put here is my favorite Doom is Doom 3, the game that is the least like Doom out of the franchise.  I like the tight corridors, dark atmosphere, and slower more methodical gameplay.  That’s just more my speed.

Doom is a fine game, maybe even a great game, that I didn’t like.  And that’s okay.  

Is it worth picking up anyway?  Honestly, yes, chances are you will enjoy this game even if I didn't, so I don’t know why I even took the time to write all this out.

7/10 - Yes, yes, I know a high score for a thumbs down but I can’t help it, it’s a well made game giving it a lower score based on my own biases wouldn’t be fair to the devs.  It's a useless review score by some nobody on the internet get over it."
"I like the DOOM game very much, but one problem that bothered me a lot was that I can't connect to the servers of this game because of the sanctions in my country (Iran) and it bothers me a lot. I hope all the people of the world can freely enjoy the video game."
Guns lack punch and you spend more time looking for ammo than actually shooting things. If you want mindless action there's way better alternatives than this garbage.
kkaka
"great game, looks amazing and gameplay is probably really good. unfortunately for me its broken and crashes every time i try to play it. and its not a pc issue as i can run doom eternal at higher settings with no issues. never even got to the first battle room."
"Extremely slow and boring, Eternal is SO much better.

Probably was designed for old Boomers with the Reflexes of Sloths."
"Feels like an enormous downgrade after playing doom eternal, slow clunky takedowns, demons look off and gunplay feels worse. Play doom eternal instead"
"Great game but IMO doesn't deserve better review score than doom eternal so a thumbs down!!!
But still a great buy just play it before playing eternal"
i keep crashing 10 secs into the game i have a good pc and my radeon app says that a driver has malfunction but i updated them all and still did nothing
Annoying stuttering on a RTX 3070!! asked for a refund 20 min after.
"I fell pretty disappointed, having finally played the game. I loved watching DOOM videos on the internet, like playthroughs, boss fights, etc. But in reality it felt soo boring and repetitive. The story is laughable, so treating it like a FPS game i'll say it's good. Not a fan of the level construction. I got it for €4.99 on the Summer sale, there are much better purchases than this.
5/10"
krews kreod mesf resac rels dela :P
"I tried to play this game multiple times, but just couldn't make my self continue playing it. It feels bland.
I had such high hopes from the game due to the praise it receives, but I guess this game is just not for me. I really wish I could  like it, as I wanted to complete it and experience what everyone loves about this game, but I just can't force myself to play it anymore."
"Ive read alot of reviews both on and outside of steam that claim this game is either so good it cures cancer or so boring you fall asleep playing it. From my experience, I disagree with both perspectives. To keep it short and sweet, the first 3/4s of this game is awesome. You slowly get more and more powerful and master killing a variety of demons, not only statistically improving but getting better at the game itself. There are occasional moments where the pacing falters, either due to you spending way to long trying to figure out how to proceed with a level or mismanaging supplies (due to the fact you dont know how many more enemies you have to kill), but the game is able to consistently provide a fun slash and tear experience despite its simplicity. If you are going to play the campaign fresh for the first time like I did, I recommend using powerups as soon as you find them and not worrying about weapon/armor points. I rarely found secret areas or did challenges and had more armor/weapon/energy points then I knew what to do with. 

So why the negative review?

Roughly after the ""ice"" level, (youll know what Im referring too once/if you have finished the campaign), this game goes downhill quickly. For context, the final fight of the ice level was a long bloody and intense experience which I consider the unofficial ending of the game. Its a great culmination where you fight all the demons youve fought so far using your vast arsenal, constantly dodging and ""parkour-ing"" around the level. However after this, youre forced to play through a repetitive boring slug fest of a level which not only feels too similar to previous levels, but lacks any sense of intensity that previous levels had. At this point you also get so much ""upgrade points"" and ammo that you basically mow down everything you see easily, with no strategy required. 
WHERE ITS GETS REALLY BAD
If it was just for the cons that ive already mentioned, I probably would still recommend the game, but I have to address the disaster that is the ending.
This entire game, you feel like your tearing through a horde of the undead, clawing to get your way to some sort of a big bad guy or final battle. I was excited to absolutely pulverize one of the scientists or decapitate Satan himself. Suddenly, your thrown in front of a bullet sponge with a annoying arena mechanic. I killed it on my first try ready to continue playing the game. What I didnt realize is that it was the final boss. I imagined I would at least get a satisfying cutscene to end the  game off after such an anticlimactic gameplay ending, but I was disappointed when I saw a boring setup for a sequel with no resolution. 

While the story isnt as bad as other games like Farcry 5 or the Witcher 3, and the game has great initial worldbuilding and gameplay; the ending is so anticlimactic and disappointing that I have no choice but to not recommend."
"I wish i could love this game, but i just can't.

Early game is a grind for upgrades. There are wide open maps. A CRAP ton of lore, reading, talking, and some cut scenes where you spend most of the time wondering around and walking instead of killing demons. The fights are really just waaay to short and disappointing for a game meant to be about ripping and tearing.

I just find this game overall boring.
Buy the soundtrack. It's better than the game."
"Been troubleshooting for hours 
to fix the game audio is cutting out and crackling 
Don't get this if you use a wireless headsets"
"★★★★☆☆☆☆☆☆

4 out of 10 talamitos."
awesome game but despite having a borderless window mode it doesn't work making this game pointless with multi monitor setups.
"Very good FPS, horrible platformer."
"gameplay is fine, im sure console normies love this: it spoon-feeds you everything. mick gordon has fingers he stole from the devil and holds literally this entire game up with them."
this game sucks SO SO SO SO MUCH. avoid this crap even if its for free.
very bad performace 0/10
"This is more so a review of the Nightmare difficulty.

First impression was terrible. Sluggish combat, well your player is slow, but the enemies are fast. In fact, they are so fast, glory kills to heal you will get you killed. I play Nightmare because in Doom 2 it's fun, the enemies are already there, so keeping track of them is actually not only possible but fun, the AI can track you, especially with Brutal Doom, but it's manageable. Here, they feel like they read player input to make their aim as good as possible.

Weapon choice early on is attrocious as well, the shotgun does little damage, at close range you'll dump a 1/6th of your ammo into one enemy, but it takes so long that the other enemies in the level have caught up to you.

I can manage all of that. That's fine. It's not great. It feels terrible but I know the game does get faster.

You cannot fail fast though. In Doom 2 if you failed, you reloaded and were back in it in less than 10 seconds. In Doom 2016 you'll take a full minute of animation to get back up."
"Doom 2 player here. Doom 2016 is short, fully linear, average FPS. Very often you get lost and don't know where to go = frustration. The gameplay is too simple = just run and gun and clear one room after another (only then you will be allowed to go to another room... wtf mechanic?). The game also forces you to do arcade jumping! - one mistake and you start from the bottom = frustration. Music is only so-so. Not recommended and not worth the full price."
"I can't not play this game,

Always crash at launch, i have try to many options to fix it, but still can't play it, and can't refund it"
"feels weird and clunky, its not THAT bad of a game, but its not doom"
hella repetetive
no
"Short story: Has a fan of DOOM 1 & 2, I didn’t enjoy it one bit. You may like it if you love frantic action, maybe like serious Sam.

The original level design or DOOM 1/2, the personality of each kind of monster, the management of weapon type and ammo. Sadly, there is none of this in this Doom.

Levels are ultra linear. You move from one pseudo room to another, you take a powerup, they lock the doors behind you. 1000 monsters’ teleports around you, everything is so fast that you cannot appreciate each monster style… You just kill them so quickly… doors are now unlocked. Take spare life and ammo, then repeat.

It just gets worst the further you are in the “campaign”. Plus the bosses are not interesting at all (but that’s a tradition in Doom).

PRO
- Graphics are fine (nothing special these days)
- Buttery smooth (but who cares to run 300 fps in solo?)
- Smooth gameplay (the way you move and kill monsters)
- Skill/weapons tree

CON
- Usually no backtracking possible: means often too late to unlock some secrets of the map without replaying it.
- The skill/weapons tree does not matter much: You’ll get most of it easily by the end of the game
- Run out of ammo? No problem, just chainsaw the simple monster, and voila 80% ammo restored for all your weapons!
- There are bugs! (Seriously? This is such a simple game and I had something like 20 bugs such as invisible walls, blocked in collisions, cannot switch weapons (!))
- Old school check points (want to stop NOW and resume later? No luck, you may lose some progress!)
- You have a double jump, but a lot of “platforms” have invisible collision so you cannot jump on them."
i'm more of a grounded slayer
Bit slow. Violence always ended as I just get into it. More kill less walk
bad
"The audio just slowly cuts out and stops working when loading into any game. Then after, the game is just frozen so it's literally unplayable. Reinstalled and everything. Hoping for a fix soon."
"Just skip this and go right to DOOM Eternal. This game is objectively bad, Eternal does what it wanted to do way better, and the older doom games fit the style and game play way better. That's the tip of the iceberg.

1. DOOM, the foundation.

 2016 DOOM is a basically a re-skin of the old doom games, and they don't hide it. You'll find hidden rooms in ""reference"" to DOOM, but have you noticed the incredibly stale, closed off environments that are just part of the game? It looks to me they took the design philosophy of DOOM a little to serious. Like classic DOOM you'll be doing some backtracking for secrets and items, sometimes even for progression, in this game it's the same thing, but bigger (so worse). The reason it worked in the old games, Doomguy was fast, the levels we're tightly designed, and coded well too, of course. 2016 has NONE of that. It makes the formula, repetitive, stale, and anger inducing. Do you know how many time I've gotten stuck on slopes and railings? The inclusion of double jump nearly halfway through the game? DOG. The parts that are new they don't capitalize off of, cuz ""it's like old doom xd""

2. There's a better game waiting to be played.

 Y'all heard of DOOM ETERNAL? It's literally one of my favorite games. It has some problems but none as glaring as 2016. This will be my least touched upon point, you can read my Eternal review for more insight on what I think, TL:DR- fucking play ETERNAL.


3. Schizo screams in his room about the devs being stupid (general problems) 

There's a lot of bugs in this game. I run into 2 or 3 every level. Simple glitches like getting stuck on rails or getting soft locked (has happened 4 times now) is fine, but when it happens literally every fucking level it really starts to piss you off. Jumps not being made, ledges not being grabbed, glory kills not going off, fucking immediately going to a loading screen when you fall and die, being stuck on moving objects, lack of mobility (ik runes but tell me how far that runes is again...oh wait), bland color palette (browns, reds and blacks mostly). Honestly, these things again, aren't really to bad, it's like a 2% problem, but they literally made the perfect game after this one, so these problems are mega crippling, it's hard to for me to understand some of the choices made, but others are reasonable.


4. But Big Daddy, what was even the point?

Doom is great, I love doom. I'm really disappointed that I don't like this game, I played Eternal first and I'm glad I did, to me this game was just a stepping stone to get where we are now, another foundation for a great line of games coming. It's 2022 now, there's rumors of another DOOM coming, and I can give my thanks to this game for being the first, I can say that much about it.


24 hours of gameplay later review: I would still agree with the core of my arguments as to why this game is ""objectively bad"". Eternal is just such a massive upgrade to everything 2016 does. By no means is this game BAD, it is what it is. It's 3D DOOM, that's all it needed to be and the game is great because it sticks to that formula."
"This game doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. It keeps encouraging me to push forward from combat to combat, but then reprimanding me for not spending time to search for secrets. Then there's light platforming and lore entries? What kind of game am I playing here? Is it a shooter, a platformer, or a secret hunting game? I can't figure it out because the game includes elements of all of them to the detriment of everything.
I know the original doom games had secrets, but from what I've seen of people playing those games, most of those secrets were found along the main path of the game, and they contained enemies as well as pick ups. In short, secrets in the original games provided more of the core content of the game. Here, secrets frequently contain collectibles, lore entries, or references to the original Doom without including any enemies. They interrupt the core game play loop of shooting and collecting supplies.
The arenas for fighting the monsters are well laid out, but the secrets are either very hard to find or just laying right out in the open. There doesn't seem to be a middle ground. Apparently the devs knew how to make combat maps, but their skill for the quiet connecting bits was lacking. If the secrets had been nicely tucked away between the combat arenas to allow a quick pallet cleanser, that would have been fine, but as it is they're just a distraction.
There's a couple issues with the movement. The light platforming is really weak and detracts from the game. Doom Guy will mantle onto things if you just miss the ledge, but only some ledges have this enabled without any indicator as to which is which. This leaves you falling to your death or landing in a pack of enemies, often interrupting an otherwise enjoyable combat encounter. What's worse is when you can clearly reach a ledge, but you arbitrarily can't mantle onto it because it's not the one true preordained path to the next area set out by the devs. The enemy hit boxes are also weirdly large, so they're easy to get stuck on when you're trying to maneuver in a tight combat. I can't count how many times I tried to run around an enemy only to hit an invisible wall sticking off of the side of it.
Lets talk about the pacing. There will be a great set piece fight and I'm having fun, but then I'm off hunting for dolls or doing rune challenges to unlock upgrades, totally killing the pacing. I tried to just ignore all the extra stuff and focus on the combat, but I found after a few levels I lacked the upgrades to carry enough health and ammo to deal with the increasing hordes of enemies. I went back and replayed levels to find secrets, again totally killing the pacing of the game, but now I can progress again. What happened to Rip and Tear until it is done? I'm spending half my play time finding dolls, taking computer chips from dead guys' armor, and breaking pokeballs found in huge treasure chests. Just give a cool vista to look at between big fights or a small room to restock and I'll be good. Giving me a chore list of things to find between combats really kills the mood.
Then there's the level challenges, all of which are somewhat arbitrary tasks you do in levels to upgrade your weapons. Why do these exist? Why are you interrupting the flow of the combat, which is well crafted, by asking me to do these weird specific tasks? When I was doing them, I wasn't playing the game anymore, I was analyzing the map to figure out where the Devs wanted me to do the task, because they can frequently only be reasonably completed in one part of the level where you can find the specific elements you need to complete the level challenge. On top of that, the challenges aren't usually connected to the theme of the level at all. Why do these exist? All they do is fuel the weapon upgrade system which is its own can of worms.
Speaking of which, let's talk about the weapon upgrade system. You have to use the collectibles you pick up in the levels to unlock mods for your guns. Then you use points from the various challenges to upgrade those mods. Why is this a thing? I'm playing a shooter, not an RPG. Make the mods rewards for defeating certain enemies for the first time or progressing through the campaign. Either make the mod upgrades included by default with the mod, or make them unlock by using the mod. As it is they often unlock by completing arbitrary tasks that don't even necessarily require using the gun, you just have to complete some random task while the mod is equipped and the weapon is in hand. I'm here to run around a shoot stuff, not analyse every combat for a chance to cheese out some mod unlock progress which is what I found myself consistently doing.
Then there's the runes, oh the runes. You have to find them in the aforementioned flow breaking secret areas. When you do find them, you have to play a little mini-game to unlock them. Yep, they literally teleport you out of the level and drop you in a separate level with a specific task required to use the rune. What the heck devs? I realize this is meant to be a little tutorial on how the rune works, but they almost always only have minor passive effects. There's no need for a tutorial on getting a passive boost to things I'm already doing. If you must include passive buffs like this, again I'm here to shoot things not play on RPG, just give them to me without the mini-tutorial. It's unnecessary and flow breaking for the game.

All in all, this is a solid game. The combat and the combat arenas are really well put together. Unfortunately, the whole thing is brought down by the inclusion of these weird secret hunt side missions, randomly included RPG elements, and arbitrary tasks that aren't related to the levels or weapons their tied to. I'm sure plenty of people will love the game despite these issues, but they were so flow breaking to an otherwise excellent game that I can no longer recommend it. Yes, I did beat the game on a mid-line difficulty. Yes, I went back and found all the secrets and unlocked all of the upgrades. If you're here for pure combat or expect your games to flow smoothly from one activity to the next, I recommend you look somewhere else.

[h1]Press F to win:[/h1]
[b]M y.   G o d.[/b]  This game is so unbelievably horny for glory kills.

I'm pretty sure the working title for this game was [i]""Project Glory Kills, Glory Kills, We LOVE Glory Kills: Aren't glory kills wonderful??""[/i]

When the devs sat down to brainstorm this game, they wrote the phrase ""Glory Kills"" on the dry erase board and all other gameplay ideas were required to branch out from there.

Several months into development, one audacious developer had the brazen nerve to suggest they put something in the game that's [i]not[/i] related to glory kills. He disappeared under mysterious circumstances and was never seen again.

The company gave gifts to the devs at each holiday, but the gift was always the same; a tiny statue of DoomGuy performing a glory kill on an imp. And every Saturday, the team would take a much needed break and go around the room, describing in detail which bodily orifice they stored their statue in during the week.

They love glory kills so much, they made the chainsaw into a glory kill gun. Then they gave the glory kill gun its own set of glory kill animations. Then they gave the glory kill gun its own dedicated button you can slam at any time. You know, just in case it's been longer than 3 seconds since the last time you've had a glory kill and you're getting the shakes.

They love glory kills so much, half of the runes you get for completing rune trials are solely for buffing your glory kills. And to complete some of those rune trials, you must perform a specific number of glory kills in a limited amount of time.

But wait. Just because you unlocked the rune doesn't mean you're done unlocking it. You still have tasks to finish to unlock it some more. And how do you further unlock the glory kill buffs you unlocked by performing glory kills in a glory kill challenge? Well with more glory kills, of course! Like getting 50 mid-air glory kills, getting 76 upside down glory kills, glory killing their left leg 100 times, glory killing their phone 256 times, glory killing their wife while she's on the toilet 9001 times. Then you unlock more glory kill and your glory kill becomes the most glory kill glory kill in the glory kill!

What? [b]You say you like glory kills?[/b] Well sure you do. How could you not? You're invincible while you're performing a glory kill. And you get health for performing them. And you get armor for performing them. And you get ammo for performing them. And you get upgrades. And you get achievements. And you get Bethesda Store points. And Bethesda Store coupons. And personal ball massages. And Todd Howard kisses. And you get to inseminate Todd Howard's daughters. Glory kills are so great, they have to endlessly bribe you to use them! That's how you know they're great!

I'm surprised they don't give this game out for free, on the sole condition the user must perform a glory kill at least once for every minute played.

And I just now realized something. Remember how some of those doors are stuck and require DoomGuy to force it open, via a little first person animation? I've realized that animation is DoomGuy performing a glory kill on the door.

That's how much they love glory kills. You no longer open doors. [b]You glory kill them open![/b]

[h1]Wuts:[/h1]
What did they do to Pinky?? Look how they massacred my boy! He's invincible from the front? His only attack is a charge attack? Then you dodge and hit him from behind? Didn't that trope burn itself out around 2005? What is this shit??

Why did DoomGuy throw the monitor to the floor at the beginning? It was like the devs were agreeing unskippable story in games is boring, breaks flow, and gets in the way of all of the fun shooting. But then they put a long boring story right back in the game, anyways. So which is it, guys?

Why does everybody say the super shotgun is great? Yes, it plays a nice WAV file every time you mouse click, but what does it offer besides that? The spread and damage will always be underwhelming so long as this single player game feels like it has network lag and the enemies aren't taking damage. And the reload time is what seals its fate. I would much rather be using the rocket launcher, the railgun, the chaingun, the plasmagun, hell even the single barrel shotgun has a grenade launcher as the alt fire. What's the super shotgun's alt fire? Iron sights. [b]I r o n.   S i g h t s.[/b]

What's with the aesthetics of this game? Did nobody on the dev team have an objection to this? Everything is ugly, shiny, and moving. I can't tell if something is a demon or a coffee maker. I understand the idea is to make you feel like you're inside of a living, breathing world, something significantly bigger than yourself, like you're a single cell bacteria deep inside the writhing bowels of a komodo dragon. But it breaks the flow when I constantly have to stop and ponder if the haze of shiny brown pixels in the distance is something I need to shoot or not. [b]In short; don't make the enemies and the environment look the same.[/b]

Why is this game's install size so big? What could possibly be taking up that much space? It's not like there's a lot of variety to the levels. Every level in the game is a sciencey place, a sandy place, or a sciencey place with sand blowing into it. Is this an anti-piracy practice? If so, I guess it would work. Who would want to download 70gbs, only for it to not install properly, which would force them to find another 70gbs download? Which brings me to...

[h1]68.69 GB:[/h1]
Every time I see this game in my library, I breathe the weary sigh of the subjugated.

The only reason I have to play this is so I can finally beat it and consider myself done with it. Only then can I uninstall it from my NVMe once and for all, get my 70gbs of space back, and never have another reason to redownload it.

But now that's no longer enough.

The game is just SO boring. It's soul crushing. The combat is easily the best part and creates truly fun moments, and in those moments I can all too briefly only glimpse at what others see in this game. But there is too much space in between those moments. The game feels like a grind. It's a chore I must accomplish, not because I benefit from it, but only so I can consider the chore finished.

Now I don't even want to beat it. I wouldn't feel good, accomplished, or joyful. I would only breathe another weary sigh of the subjugated. It would be over, sure. But beating it wouldn't be a victory, it would be a release.

I understand Agent Smith now. He doesn't want to destroy the humans because he hates them. He wants to destroy them so he can finally not have a purpose and thus be freed from his own miserable existence. His being and goal mirrors their own; he is a slave and he wants to be free. With them out of the way, his suffering could finally end and he could at long last be mercifully deleted. The demons are my Morpheus.

But I differ from him in one way; I have a choice.

I choose to release myself. Uninstalled."

Too many long term players that only play this game and it ruins it for everyone. There is no anticheat so its a free for all as far as hacks. Who knows whats out there.
A positive review is not available in your region.
as a mother of 3 DONT let your kids play this game it is very violent and crude.

"Overwhelmingly bland gameplay, enemies barely react to hits, weapons feel like nerf guns.

Jumping and general movement doesn't feel fluid, but stiff and designed for consoles. Platforming is no fun at all.

Story is laughable even for doom

Music is 10/10 tho."
"DOOM Review 5/10/2022

To Hell and Back and Back Again

CONS -
It only took me less than 10 hours to beat single player mode. The last third was a wave after wave of the same thing. The guns they give you are fun, but half of them become worthless at the end of the game- meaning ammo is scarce for the weapons you do need. I played the game on ""Hurt me Plenty"" difficulty which I guess is the ""Normal"" setting. For sure the game was meant to be played on harder difficulties. Seems online mode is dead, and the matches i did get in (I just frankly suck) it felt like the gun balancing wasn't fair. I'd like to try the mode where you become a demon but I could never get into a lobby. (Maybe everyone is playing DOOM Eternal now). The games story is...basic? Does it need to be some masterpiece? No. But the whole premise is ""You shoot demons because they exist...and...thats it"". Of course there are background characters and lore within the game to collect. But none of that is front and center. Which means the player has less reason to care for ""Doom guy"" or the bad guys or even your few allies. Because they have very little depth. I want to know about the DOOM lore and worlds I'm travelling more. Especially when they put so much effort into the visuals and soundtrack of this game.

PROS-
(Spoilers)
YOU GET TO GO TO HELL AND BACK-  AND THEN BACK AGAIN!!! WHILE LISTENING TO METAL!!! And fight on Mars!!! How cool is that for a setting??? 
The saving grace of this game is its movement and runes (abilities). Charging across the map to rip open a demons head which in turn gave me health and armor encouraged me to rapidly charge right at their faces with the shotgun. The gore is fantastic and satisfying. I like how this game rewards you for exploring and there are very cool secret rooms which pay tribute to the original game's release back in the 90s. I can't say I loved the boss fights but they were pleasing to fight. On ""hurt me plenty"" it took a couple deaths but I finished the job. I would wanna replay the game on a harder difficulty to REALLY feel scared when they show up. 

SIDE NOTE: The Beserk powerup is fantastic, one punch-one kill on literally any minion is the best way to play DOOM.

Verdict-
6.5/10
DOOM is a sugar rush, a short one at that- but a delightful treat while you slay demons on the high. I found myself getting tired by the end of the single player. I wanted it to end. The sugar wore off and I was looking for another kick at the end to keep me going. I can't imagine how much time it took to design these levels and animate the monsters. But after the 10 hours of repeating soundtrack you start to see where they cut corners and just ""copy-pasted"" similar fights from other levels onto the last remaining arenas."
Progress blocking bug a couple of missions in. I died and when it reloaded it had a checkpoint that I had already progressed past and I am just unable to continue past it at all now.
B U G S
IT DOESNT LOAD  PROPERLY .
"Pretty game, but extremely repetitive. Too boring for me as it could not hold my interest."
"The gameplay is ok, but only for the reason that I had to use devmode and god mode to get pass a boss, the gamefile got corrupted, with no chance of recovery, so i had to start a new game. that made me just uninstall the game and rethink my earlier respect for ID."
"game runs like shit, i turned all the graphics down to nothing and have a good pc and i cant play at all, cyberpunk ran better than this"
i want my money and my time back
If you love trying to land jumps in a first-person shooter this is the game for you!
The lack of save game functionality outside of garbage console checkpoints really mars an otherwise fun experience.
boring as shit
I can't get over the mechanic of going into a full animation and killing an enemy.  As an older FPS player I find this terrible enough to not even bother playing through the game.  Game is just too boring!
corrupted my save file
"Edit: Marty Stratton, Bethesda, and Bethesda Legal are complicit in abusive, manipulative, and slanderous behavior against Mick Gordon, warranting a total boycott of ALL Bethesda titles from here on until this situation is rectified and Marty is out of a job.


Better than Doom Eternal in my opinion. Gauss Cannon Siege mode is the best videogame weapon, fight me."
not working
"Didn't finish the game, because the cutscenes are unskippable and dumb. Also, I was always low on ammo, no matter the difficulty mode."
"Too much violence such as blood and gore, I threw up playing this game. 0/10!"
0/10 not Quake 1.
"Quake 3 gameplay with juvenile violence and nothing interesting to add. I can remember playing Doom 3, and going around staring at walls in hell, to look at the art they'd done. The way the enemies moved was so creepy, and the increasingly visceral (literally) settings gave it all so much to get involved in. Even Doom (1993) had all sorts of lush art to look at, from the stretchy faces and tentacles, to the green marble and the Giger-esque end-of level doors. In contrast, I once backtracked an entire level of Doom (2016), finding every secret, because I didn't notice the end-of-level button. It's 20 hours of grey lumps."
"Horrible. After hours of troubleshooting trying to get the game to work using the lowest settings and capping the frame rate I got past the first mission once, and can't do anything again without freezing or crashing. Most of the time I can't even get into the main menu. I'm past the refund date or I would. I thought I'd enjoy this quite a bit given how much praise It's gotten, but I can't enjoy something I can't play.

(Finally gotten it to work after a lot more tinkering and it's amazing how badly optimized this is, several options need to be set perfectly like if the api should be OpenGL 4.5 or Vulkan and if you don't get it right then nothing works)(I know Bethesda only published it, and didn't code it, but it really has that Bethesda ""polish"")(Now that it's working perfectly fine and stable I gotta think about how good the game is and in short it's mostly good but it's not exactly revolutionary or anything. It's enjoyable and finding ""most"" of the secrets is good and feels rewarding.)"
"can not open the game
""the engine has crashed""

need help"
"Single player is fun but can get mentally taxing after a while.

Multiplayer is very meh and feels unnecessary.

Not fond of the spastic twitch shooter trend these last 2 DOOM titles are going down.

Prefer older titles using GZDoom/Zandronum source ports for better multiplayer modes and mods.

Badass soundtrack though!"
Not for someone that doesn't like long boring firefights.
sorry this game diarrhea
"cant figure way forward, few hours running to walls and deleting forever 0/5"
not fun
"Looks better than it feels.
Maby if you played all games before and have some nostalgy about it bur for a newby its just a plane run and jump simulator with no catching Storry or anything i hoed for,"
"This game was a boring ass slog. Tedious gameplay, slow as shit movement options

Took me a year to finish this damn game on and off because of how much of a snoozefest it was

Don't buy this."
"Price I paid: $5

I really wanted to like this game, but it's just not satisfying to me.

In the original DOOM, you could turn imps and zombies into dog food with one satisfying shotgun blast from 20 feet away, followed by that equally satisfying pump-action sound effect. It's gameplay that stands the test of time and never gets old!

Now you gotta get point-blank if you want to kill the weakest enemies with a single shotgun blast and you don't even want to do that! - what you're supposed to do is stun them (so be close, but not too close) then while they're staggered you ""glory kill"" (hit F to initiate a fancy fatality animation) the monsters. It's fun for like 2 minutes, then it just becomes redundant.

On top of that, there are RPG mechanics that I really don't like. Throughout the levels, you find little robots that upgrade your gear. I ended up with a shotgun that can shoot grenades... which is dumb! Why not give me a grenade/rocket launcher like in Quake instead? I suppose it would have been worse if I missed the upgrade entirely! Imagine a shooter where you could miss half your arsenal? Doesn't seem fun or smart, if you ask me.

Worse than having to perform fatalities every 5 seconds to get my health back are the cutscenes and the dialogue. I. Do. Not. Care! I just want to run around and blast zombies. Oh, and speaking of just running around, why does my guy have to rip every door open like he's the hulk? Save me 10 seconds and just have the doors open up and let me walk through them - it's not cool or fun, it's just repetitive!

Complaints aside, the graphics are great and the action is smooth - albeit kinda boring. I feel like they were trying too hard to be edgy and innovative. 

TLDR: Worth the $5 but it's just ""meh."" I suggest getting BRUTAL DOOM instead - which is way more fun and free!"
This has more in common with mario than Doom 1/2/64. This is NOT Doom. The Doom series is truly dead. This is closer to Mario than Doom since you play as Sir hopsalot instead of focusing on the shooting.
Eh.  Pretty mediocre.
BUGGY
"Great graphics and sound, but the game severely outstays its welcome and becomes a fucking bore halfway through. No one wants to fight the same lame bullet sponge enemies over and over again."
#GAMES OUT OF POLITICS!!!!!
i hate doom sooooo much
"I'm too impatient to search my way through the levels of the campaign. I feel like Dora the Explorer 90% of the time, alternated with 10% John Wick. 
Personal preference though, otherwise the game runs very well and the combat is great ^^"
f this game
"I played most Doom older games for fun. Until Doom 3, I found it not appealing to me. Now with this, the same thing happened!

I started the game and got afraid of dying, frustrated from dying, I went into rage, then I started hunting the fucking demons of hell. It never stops! My adrenaline is high, I can't sleep at night because I feel like I have to play and kill some fucking demons. I never had a grudge on such game monsters before. I am only quitting now because it started to affect my health.

If you like a game where you go and KILL SOME DEMONS, YOU WILL ENJOY THIS SHIT!!

Too bad, I can't recommend it. I wish I could go back and play Gears of War for the first time again instead of this."
i was in the dark it was so dark i cant see
"I love this game, it was a real blast. Everything was awesome, guns, gamplay, music, etc. Right until my save game corrupted and I lost my near complete save game. Absolute bullshit."
meh
It's a boring and shallow shooter.
just meh
R.I.P Multiplayer
"I've been playing this for 3 hrs, I've run into a game breaking bug, every time I screen shot everything goes black, my screen becomes pitch black. There were times were when I continue my game on the last checkpoint the game spawns me in an area that is no longer part of the area that I am suppose to be in, and the gates to get to the area im supposed to be on does not open because it thinks I am still in that area despite not being there. I hope this gets fixed soon (Which is unlikely).

Game Crashed and corrupted the save file."
"This game is overwhelmingly loved by many and I absolutely understand why.  It's intense, fast-paced, hardhitting, plays amazing, and is spectacular.

For me, it's so fast paced and chaotic thaqt I found myself not strategizing or playing smart and instead running and gunning without thought.  Many people enjoy that gameplay but for me I prefer to outsmart my enemies.

If you think you'd like reckless abandon and running and gunning, you will like this game."
"Do you know that one badas scene from the intro where 2016 doom guy shows off his attitude?
Yea the game is the exact opposite of that. I got this around christmas 2021 at ~5 bucks and it still feels like wasted money.

Everything is designed around you doing exactly what the designers thought of, gauntlet after gauntlet, level after level, and its at best as good as the quality of the ideas and their execution which drops very fast after the initial level. Interested in coming up with your own strategies or wanting to experiment? Better try a different game from a different developer. I suggest one thats is not in the grasp of Zenimax and a mob of bethesda companies. Reading the credits for this hints at a rather bizarre production history as a small army scattered over half the globe seems to have worked on this product with what reads like hundreds of producers and managers ..
Where all that work went is a mystery to me whereas the environmental art deserves praise in many instances.

I also have to wonder how one can look at a franchise like Doom and think it wise to ""enrich"" the once working concept with mediocre storytelling, especially when that story seems to take itself way too serious and isnt well written on any level.

Last but not least there is the anti cheat story one can read about in many other reviews - trash behaviour of people that seem to consider their audience helpless clueless fools. How that did not have more serious consequences is a mystery to me.

rip ID software,
please go away zenimax,
back to indie games."
"I cannot recommend this game at all, too late for a refund soo might as well finish but here's why I hate it, the controls are terrible like the doom guy walks around like he's holding in a shit he even jumps like that too, the music gets really annoying and the tune trails make no sense, sometimes you get a good weapon other times a shitty one, I got this on offer and I'm glad cause full price for game with a lot flaws yeah no, will be avoiding ID and doom which when you think about it ID is like short for idiots soo yeah idiots made this game"
"The game is great during the 5% of time it actually works. My computer is more than good enough to run it based on the specs listed, but this game still crashes every hour or so, and my save file has been lost more times than I can count in only 15 hours of gameplay. I'd love to be able to complete this game, but I'm stuck replaying the first few levels because of how buggy and easy to lose it is. Could have been great."
"if I wanted to (double) hop like a rabbit I would just play Jazz jackrabbit.
Too much hopping, too much wannabe cinematic nonsense and a really annoying enemy in the shape of the Hell Guard.

That fight was stupid as is the boss.

Also, Steam, why the hell does the game break when I enable dev mode and the steam client is working?
I don't care about stupid nonsense like achievements, I am here to unwind, and all this nonsense is just annoying me, the game screams the save is corrupted, but Steam offline works just fine.

This is shit!"
"This game started out strong. Very strong. Then by level 5 I was just speed running and didn't a fuck about all of the extra secrets and collectables which were a cheap way of ensuring that they got you playing for more hours. Endless hordes of the same 6 boring enemies, with only ONE weapon that is actually effective (super shotgun). In summary, the game has really good mechanics that are reminiscent of the classic DOOM games. But the game falls short in terms of longevity. It gets very boring and by the end of it you just want to get the bloody thing over with."
Never ever play this after DOOM Eternal or you will keep dying because of your own grenade or falling into holes during combat
Lack of movement makes this game not feel as enjoyable as it could be.
this is the game your annoying cousin tells you to play because its so epic and not corrupted by those ess jay double yous. you shoot some demons and some of the demons require more bullets to kill than the other demons. your cousin only listens to rock music and thinks the soundtrack is a masterwork by god himself. strip back all the hype around this game and its a repetitive shooter with some good visual design that you can safely skip and not feel bad about in the slightest.
constantly pulls you out of the action for some boring story.
"Litterally unplayable, unfinishable eveen."
it gets stuck at 99 percent and wont load
"Unstable game, constant random crashes, not playable.  Have encountered the issues on both Intel and AMD based systems with GTX 3060 or RX 6600 GPU's. Windows or Linux, same problems.  Had crashing issues on my old Dell XPS with a GTX 1050 over a year ago.  Got new systems and same issues. 

Strongly do not recommend this game due to lack of usable updates that can resolve the constant crashing issues."
"Hero is too fragile.
The mission objectives and waypoints are not indicated on the maps.
Will finish and uninstall forever."
"I can't go back to this after playing Eternal. Not a bad game, but a hard sell compared to its sequel."
More like Dumb
surprisingly boring

"Could had been a good game on past, but all my played time was spent trying to start the dam thing, no matter how much Launch options I set up (+ r_renderAPI -1, 0 or even 1), set both .exe for win 7 and admin, got VCs x64 and 32 updated, installed Vulkan on purpose, and stil no sucess, forum is full with ppl on same issues, even the dev ""solution"" is wrongly typed, this is pointless"
"It's a good game, but as an old-school Doom (1993) player, I don't think it's for me:

- Instead of always moving forwards, you are locked into small arenas where enemies constantly spawn, until some unknown threshold is reached.
- ""Glory kills"" are excessively gory."
"Someone's mediocre idea for an original FPS, shoehorned into doom, possibly the single least appropriate franchise vehicle for it imaginable. Who remembers Doom, kids? The game where you do loads of melee animations and have to be careful not to shoot too much or hurt any of the enemies too bad? That's the one.

Before: ripping through maps at lightning speed
Now: loads of samey sealed off kill rooms 
Before: lots of contextual audio clues for enemies, all of which are distinct behaviourally and can be easily provoked to shoot each other for more mayhem
Now: pretty much everything warps in immediately around you with zero announcement, pretty much anything that shoots does so at low volume, pretty fast speed and pretty accurately
Before: shooting enemies dead to emphasise multi-kills and prioritising groups, enemy HP, range, etc, using the appropriate weapon
Now: shooting enemies dead deprives you of i-frames and HP, and you're constantly locked in tiny rooms with no range shooting possible

The combination of constantly being sealed off in a tiny room with teleporting enemies, and being punished for overkilling/exceeding HP limits by losing your i-frame executions and HP, means the game is basically a series of start-stops, punctuated by even more annoying canned mini stops for executions. The pace of the game is basically that of the equally mediocre Doom 3, without any of the more interesting tools the expansion pack added. 

Genuinely, incredibly suspicious of the tastes of anyone who rates this as good."
Not Enough Gore/Violence 10/10
i just wanna kill demons and not search the map for 4 different kind of collectibles (3 of which influence gameplay)
It is annoying that the only way to disable this constant irritating prompt is to actually review the game. So I will: IT SUCKS!
the saved game protection sucks
i cant play the game
Trash
doom is not boom
"I had to reset two different levels in an advanced stage and I'm not even sure if they bugged out or the level design was just terrible. Anyway, if I wanted to be stuck by bullshit, I would replay the Ocarina of Time water temple. Fuck it."
"Doom sucks 
1 Weapons suck on here there similar to the ones on Destiny 2 but worse on Doom then they are on Destiny 2
2 The fighting style on here sucks it's not worth the time. I would rather play Destiny 2 over Doom any time.
3 Doom is a waste of money on this game as well.

Doom is not a game I play as my very first Fps game. I would suggest Destiny 2 or halo or other fps games as your First Fps game instead of Doom. Each mission one by one is slower then what other Fps games and Destiny 2 are.
Destiny 2 may seem slower just cause they are longer, They are Definitely not as slow a paste per mission as missions on Doom.

Weapons on here suck really bad and they don't shoot that well either They fire as slow as they can possible go on Doom. You also don't get ammo for them as easily, They also don't look as cool either and you don't get a big verity on witch ones you want to keep and use at a time. On Doom you get certain ones and stuck with them that sounds horrible If your a Destiny 2 fan Like halo has the same thing but the only Difference with it in Halo from Doom is you get to pick up new weapons on Halo and some times repeats, In Doom you don't even get to do that and put shaders on any of your weapons like customize them and make them look cooler same with halo.

After checking out and playing doom over time periods and now to find out it's a slow game and not very fun is not a very good game. I get that each Fps game has there own style and versions of each game that they like to do but some seem like they are worse then others and it happens some times. 

Doom is a paid similar version of destiny 2 with just missions, blood gore graphics, horror.
Now if you enjoy horror games then you might not find this game so terrible cause of Doom having horror related content.
I have played this game a bunch my self never really paid attention to certain parts of the game but now in days the more games I play and just went back to trying it out today and thinking about playing this I was like nope.
I also got into this game cause I was trying to want to handle horror did not bother me at all till I got use to it way back in the day but now in days that I been playing certain Fps games more I am more aware of content in games as far as horror and not horror in Fps games Depending on what the game is.

Doom is definitely not a Faster paste it's more of a slower fps game with combat the only part that is fast about this game is how quickly your player moves other wise it's like as slow as combat can go on here.
Doom is also not worth $20.00 for this game, Some were around $5-10 in that price range is more worth it for any of the newer Doom Games out there on Steam. 

I would suggest If your a destiny 2 fan avoid this game unless you like Horror related content in Video games and including fps games But I am personally would not play this game any more cause I don't like horror content in video games and Doom Sucks as a Fps game as well.
I also would suggest not spending money on Doom as well not even worth 1 cent so just save the money unless you are a horror fan.

Now if your not A Destiny 2 Fan you might enjoy this game cause your not use to the Content paste of Destiny 2 one dlc at a time and doing the grinding for loot. 
There is a lot more to do on Destiny 2 then Doom as far as I know from playing Doom from the time I played the game and Playing Destiny 2 Doom is not gonna be no were as much fun as Destiny 2 and other fps games that for sure in my opinion.

This game is just more the Blood and Gore fans who are looking for something similar to Destiny 2 but with more Blood Gore and horror related content added to it. So if you like that then this game is for you if not I would not suggest it once."
It's kinda boring.
does not work properly crashes every 10-15 mins into the game
"Awful checkpoint only save system that merely exists to pad game length; menu system that's designed to be used with controller; adopts worst part of original Doom, running around in circles on a map looking for keycards; freezes frequently. Terrible game all around."
"I just got stuck, not knowing where to go, trapped in a furnace type place. Not enough help given showing you where to go. Frustrated. Yes I'm not a very good player but that's not the point."
"Boring, completely uncaptivating story if there's any. Basically just attracts Gore and obnouxious music players.
Even for 5 dollars, very regretful purchase."
Activating console disables saves. I am a grown ass adult with no time for the intended method of play. This is rude. I care not about achievements. Just want to play through the campaign in a reasonably fast pace. Simple as that. I don't care about cheat haters. They do not work enough to judge me.
I piss and shit and cum my pant
"I played this game to the end once. 
So. I like the idea of a mindless shooter with a linear map and with skipable story and uncomplainable graphics.
To my flavor, there could be fewer weapons and straighter explanations what to kill with what. That's because this was my first doom, and only after I played the Eternal, which gives clear instructions in weak points and weapon weaknesses of monsters. (the Eternal had another bug, namely that shadow maps are many individual dots (which looks horrible)).

On second play-on, the bummer for me was the very bad map. I simply often don't know where the fork I have to go. And that gets pretty annoying because 1) every room looks roughly the same; I mean, the game is supposed to be that way because there is no story and hence the room where something happens is irrelevant. 2) Games like these are played for the purpose of being relieved of thinking for the time playing.

The issue with the map is that it is 3D and there are many storeys. You have to rotate the map and it does not show you doors nor does it indicate where you have to go. After several back and forth and serching in certain ""levels"" and then going to youtube and searching trough various videos where the point would be where they make progress from the point that I am at, I just entirely lost the fun.

I wish it had just be a game where you have like 3 to 4 guns and bash through enemies with a lot of blood and splatter. But that is not the case because of the confusing map and because of the complicated enemy mechanics (weapon resistency, weak points, etc)."
"basically a game for idiots. literally all u do is kill people. hello? 2003 wants their killing game back? nowadays games should have more of a reason for all the senseless killing. doom-man should break into tears every time a demon's life is extinguished by his bloodied hands.

instead of this game you should play ""Shenmue 3"". the follow up to the critically acclaimed ""Shenmue 2""."
hate it
I PLAYED BEFORE DOOM ETERNAL AND I VERY LIKED THIS GAME AND I FINISH THE CAMPIAGN 2 TIMES AND THAT'S MAKE THIS GAME MORE BORING LITRELI
"I waited many years to play this one, and my expectations were admittedly high. Sadly, they were not met, at all. The game is much slower than expected, the level design is a mess, and consists of finding your way to the next ""arena"" by using an unclear map and a destination pointer. When you find it, you're locked in until everything is dead. Then repeat, forever. While the music is amazing, it's often not there at all, and the sound design was a huge miss for me. The first 4 weapons all felt underwhelming, even after a few upgrades.

The ""glory kill"" system was always presented as non intrusive and ""flowing perfectly"" with the combat, but that also never really worked as expected, it creates so many unnecessary pauses, and sometimes break the flow of combat by making you unsure about where your character is actually positioned.

Also, the title screen still shows advertising to preorder stuff released 2 years ago. The overall menus were a bit of a mess too, took some time just to find where the settings were, and then even longer to find out how to set resolution to ultrawide. I'd expect games to detect and set that automatically nowadays instead of making you waste a long time in menus just to set the game resolution to match your monitor."
"This game is super boring compared to doom eternal. 
The level design is pretty terrible with it's massive ass 20 stories facilities where if you want to explore or even want to go to the objective you will get lost lots of times since the layouts are very shit and the radar doesn't properly show where you have to go. 
This is especially shit when you have just killed lots of demons, you are excited to run super quickly to another location and continue the massacre, but instead you just get this massive tempo slowdown which is pretty detrimental to the overall fun aspect.

Verdict: Buy doom eternal instead!"
there's a rocket launcher in the game but you can't rocket jump so overall 0/10 unplayable
Dont know how you feck up this game but they did.................
STUPID GAY DUMB SHITTY RIPOFF OF HALO THIS GAME IS FOR BABYHEADS WITH THEIR GAY LITTLE MONSTERHEADS MASTERBATING CHEF COULD BEATUP THIS HALO WANABES ASS ANYDAY >:DDDDD DOOMS FOR VIRIGIN IDIETHEADS HAHAHAHA
6/10.
its not as good as doom eternal
"Game crashes constantly without errors, doesn't matter what I change in the settings, it's just unplayable for me."
fix the save thing
"poop - no co-op, multiplayer is down 90+% of the time.  just don't even..."
"I wanted to return and play it, but the the game is broken due to updates? Until they fix the game I leave negative comment that other ppl be aware."
If you like scary games this one is for you. Unless you like being scared to death I would give it a miss.
"I'm trying to say something nice about this sequel of a classic.

but it's very slow compared to the original.
the graphics are very good, but there seems to be nothing truly horrifying here, just repetitive slaying of monster tryhards.

it's just not worthy of the title ""doom"" if it doesn't portray that feeling one bit.

goodbye gordon (minigame) is scarier than this. sorry id"
"Dont tag the shit as co-op if its not.

0/11"
I JUST HATE IT ive beat it twice on ps4 and played so much i dont know why i hatew it so much the seacrits are manditory you need a walkthourugh its worse than final fantasy and the game is so jank and unsatifying but i played it for 40 hours and so i guess it did somthing right
bit overated gets rlly repetative only played 45 mins of the game and started getting bored probably going to refund
"I bought the game.
Got 4 hours of gameplay out of it...
Tried to start it up today for an evening demon slaying session and the game refused to load (Not Responding in Task Manager). The DOOM Console talked about some dev_mode and ""unverified resources in the game files""

At least I got it on sale so I'm not out a lot of money..."
boring game
Really want doom eternal soundtrack on spotify.
Boring.
"the game is not bad in itself, it's just unfinished and boring. There are few enemies, and they are not very dangerous. The game begins to be played only towards the end."
"It was good when it came out, but the level design is abysmal mazes of backtracking"
Too many puzzle and story elements... I just wanna shoot some dudes and rip some apart :/
"A good game, tho runs shit with AMD... Vulkan makes it bearable, but still experience some crashes"
"Save game corrupt and apparently thats a thing in the doom forums (just google it) , its effecting everyone, its also effecting doom eternal.have to play back from the start but whose to say this wont happen again , so cant recommend for now and will be skipping doom eternal as well. Why would a save game have so many files ? and no restoring from steam cloud save game didnt work either. you can download someone else save game but it will be in dev mode and achievements will be locked. the campaign can be finished in 9 hours or less."
"Graphics are great, but it's meh at best if you ask me. And yes I come from Doom 95 days, lol. This is just not for me I guess."
"not bad i guess,  nothing fantastic; but running around looking for keys with the shitty map system and no waypoint markers is an exercise in frustration"
"The game crashed, the save file then corrupted and I can't access my save file anymore. Actual bullshit. There's a steam cloud for this exact reason. The game was fun, but this sucks."
"Don't play this if you have already played eternal, its a stuttery un-optimised piece of shit. The game play and story is good but the constant lag spikes are unbearable"
trash
"The game was good and different from the usual fps games i played for about 3 hours. After that i almost got sick of this repetition.

Its the same thing and it never ends. I played for 9 hours now. Not even close to finish it. 
If it was like 5 hours long i would've definitely putted a thumbs up. But it just got super boring. I can't stand it anymore."
audio doesnt work
I doesn't have an easy enough setting. I got half way through and then got stuck at one of the bosses.  I couldn't finish the game. That totally sucked.
"I finally got around to playing this game after buying some Collector's Edition with the Revenant Statue. Despite the Revenant Statue itself having been in poor quality (was quite literally broken when I got it), I enjoyed the game's campaign greatly. I am very saddened that I'll never be able to 100% the game however as I absolutely hate and avoid multiplayer in shooter games like this and thus will never get the achievements outside the single-player campaign. I honestly wish games like this would stop putting in multiplayer achievements but sadly that seems to be a pipe dream as clearly game companies don't care when it comes down to it.

Would I recommend this game? Honestly no, because it'll forever bother me that I can't 100% the game. However if you enjoy multiplayer, then have at it, I won't stop you."
Game just plain sucks!!!! Major snooze fest. dont waste your money. One of the worse remakes ever played
I couldnt start the game. crashed before i can even see the main menu
"It's like EVERYBODY claims that if u r looking for an EXCITING shooter game, then DOOM it is.
Well, thb, I quit the game after like 2 hrs. The game is just not what I expected it to be.
Firstly, I gotta run around the maps to find these goddamned ammo so that I can shoot a 20-shots-capped-reload-free-shotgun.
Secondly, the HUD and guiding system suck! I had to spend the most time finding the path to the next interactive point AND it was under the circumstance of all those soooo well-hidden key items collected.
Finally, I kept the precious 3 grenades from the beginning to the end coz tutorial never showed which button it was.
No offense but this shit is not for me."
no
Ништа специјално. И даље мислим да су бољи претходни делови.
There's a glitch making the mouse fly all over the place making this game unplayable.
"Started haven't got around to finishing it, the gameplays ok!"
Starts fun but holding D and left click gets boring after a little while
"Can't really go for something that doesn't allow turning off aim assist.  I can't shoot around shields, because they didn't want me to have the option?  I was going to write that Todd Howard was nowhere to be seen in this game, but there he is after all.  I've died more times to the security shield guys than to anybody else, because my brain can't accept the fact that I can't shoot where I want to.

You get better value out of Wolfenstein (the 2 good ones) and Dead Space."
im slaying heretics in doom
poop and shit until you cum
Often mind-bogglingly boring as you try to find the hidden door for an hour or two. I have given upon this game several times because of this.
Double the movement speed and maybe I'll like it
"I just dont like it, while i enjoyed the old Doom in the 90s; this just sucks. 
Boomer shooters and scifi just dont work in modern graphics and mechanics for me. 
Extremely overrated."
I can't play this game normally as the game is freezing on main page while loading(((
"the difficulty mode is the worst part, first time playthu normal is too easy on hard it's BS, thanks to the checkpoint that make you go though the same mob, they either hit too hard or take too much damage. 
what's wrong with a manual save? 
didn't think I would like this game thu, nothing really new and excited at this point.
it's NOT a must play, I mean you kite large dude around and GK imps, that's the game play
also input every direction move so the AI can't hit you."
"was immediately bored to death by this game. the opening cut scene was cool, and then it was all downhill from there. too many scripted events, glory kills make it too easy, and it's not nearly fast paced enough. there's way too much space between enemies. and a pistol with infinite ammo? yikes. i guess it might be an OK game, but it's a trash doom game."

"DOOM is a ""reboot"" of the original id Software DooM from 1993, the game that made FPS the institution it is today, being the first multiplayer FPS game, and a few other industry firsts as well.  2016's DOOM is as much a follow on from DOOM 3 as it is a reboot of the franchise.    This edition of the game is a solid, story driven, gory, horror themed FPS with light platforming elements.

Many things have been done exceedingly well here.   The graphics are immaculate, the game is highly polished.  FPS action is tight, immersive and engaging.   The game features numerous progression areas including upgrading your weapons, armour, core stats, and special bonuses from ""Runes"", which are difficult skill challenges.   The game is full of hidden areas, secrets and unlocks to find.  For 2016 it can be argued this was the best of breed action FPS. 

I'd like to be able to recommend this, I really would.  But there's some problems that have impacted a few players to the point they gave up on the game (indeed, only about 1/3rd of people who own the game bothered to finish it).   It's something id/Bethesda know about but haven't bothered to fix.   For myself, and for many other players (just read the discussions and internet forums about the problem!) the game freezes up momentarily.  Not once or twice, mind you... every 8 seconds.   The game pauses for about 0.5 to 1 second.  This might not seem like a lot, but it's enough to make you pull your hair out.  It's like water torture.  You'll die to enemies, you'll miss making a jump, all because that 8 second timer comes around and freezes you right when you're in the middle of the action.  Over, and over, and over again. 

I've tried everything to fix it.  Switching between OpenGL and Vulkan, disabling Razer Chroma, every single graphics tweak there is, different graphics drivers, re-installing the game completely, wiping profiles and shader caches... there's simply no user-side fix to the problem.   id's Tech engines are considered the best in the industry, so it's bewildering and disappointing that they shipped the game with such serious glitches, and worse that they never bothered to fix them. 
 
Maybe you won't suffer the same problems, maybe the game will be perfect for you.  It wasn't for me, it wasn't for others, and because of that, I just can't tell people to buy this game."
doomguy isnt thicc and its halo
It's boring for me. Not my type of game.
"Cool, but unplayable, too many crashes, audio lags, fps drops, and blackscreens

i really wanted to play this, but, you know, Bethesda happens"
"Just meh, don't even know if its worth $5"
"Unplayable trash. The audio mixing is so bad that it makes the game unplayable--if you disagree, it's because you play the game for the soundtrack, try turning it off, whoever did the technical audio on this game (and DOOM Eternal, which has the same issues) should be fired and never work in the industry again.

P.S.
Upon further consideration, I think the proper punishment for whoever did the sound mixing is to be forced to work on EA mobile games for eternity."
"Disclaimer: This review is written after my first ever playthrough of Doom 2016, and obviously I was playing on Ultra-Violence, because I played Doom 1 & 2, Ultimate Doom and Plutonia Experiment on Ultra-Violence.
[hr][/hr]
[h1]What I liked[/h1]
[b][u]Increased mobility[/u][/b]. I am a Quake Live veteran and I absolutely love when a shooter game is [i]fast[/i] and requires you to pay attention to surroundings, and Doom 2016 delivers here. The shootouts reminded me of Quake Live multiplayer fights, and I really liked that enemies are not just rushing mindlessly at you, but actually try to surround you and approach you from unexpected directions. 
[b][u]Agile monsters[/u][/b]. Comparing to enemies in the original two Dooms, Doom 2016 monsters are really agile. They will jump, run, take cover and sometimes it was really tough to break their line of fire while dealing with multiple threats at the same time.
[b][u]Better weapons[/u][/b]. Doom 1 & 2 weapons were kind of silly as some were clearly better than others. You almost never used the Pistol, regular Shotgun and Chainsaw (maybe for lulz), because Super Shotgun and Rocket Launcher can deal with 98% of the threats. Chaingun and Plasmagun were occasionally useful, but mostly only when you didn't have enough rockets/shells, and for Plasmagun specifically, you wanted to keep the cells for shooting BFG. Here I found myself using a fully upgraded Pistol quite often, and addons like Stun Bombs and Cluster Strike can turn a mediocre weapon into a really great one. Some addons are more useful than others, but it's cool that you can adapt these to your playstyle.

[h1]What I did NOT like[/h1]
[b][u]Glory Kills (GK)[/u][/b] I am a very straightforward person, so I will start with the biggest offender. A lot of people will be surprised by this, but I find this mechanic to be an absolutely unnecessary gimmick. This game sends [i]waves[/i] of enemies at you which are really smart and try to surround you, and the last thing you want to do is get close and personal with them, and you especially do not want to be locked in an unskippable animation. The fact that some enemies [i]can not[/i] be killed other than via GKs (more on this later) was the first major red flag for me. I would feel completely fine about GKs if they weren't pushed down your throat at every possible occasion. Weapon upgrade points are often locked behind a ""kill a specific enemy via specific GK X times"" rtial which ends up being really frustrating as it's quite difficult to control which GK you are performing, especially in the middle of a fight. I also don't really understand what replenishing health, armour and ammo has to do with mutilating enemies with your bare fists and why regular kills can't accomplish that too, and I especially don't get how a Chainsaw turns even the weakest Possessed into walking ammo crates.
[b][u]Lack of continuity[/u][/b] Level design in Doom 1 & 2 wasn't the best, but if anything, it usually had a sense of fluidity in it. You started a level with enemies all over the map, and wherever you went, someone was waiting for you, and often in large numbers. In Doom 2016 you can walk around the map aimlessly until you reach a trigger point, a minor encounter ensues, you promptly finish that and then everything is calm again. The same happens when you enter a room with a Gore Nest.. *[i]sigh*.[/i] Every time I approached one, I knew I had to endure yet another ""suddenly all the exits are blocked until you deal with the monsters [i]here[/i]"" encounter. The game kinda tries to convey that it's because of a sudden demonic infestation in the area.. I beg your pardon, but did you pay any attention to what's happening around the facility, or these piles of gore, mutilated bodies and occult symbols smeared with blood all over the complex are part of your everyday R&D activity? These ""lockdowns"" start to get old really fast and this breaks the immersion. Speaking of lockdowns, I was playing this game in 2021, which is somewhat amusing.
[b][u]Music[/u][/b] Yes, music. It absolutely rocks when you do get to hear it, but you only hear it during fights. When you are not fighting, there are only ambient noises and monster sounds to entertain you, so it kinda overlaps with the previous point. Both Doom 1 & 2 had music that was playing continuously and never let you go. There were some really eerie tracks like [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cixW6rogZ48&t=5088s]Shawn's Got the Shotgun[/url] or [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cixW6rogZ48&t=5920s]The Demon's Dead[/url] which kept you on the edge at all times. I miss that kind of continuous accompaniment.
[b][u]Bosses[/u][/b] ""Boss Health Bar"" setting was the second major red flag that something might be seriously wrong with this game. Why there are bosses in a shooter game? Why all of the ""boss fights"" happen in stupid flat arenas with no cover where you have to dodge, jump and run around from telegraphed attacks like it's a bloody Dark Souls clone? And finally, why, just why of all mechanics you chose those bloody Glory Kills to be the [i]ONLY[/i] way to kill the boss once and for all?
[b][u]Badass Hero is Badass[/u][/b] First of all, the name [i]Doom Slayer[/i] sounds like a creative product of an 8-year old human male. Second, when I first heard that ""[i]RIP AND TEAR[/i]"", I chuckled, because it sounded really silly (look up Doom comics if you don't know what I am talking about), but then they doubled down and went full on with that silly premise and literally made the protagonist into a full-blown r/iamverybadass representation, which you can see from the way he interacts with the story and all the GKs. I am [i]very[/i] confused.
[b][u]BAD Auto-save[/u][/b] I don't mind having no save option and I can endure the game automatically saving at weird moments (saving right in front of the Cyberdemon really hit the nerve for me), but why can't I load the game from a previous checkpoint? I don't want to restart a level when I suddenly understand that I missed a secret or finished a big fight with 20 HP before. Why limit this option?
[b][u]Unskippable animations[/u][/b] New enemies appearing for the first time. New guns being picked up for the first time. Bosses. Cutscenes. Taking Praetor Suit upgrade tokens. Keys. Why do I need to sit through all of this every time, especially when I reset the game from checkpoint?

[h1]Final conclusion[/h1]
I quit the game after I completed the Cyberdemon ""boss fight"" (again, on Ultra-Violence, and again, this was my first ever attempt at playing the game) and decided that I don't want to put myself through this very frustrating experience any further. I like shooters which force you to think and use environment in creative ways, but these locked-down arenas, forced mechanics and [i]badassness[/i] turned my gameplay from ""this new Doom game seems fun!"" down to ""oh.. it's [i]that thing[/i] again.. when will this finally end.."". In terms of difficulty, I wouldn't say that the game feels really difficult on Ultra-Violence. It feels frustrating and maybe even a bit easy, because you don't experience constant action -- it's very sporadic and pocketed, and I am really saddened by the fact that level designers chose to force the player to fight into locked arenas instead of making the demonic infestation really palpable by properly populating the levels with demons.

5/10"
FUCKING SECRET PASSAGE IS RUINING THE FUN SO MUCH AND TOO MUCH! DOOM SUPPOSE TO BE SHOOTING AND KILLING AND FUCKING KILL ALL OF THEM NOT SPEND AN HOURS LOOKING FOR SECRET SHIT TO UPGRADE UR WEAPON. I REFUND THIS SHIT!
"I cannot recommend Doom. I've tried and I've given the game the benefit of the doubt, but at the end of the day, it's not good. 

Firstly, I'll start with the positives: The game had so much potential. A frantic FPS from ID, that's unlike most of the FPS games that have come out in the last century. 

So, what's wrong with the game? The biggest and most inherent issue and why I don't recommend the game is that it's unbalanced. Enemy difficulty goes between 2 extremes (too easy and too hard) and there is never a middle ground. 

Some enemies feel like they are designed to be a waste of time. Summoners. for example, are both difficult to deal with and to shoot at, and don't add much variety to the game. 

I don't think Doom is balanced. Death, after death, I try to understand what is going wrong. I go away and come back and continuously fail. Even after I kill a swarm of enemies, it is not followed with a sense of accomplishment.

2/5."
The fast movement throws me off.
Didn't see Margret Thatcher.
I found one of the secret classic level areas. I was having so much fun with it that I decided to go and play that game instead
l couldn't get into it
"This is bad, much worse than original Dooms or Doom 3. Not at any point did I feel like what was happening was realistic or engaging. Shame on you, ID!"
Go play Doom Eternal instead
"I'll write a lengthy one later, but essentially this is all the worst bits of Halo wearing Quake 4 skin on its face, that was painted in DooM 3 colours.

Fucking parkour and QTE, checkpoints in a classic twitch fps game? Are you kidding me? RPG-ish weapon ""upgrades"" in an iconic shooter?

The reason for positive reviews is probably memes or newb players, who can't tell a masterpiece FPS from a mediocre title, or people who grew up on Sanec, TF2 and Halo (God forbid).

Souless, grindy Painkiller clone, with ""Of course I'm using a gamepad to play FPS, why do you ask? Do I have a Nintendo Switch? Of course I do!"" soy undertones.

Every area has tons of secrets, which I am not interested in, but get this.... you armour can have an upgrade that makes your compass ""glow"" if there is a secret nearby, defeating the whole purpose.

Monotone, headache-inducing fucking soundtrack, that sounds mostly like a guy banging his musical instruments and his head against a wall in a violent fit. 

Weapons look like giant boxes with triggers on them -- they're absolutely the same. Be it ""assault rifle"" or ""rocket launcher"", your guy is running around with a FedEx box that fires coloured balls of things...

Enemies are a generic set of high-tech shit and bits of demon flesh. Whether you play this, or Quake 4, or whatever other modern shooter with ""monsters"" -- you can't tell the difference. They all just rush you, some scale walls, some strafe, but that's about it. There are also monsters that shift to other ends of the level and open portals, so you get the infinite enemies bullshit that is seen on nightmare difficulty in older games. Whoever thought this was a good idea needs to have been executed Imp-style -- their hands ripped off and then beaten to death with their own severed appendages.

Now gameplay is just that -- shooting areas of dumb monsters, which gets tedious after the first level. Jesus Christ, even in DOOM II they've wandered away from you at times, whilst here they just rush at you head on.

Story is shoved in your face through endless monologues by NPCs, it feels like you're playing a movie, not a game. Swathes of text walls, meaningless. This thing would be better off without a plot, than with what they have here.

The level design is utter cow manure: endless generic sci-fi corridors, and ""hell"" is like someone threw a mixture of glowsticks and lasagna in your face.

Digusting to even claim this has anything to do with DooM. Classic Bethesda.

Just play Dusk."
"Too many hidden/secret areas.
I want to shoot demons not search for toys."
I want to shoot demons but I spend 80% of the time walking around trying to get to the marker.
"I like how they tried to make something faithful to the original, but found it got pretty monotonous after a bit.  I'm not a fan of the ""glory kill"" mechanism as it really deflates any sort of tactics, because you can just squeeze some health out of any enemy, plus the hero is invincible during the animation, making things easier.  Thematically, I don't get why the marine would want to leave enemies half alive just so he could finish them off by hand.    

The automap is a pain during the bigger levels because it doesn't show all of the walls and gates.  So you might think you can walk freely from point A to B when you're looking at the map - nope! In reality, there's a gate blocking your path.   It's really frustrating.   Some levels try to do the old Doom style layouts, where you have to collect the keys and then head back to the critical path, but mostly it's just a linear progression.  There's a compass that point you in the right direction... except, sometimes it points you to a path that's blocked, which isn't helpful.   

I do like the jumping controls, but there's way too much jumping in general.  The original Doom didn't have jumping at all! 

I'm still playing it, but can't wait for it to be over.  It feels way too long for what it is."
.
"While there is indeed an incredible soundtrack to this game, it is unforunately a scavenger hunt with occasional bits of very fun shooting. I really do not enjoy running around the same areas squeezing into tight corners I have no other reason to go into just to pick up toys so that my stats can keep pace with the game. I found myself spending almost all of my time doing this.

Also it later asks you to start doing combo kills and trying to play the game a certain way, and I'm already wasting time looking for dead guys (in levels full of dead guys) and toys. If there was a way to skip collectibles entirely, I'd have actually enjoyed this game."
"I'm a fan of the original Doom (1993) and Doom 3, but I don't like this one.

During the shooting sections the game is a hell lot of fun, but in between those you have to navigate through way too large, maze-like levels.
On top of that this game is half a collectathon?! Usually this wouldn't be a problem, as one could simply ignore it, but here the collectibles are used to upgrade your gear!

So in the end, three hours of Doom were 20% shooting and 80% navigating through the maze-like levels while trying to find the upgrades and bonus objectives. With all the added bonus objectives, collectibles, challenges and excessive ammo/health drops it also feels much more arcadey and less immersive than the previous titles."
Mid
"I can not recommend this game. tried playing through it a few times but it's so bland.
Nice graphics can't cover the dull gameplay for me. 

get locked in room => fight monsters => repeat.

Looks nice and runs great but really it's just not Doom.
guns sound meh which makes the impact of your shots feel the same.
soundtrack is ok but nothing special really.

Brutal doom is more fun imho."

redundant when you could just play the objectively superior original doom and doom 2
Not for me.

"Good game, there aren't enough enemies to fight in most areas and when you really feel like the combat has reached its climax there aren't anymore enemies left to kill, making you feel left hanging.

Tho the main reason for the negative review is that the game will reset all controller binds when it loads, not just when the game starts up but after you die, and inbetween levels, forcing you to either use mouse and keyboard or making a custom config file to save your settings so they don't get overwritten, then use the console to reset the controls every single time you leave a loading screen."
"this game gets unbelievably boring and stale after the first few hours. Same cycle of ""enter room > enemies spawn > kill enemies > platforming"" repeat for 10 hours. 

The hype was real and I think ID did a great job in reinvigorating the franchise, but after the dust has settled, Doom (2016) ended up being a really well running and gorgeous game that's unfortunately bogged down by a really lackluster and frankly boring campaign."
doom eternal is superior in every way
"👎 Slow movement speed
👎 There is a story that's also lame
👎 No manual saves

👍 Graphics
👍 Sound

Play the Quake 1 remaster, Amod Evil, etc. if you want a good and actually fact-paced game.

At 40 years old I'm clearly still way too young to play this snail-paced game. Maybe I'll pick it up again when I'm 80 and had a stroke. Maybe then the lack of speed will be good."
hi
I used to like to play this.  Now it wont even start.  Shame the games moved from something you actually owned to on line vaporware
After all this hype i thought it would be much better. 4/10
"This game is ridiculously overrated. When I first started playing this game I loved it. No tutorial, gory and stylish aesthetics, fast-pased actions with some epic finishing moves and such. It took me several levels to notice how poor the navigation and platforming in this game is, and its a big part of the game. You feel like you're skating on ice. The amount of times I slid off the map and died when I was just trying to move slightly to the side or backwards was ridiculous, whereas there is a mouse aiming sensitivity setting there is no movement sensitivity setting so this was extremely frustrating to me. 

The suit upgrades are mostly pretty lame so I was hardly ever excited to get them, the gun mods are often poorly explained (how am I supposed to understand that ""turns the gun into a mobile turret"" means -adds a second barrel to it doubling its firing rate-? wtf is that tooltip...). Beyond that theres nothing here. You have only 3 stats to boost and 2 of them (armor and health) do the same thing, why even make a distinction?

Lastly, and this is the biggest issue for me, the gun play feels awful. None of the guns FEEL like they have any punch to them, which in a shooter is like fully censored nudity in porn - what is even the point of the product then? The feel of gun animations and bullet impact animations is what make or break a shooter for me, and here it is completely broken... Even though the guns look nice, when you fire them they feel like using a water squirter on balloon animals. The monsters just pop and tare with no resistance while the guns don't really feel like they're doing any damage until the visual cues let you know that the monster is dead or staggered. This leads to a complete lack in satisfaction during the main part of the gameplay, and because it is extremely repetative, by the endgame it is nothing but a pain to get through it...

I did want to stop and give credit where credit is due - the graphics look awesome. The themes of hell appealed greatly to the horror fan in me and the overall aesthetics are great. The game also has tons of nostalgia-based pleasure for the fans of the classic doom games, I couldn't help but appreciate this.

In conclusion the game's gameplay is such a muted, repetative slog with little satisfaction involved in upgrading and developing your character (if you can call him that). The platforming is archaic and very frustrating. However the game is very cool to look at; the themes are badass af. Ultimately though, all of this makes this game much more fun to look at than to play. As much as I want to enjoy it as a fan of the classic dooms, I really could not and I am so confused by the overwhelmingly positive reviews for this game... how am I the only person bothered by these jarring flaws?"
"Great game, fun and enjoyable...

BUT

if you ever crash, your save files become corrupted and the game becomes unplayable, thank you for nothing!"
"The action is great. Saddly i have a really bad sense of direction... so most of the time, i run in empty corridors building frustration. I regret the purchase."

"I haven't played this game much but I can say this much
Pros:
Good OST
Game is pretty violent, which is good in this case.
Cons:
This game is compeletely repititive, you go into a room and kill a bunch of samy enemies, sometimes you need to «activate» a room and fight several waves of same enemies, which are spawing from the air (or maybe from our protagonist's arse).
Protag is compeletely puny and cannot carry more than 20 shotgun shells or 50 «assault rifle» bulliets.
But you can fix it with upgrades (no, just no).
He also can't reload because the game has NO RELOADING MECANIC and WEAPONS DOESN'T HAVE THE IRON SIGHTS!
This game is basically Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare without any allies, who will open doors for you.
This game has pretty little in common with the actual Doom franchise or with any of good oldshcool FPS.
I had played Wolfenstein the New Order on PS3 and had more fun shooting at enemies with a controller than playng this on an actual mouse.
My subjective score — 6 Woflensteins TNO on PS3 out of 10."
"game crashes every 2 minutes, unplayable"
"it's too gory when you have to saw aliens in half , and there is blood all over the place"
Modern Doom is a joke. Do not fall for the trend. You are better than them.
"Very poorly designed, manages to get repetitive instantly after the first ""encounter""."
i love doom but on pc it is so bad it lags and it gave me a virus my save flies get delted evey day i do not recommend you get doom on a pc and i am going to try get my money back and buy it on my ps4
"Very repetitive gunplay where you 1) shoot and 2) finish off with melee glorykills on repeat. Lack of minimap means you need to visually scan your surroundings for enemies (whose colours bleed into their surroundings). The amount of ledges and platforms in the arenas makes it more annoying to locate and dispatch enemies.

Confusing platforming and exploration. No minimap means you have to constantly open map screen to get your bearings. Also there isn't an option to fix the map in one direction which keeps rotating to your direction, personal preference and all,  makes making sense of the layout more annoying."
"Все баги и лаги игры становятся очень заметны когда апгрейдишь комп. А их к сожалению невероятно много. Баги и лаги со стрельбой это вообще жестяк. Раньше списывал на старенькую видеокарту, Но терь понятно - понабирали по объявлению программеров..."
Slow after playing Eternal
bad
"Story-wise Doom 3 was more interesting. On the plus side, it's still Doom, and hasn't lost its core."
"another fps spoilt by impossible jumping, what on earth is wrong with these brain dead game developers that they cannot understand that people come for a bit of fun and a journey.
waste of money.
added to that is why is so called easy mode so wretchedly difficult the games industry is a massive rip off of epic proportions saved by a handful of decent releases."
The game is boring period
I don't want to rip and tear anymore; i just want to be happy.
"I think I've finally accepted that Doom games aren't for me. I don't care about Doom Guy, the setting, or the music. The enemy execute system is such a boring and repetitive core mechanic of the game. You can't even turn the difficulty up without beating the game first. It's really held back by these two elements for me, and I don't even know if I can stomach attempting to play Eternal. Maybe in a couple years when I forget this experience."
.
mediocre
"I played the demo and bought the game, but I forgot why I didn't immediately rush out to buy it. 

While I've definitely seen worse in the AAA sphere, it still feels like they're putting the gameplay second to graphics. 

I bought it for the way the story was told, but the demo was much more story dense than the full game. 

I feel like I'm not getting my time's worth from this game, especially since I was left feeling wholly emotionally unstimulated by this game."
Despite only having 1.8 hours on this game it is boring af. It’s really just a dusty waste land on Mars and a big space ship on the surface. It’s nothing really good. Not worth the 20 bucks.
Not a game of my liking.
"Not much sick music. I wanted sick music and demon killing, but guns feel weak and the upgrades are confusing."
Mission start -> (Go into a big room and kill monsters for 10 minutes) X 3 -> Mission end
"MFs took my fucking textures



can't have shit in hell"
"This game physically hurt.
I have sensitive hearing and after playing until the fourth level or so I had a terrible headache, no other game has managed to do that this bad. Not to mention spending more time running around in circles and looping back to grab upgrades than actually fighting demons."
I had the game but i deleted it for space and now i don't have it
"This is NOTHING LIKE  the simplistic and thought provoking series - this is way-too "" technical "" - you just want to shoot things ? - well dont look for this game to be a"" fun  "" experience..  oh the graphics are great! ( dont get me wrong ) - but platforms dont work,  and its too hard to   work out how to save your position - you have to play with almost A.I. precision even on the easiest level. In the ORIGINAL doom...you found secret rooms an items - but you had the opportunity to find new more powerful weapons. but this? this is just stupid.

I think ID soft have lost the plot and forgotten the basic laws of "" fun "".. its too difficult to "" learn "" all these rules and things.. - whatever happened to simple shoot em ups with great maps?  They went WAY-TOO TECHNICAL with this edition. People just want to have some shoot em up fine like the ORIGINAL was - not this over-bearing rubbish. - I do NOT recommend this game for people that just want some doom in the "" classical "" terms - this is too difficult to actually "" enjoy ""."
why do i have to agree to a term of service bethesda?
"This game is a generic lame a$$ dumb shooter. It's not worth anything, really. How it's ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" is just beyond reason. Are you like just pretending that it's cool because it's doom, that's it?"
"I'll refund it. Not fun. Shoot the enemies, when they glow, press f and that's all. Also, it doesn't feel like you're shooting at something. Bullets just touch to demons until they glow. Yesterday I was playing Middle earth shadow of mordor. Even in that game, when you slain orcs, you feel like you're killing something. But in this game, feels like you're shooting paintball pellets.

Walking around sci-fi maze labs isn't fun too. I can't really get how this game became very popular."
"This game is a snooze-fest. Shoot monster until they glow, press button for QTE, repeat until the room is clear. I have no idea how this game achieved notoriety, it's so overwhelmingly boring."
"run gun run gun jump look at confusing map run gun jump lots of noise...throw brain in the bin...run gun jump....wow...if i play this a few more hours i'll get the ""you are now clinically retarded"" achievement ..yeah not for everyone"
Once again a tipical american greedy crap bullshir. it get's harder by the minute. Monkey never learns.Your time is allmoust Up us Morons!!!
nao funciona da erro
"Annoying platform elements and useless double tap jumps boots WTF!! why not a jetpack it would be more practical. Enjoyed the game up until I felt like Mario jumping across a pipeline after that the game became a tedious slog and if you don't have the correct weapons selected before going into an area you will get your a*se handed to you, preferred the mid 2000s Doom reincarnated as BFG, felt like ti was more story driven"
overrated
"This is the first game I've refunded in a while. I felt that the weapons had very little audio/visual feedback and felt weak against the spongy enemies. There is very little sense of danger, something which is very important in these games. Little sense or feeling of anything at all really. Damage enemy, press 'F', rinse and repeat. It's just not for me."
Took me 8 hours to finish the game...
"A lot of violence and gore. Do not support it and against of them.
In general games and especially like this one are bad for mental health and conscientious."
"When I launched the game I was greeted with dozens of EULA's and Code of Coduct (of course) which Bethesda require's you to accept before you can proceed with the game.
This is despite having no warning on the store page about that.
If you actually read the Code of Conduct you'll discover it contains the ususal cancer about ""protected categories"", ""hate speech"", ""disruptive behavior"" and even (I kid you not!) ""spreading of false information or conspiracy theories about ZeniMax and its game studios, game(s), or employees"".
I'm sorry but there's only so much cancer I can take at a time.
Anyway, this all looks like the rules for the Zenimax's forum or something. Except I'm not on a forum, I just want to play damn signle-player game. I'm not planning to talk to anyone and no-one should be forced to accept these terms for just wanting to play the game.

Asked for a refund."
"The game is fun for a first person shooter story game. Although, the story was predictable, and the game is RIDDLED with game ending glitches. What do i mean by ""game ending glitches?"" I mean because you threw a grenade, and tried to fire your weapon too fast it glitches, and doesn't allow you to shoot, throw grenades, or switch weapons. (while big demons are destroying you i might add) The only fix i could find when it happened, AND IT HAPPENED OFTEN, was opening steam overlay, and exiting it until it allowed me to use my weapons again. 
The suit upgrades would put upgrades into the next tier rather than the one you quicked so instead of being explosive damage resistant, i was instead a better map scanner. 
for a game 5 years after it came out, the fact that these simple, everyday glitches haven't been fixed tells me to tell yall NOT TO GIVE THESE PEOPLE MORE MONEY!! I was playing to finish the game, nothing else. 
Other than all that, i'd give the game a 3/10
without the glitches? 6.5/10. I'd go back, and watch youtube videos of the important parts if you were playing for Doom Eternal backstory.

I do like Doom Slayers backstory though, pretty cool on that front. Skip this game though, they aren't going to fix the glitches, and they make it almost unplayable. I would've quit after the 2nd time, but i'm stubborn."
this game is way overhyped it absolutely sucks lmao
"dogshit game supposed to be action but makes you backtrack/look for keys/listen to bullshit story that isn't interesting

game put my gun away and locked me in a room during some narration sequence and at that point I had enough."
"This game is fine but it leans wayyy to heavily into treasure hunting. You spend about 5 minutes killing and then a half-hour scouring the map trying to find a damn upgrade. Treasure hunting is more rewarded then combat, a majority of the upgrades are from finding shit. Weapon Mods, Suit Upgrades, Health/Ammmo Upgrades, ""Secrets"", essential guns (!), Runes, Doom Guy figurines, useless Map Lore. All of it is found by scouring every nook and cranny of the map. You decide to either look for the crap, which kills the game momentum, or you press on and hope that you didn't need that Health Upgrade."
"Probably is very fun, but stutters continuously on minimum settings with an i5-8400 and a GTX 1070. I'll probably try again if I can ever get a new video card."
Why does the game come with a stupid button right next to your weapon select... that when you press it completely corrupts your save?
Multi is deader than Epstein.
i dont like doom guy he is ray william johnson
Too much melee
"I felt weird for refunding this game but it's not that enjoyable for me to be honest. It's good but it's not for me, so try it for yourself and make your own decision."
"You know I would've gotten farther, but it seems like they just wanna kill me with their mine carts! What another bugthesda masterpiece of garbage 0/10"
"Despite no third party EULA warning on the store page, the game greets you with an unskippable EULA when you start the program. Scummy. That means they are counting on you blindly or begrudgingly accepting, having just installed a 60GB game and invested time and resources into it already."
"If you are a NOT a hardcore old-school DOOM, this a well made modern FPS that will probably give you an average of 8-10 hours of fun, just get in on sale and enjoy.

If you ARE a hardcore old-school DOOM or FPS player, I do not recommend this game, you will be disappointed."
"Overall game is good but secrets can go fuck themselves because when you go back and it says ""checkpoint reached"" and you exit and save it saves it and you can look back and it says you've done it but as soon as you press continue game when you're done everything resets and this makes it literally impossible to get the secrets unless you've already completed the campaign. Wasted 2 days of gametime on this shit fuck this game. If Steam wasn't bullshit I'd ask for a refund."
bad game
too many cutscenes  not enough demon killing 0 out 2
Was fun until awful checkpoint placement in Lazarus lab wanted me to replay WHOLE section... no Ill rather not play game with bad checkpoints....
"idk, not really all that fun. Games have this thing called ""mastery"" or something, you achieve it over time and it makes the game feel good to play. Alongside that, this game has a lot of issues to pair it with. The entire game is just shooting aliens and watching unskippable cutscenes (ofc), but there are points in every damn level where you finish clearing a room and have to backtrack through this labyrinth of a map, trying to figure out which doors you can and cannot open with what keycards you currently have, none of which is easily labeled on the level map you can pull up.
On top of that, there is just way too little ammo in this game. You can find the ammo pickups (specific to each weapon) or you can get RNG drops from enemies when you use a finisher, which you should basically be doing on every single alien to get enough ammo even on the easiest difficulty. I can't imagine how often you'd be using the nerf gun of a pistol if you were playing on a difficulty where the enemies were even greater bullet-sponges...

The momentum is nice, the shooting is ok, the gameplay is a little less action-oriented than something like Half Life, to my surprise, which also isn't really my cup of tea.

Edit: I have been informed from multiple sources that the shortcomings I touched upon here are in fact bullshit, and were fixed in the sequel, so I now feel 100% justified in my assessment.

Edit 2: They were not ""fixed"" in the sequel, merely replaced. All of my issues with the combat and map design are still valid but in a different frustrating way."
مملة و فيها تكرار
overrated piece of shit. 5 years has passed and they never addressed save file corruption/deletion. ubisoft tier devs
"For some reason I just found it really boring, especially when compared to similar shooters (Painkiller Black, Shadow Warrior). Just like the Wolfenstein remakes I can see the great deal of effort put into the game and everything works fine, but compared to the classic games it just feels hollow and lacking in charm."
I have turned off razor setting but my keyboard lights go crazy when i play and i cannot turn it off. it hurts my eyes so bad and flashes and could probably give someone epilepsy. i hate it. ruined the game for me.
Poor Controller imputes not very inclusive of you my guys.
It's a great game at first. Then it starts to get boring pretty fast. I prefer fast game play over this. You are better off with Project Brutality over this.
"theres more times i've noclipped through the map by glory killing a demon than there are stars in the sky

just play doom eternal instead"
there is a glitch where if you throw a grenade and shoot your gun you wont be able to swap or use any abilities and this happens at least 40% of the time I play this game.
"I understand that this is a game well loved by everybody but it just didn't click with me. It was truly a slog to play through the 12 hours that I did where I would play an hour or two once every month or so until I finally realized I am never going to enjoy the game.

Movement feels floaty. Guns aren't really satisfying. Enemy types are REALLY boring despite being so varied. The first 2 or so hours rocked until I realized the entire game was going to just be Enter room -> clear room -> kill boss (or miniboss) on repeat forever"
this game is so slow for a doom game
"Developers, Please! I can not get this game to run!"
"The shooting is fun, the endless scavenger hunt is not. I don't want to miss out on an important game feature or not be able to upgrade my guns just because I miss a turn."
too easy
too much blood and shooting
"I guess this game was just not for me. I've played some of doom 95 back in a day and I enjoyed doom 3 when it came out, yes I'm old, but this one, not so much. It's just too repetitive and dull for me. Maybe if multiplayer wasn't dead... Now I do get why most new players would like this version. If you're into rampaging through hordes of hellspawn your're in for  a treat. For me, I was looking for a horror shooter with constant tension and looking anxiously at every dark corner. If you're looking for more of a doom 3 feel you won't like it, but if you're looking for an all out war on hell, this one is for you!"
"The constant combat, enemies, gore and epic music makes this a very satisfying experience along with its detailed hellish landscape with it. In terms of the singleplayer campaign, it is very repetitive, but satisfying. You basically murder your way through the arena, completing whatever objectives you have, exit to next arena repeat. In other words, the campaign is EXTREMELY repetitive and the level design is too complex. I don't even know how many times I've gotten lost or try to figure how to get back to a certain spot. The multiplayer is basically Quake. End of story. Overall, the game is one of the most satisfying games I've played in terms of combat, but even with that satisfaction, the feeling gets worn off by constant repetition in the campaign. I don't hate the game, but don't love it either."
Too hard shit.
Tryhard camp.  Lame and stupid and thinks it can get away with it by noticing how lame and stupid it is.  Gameplay that beats you over the head with its formula.  Tedious and unfun.
Huge FPS drops....tried everything but still get them with a 1060 maxq even on low settings
insufficent space
"Honestly, I don't know why everyone raves about this game. Not to say that the developers didn't do a good job, but it's just very bland. Sure the graphics look nice, but that doesn't make up for how repetitive the game is. I mean I guess some people can deal with mindless shooting of things but I can't really. There isn't anything to keep the game fresh after 10 hours of playing. Severely disappointed with how highly this game is spoken about."
"I know I'm in the minority here, but this game does not live up to the hype. All the levels look the same with random gore splattered on everything, and the music gets really old really quick because listening to blaring heavy metal can only be entertaining for so long. 

The worst part is the gameplay. It is very active and movement-based, but its the same loop time and time again. The way you play (run in circles and hold down shoot when your crosshairs pass over a demon while screeching heavy metal blares in your ears) never changes for the entire game. The only thing that really changes is the weapon you choose to use but even that has no effect on how you play. 

One of the most annoying things is that they have multiple waves of enemies in a lot of these rooms, and if you're having trouble with something on the last wave you have to keep re-fighting through all the waves leading up to it after you die, which makes difficult sections simply frustrating and tedious."
EPIC TERROR
"I like DOOM games, but this one didn't do it for me. I heard good things about it and decided to give it a try, and while I enjoyed it at first, that quickly wore off. This game suffers from poor and confusing level design, EXTREMELY repetitive combat, and horrible weapon balance (Which also contributes to the repetition since There are some clearly overpowered weapons that make most combat encounters a joke.) Eventually I just got bored and quit. It's not a bad game, but you can definitely tell that DOOM Eternal is more polished."
Final boss bug still not fixed. (after 3 final boss kills i could finally somehow do glory kill...)
Yeah it's cool but also boring.
"Unnecessary and weak... Guns does tesla powered pew sound instead of hard BANG and gunplay feels like im shooting from plastic nerf guns instead of... Well just look at them. Enemies feels like basic ai ""go for the player"" with bullet sponge numbers. Died 2 times in 1h playtime because of bugs and got stuck in a wall after ""finisher"" once."
"Pretty sure tedious arena fighting was more a Serious Sam thing than a Doom one, and there and at the time it made sense, I guess people like this kind of 'gameplay' where you either have ape-like reflexes and are already good at the game, or train yourself like some sort of idiot computer algorithm to quickly recognize moving shapes ? Sad. I even hear some believe there is 'tactical thinking' involved, like they genuinely believe an 8-year-old with better reflexes wouldn't beat them at this dumb waste of time. Impressive levels of delusion and conceit."
"It looks to be a decent game, better than Doom 3 at least. The issue I have with it is that it makes me violently ill from motion sickness. I've managed to play it for about an hour total over two sessions and both sessions ended the same way: me calling Herb on the big white telephone. No game since We Love Katamari has made me so ill. If you're not troubled by motion sickness you may find something to enjoy here. Maybe, I don't know. I never got far enough in to see. If you are a fellow sufferer, you've been warned."
"One of the worst games I have ever played, I have absolutely nothing good to say about it.

I don't know how anyone can find it enjoyable in any way, some people do, and you might be one of them, but this is my review so you're getting my opinion, which is that the game is not even worth thinking about getting, even if it was free"
"A Doom wiithout modding, with sickening orange hue all over, and with shotgun that sounds like a sneeze. Yuck."
0/10 too much blood
"While the game itself is pretty good and fun, i'm leaving a negative review because of the glitch regarding your progression through missions.

I tried going back to a mission I once completed to re-clear and get any missing collectables, however I have realized that the mission progression is pretty much stuck no matter what you do. I've looked for a workaround for this problem but it appears there's no solution to this."
"it was a great game until a bug prevented me from finishing the game. An invisible wall prevented me from glory killing the final boss after defeating it. This bug is the worst I can remember encountering in any game I've ever played. It spoiled the experience ultimately and will make me think twice about buying Doom Eternal. I played the entire game and did not get the satisfaction I earned for beating it. WHY THE HELL DID THEY NOT FIX THIS BUG? IT'S BEEN FOUR FUCKING YEARS AND BETHESDA IS A HUGE COMPANY!
Also, the fps dropped from 50-70 to 15 in the last mission, making it way more frustrating than it would have been otherwise. Ultimately, the game is a lot of fun but Bethesda should have patched this giant, game-breaking bug."
"I really enjoyed this game's multiplayer on Xbox and was very excited to play it on PC. Bought it, loaded up, adjusted settings, and no matches. Dead game even on a Saturday evening sadly but even when we would barely have enough people to start the game at least 1 or 2 people would be auto booted to reset the search for players and intermission countdown.. I was the one booted a few of those times but would see others go and comeback all the same. Is the game dead cause the multiplayer is broken?? Please fix this.."
Far cry from what Doom 3 offered.  Game focuses on alternate objectives and quick shooting vs the immersive fear/hell narrative once forefront in Doom games.
"This game just isn't fun.  

Yes I know: millions sold, rave reviews, a successful sequel - I'm obviously in a minority here.  I think the biggest problem for me is that making the Glory Kill mechanic central to progression strips all the fun out of it, weaker enemies merely become ""health pinatas"", as I once heard it aptly described.   And for a game that apparently resulted from a desire to make an updated Doom game that 'feels like Doom' - well, it just doesn't feel like Doom.  Why not just make a Doom game with the basic mechanics of the original, but with updated graphics and controls, and some cool new weapons?  In a way, I would even have preferred if they had released the abandoned 'Call of Doomy' version this replaced, if only out of curiosity to see how it came out.

I know there are people looking at my playtime and thinking 'that idiot just hasn't played it enough, he probably hasn't even got any of the good weapons or started to play the  fun parts', and they may well be right.  The truth is though that those three hours felt like thirty to me.  I just don't like it."
"Huge disappointment.  I love FPS games, and the original Doom series was epic, but this is just a repetitive mess made worse by the checkpoint saves."
"almost to the end and game freezes halfway though level and i have to hard reset it to close the game, i have hp omen 15 1660ti and play warzone regularly so i doubt problem is on my end, this game is 5 years old and made millions of dollars fix your fn bugs?!? also all the satan blowhards saying this is the greatest game are dorks its good but its by far not the greatest game ever released"
"Dark and edgy, in a boring way."
"Wow blood, never seen that before."
"If you're looking for a fast paced shooter where you can just chain kills on enemies in the most satisfying as ways possible (as I was), this might not be the game for you. Emphasis on might as I know that this game is very well received and do see some aspects that would make it more enjoyable for other people. For me however, I really just didn't enjoy it. It felt slow. I would just walk around, occasionally shoot some enemies, press e on the occasion I needed to interact with something, wander more trying to figure out where I needed to go, and the level ends. This is not the fun gameplay I was expecting from Doom. Now who knows. Speaking that my playtime was literally just 40 minutes, it might get better later on in the game. However, the slow intro that I experienced defiantly did not keep me interested in continuing. The game looks nice, it plays nice, but gameplay wise, it isn't my cup of tea."
"It's just kind of ok, I guess.

The shootin' has a good amount of speed and aggression required, but not as much as DOOM or other boomer shooters. 

Repetition in combat is kind of fine, but I can't say I felt any kind of real connection to it.

Waaaay too many platforming sections. Personally I found the level exploration kind of annoying, as I fell off the level many times and was sent back to the start.

The main plot is generic and boring, but it bashes you over the head and forces you to listen to NPC dialogue, even though Mr Doom Guy doesn't care.

So many secrets to find, upgrades for your armour, or your weapons. Honestly, none of the upgrades caught my eye, and I don't care about the secret collectables.

I really wanted to like it, but I felt like it struggled to engage me. Any enjoyment I was extracting was counteracted by the bludgeoning from the terrible plot, and being annoyed with the autosave."
"It looks like doom but it's significantly slower paced than the original doom games. Feels like i'm playing call of duty campaign with a really nice realistic doom graphics. Seriously this game sucks ass, it's one of the most hand holding gaming experiences i've ever played, THIS IS FUCKING DOOM WTF. Go play the original Doom's in VR, Bitch."
"This game is damn mess. I've already spent 3 fucking hours trying to get this game to run on my PC by messing around with my GPU settings and all sorts of other stuff. It just won't work.

Edit: I managed to resolve all the damn graphical and framerate issues and it's a pretty good game. Just a shame I had to waste so much time to finally be able to play."
not fun just shoot alien
Combat was boring so I never got around to beating it
"i really can't in good faith recommend a game that has now caused two separate graphics cards to shit themselves every 15 minutes.
-my previous computer had an RX480 3GB card in it. that straight up wouldn't run doom at anything more than potato settings. this is a computer that didn't have problems with other AAA games, but doom at anything other than ""low""? prepare for VRAM errors and crashes. i didn't give it much patience because i was due for an upgrade anyway.
-my current computer has an 8GB RX 5500 HD that runs most games at high or ultra, had zero crashes running Control by remedy games at high, and can run elite dangerous for hours without even blinking. every 5-15 minutes, without fail, i get a ""driver timeout"" and it crashes. on medium. with many graphical features turned off.

just another day at bethesda, i guess. cool to see no one else has as many problems, but i don't have time to go troubleshooting issues like this for hours. there are other games i can be playing."
the creatures are scary
"Awkward level design, falling through maps, missing sounds, randomly timed enemy spawns leaving some areas empty for actual minutes before something that is supposed to spawn finally does, cursor not being locked to the game on fullscreen, weapons becoming obsolete quick even with upgrades, worthless default controls and an absolutely useless 3D map and menu.

Really wanted a game like this but this borders on an unplayable mess.
Genuinely dumbfounded at how this game has >95% positive reviews and revived the franchise."
this game is so insanely boring and overrated and i want to kill myself now because of this game so if i do its your fault losers die
I was expecting a great game. I adjusted the brightness before the campaign started. Once the campaign started the display was so dark and reddish I couldn't even see the enemies. I reinstalled the game but could not reset the brightness. This is a disappointment.
"Tedious trying to find your way around a very samey environment with almost no clues as to where you are, and the same monsters attacking constantly. Even on the very easiest setting it is far too difficult to get through each level. I'm not even halfway through and given up now as it is not possible on easy to beat all the enemy they put against you."
Totally lacks the feeling.
"Doom 2016 is a fun game at times but its very flawed. If you've already played eternal then you most likely are not going to enjoy this. The combat gets extremely repetitive after a few mission and by mission 10 engaging in combat becomes tediuse. Combat is completely broken with things like siege mode, Double fire super shotgun and a rune that frequently gives you BFG ammo from fodder demons. Every fight can be won the same way just spam super shotgun and siege mode maybe the occasional rocket. All of this makes the combat incredible boring, Repetitive and easy. So the main part of a doom game the combat really sucks. The environments arnt much better either. Every mission has the same colour pallet. Just grey, red and piss green. Its boring. The games graphics are very good. For a 5 year old game it still looks great. The game doesnt really have a story unless you dig deep into codexs which for a doom game I think is great way to handle story. But the game still several times locks you in a room with an npc and spends minutes talking about the story with no way to skip them. There are also multiple sections of horrible platforming. Unlike eternals platforming that teaches you how to traverse environments to assist in combat 2016s platforming is entirely pointless and badly designed. It has no purpose and frequently the slayer will just refuse to grab on to ledges for no reason causing you to fall to your death. So in general this is not a good game in my opinion but if you have not played eternal (A much better game) I can see you enjoying this game alot more than I did."
"This game was praised as return to the old days of FPS, i.e. fast, bloody and violence, not story driven. 
Every game reviewer made a huge deal out of the starting sequence when the doom guy, instead listen to the exposition, smashes the monitor. 
Yeah, bravo whooho, down with the dumb standing around and listen to the idiots. 
But the very next cut scene immobilizes me while the doctor lady turns the power on for the drill. 
What is this crap?
If this game was really what is was advertised as, i would have the option to bash the glass in, rip the arms of the women and stick them up her butt!
Glory kills get boring and repetitive after 20 minutes, first person platforming is the same dumb idea it was 20 years ago and these challenges getting passive upgrades are so out of place it kills the immersion. 
Five years after release and the sound problems are still in the game. Hint: Don't use bluetooth headphones.

This game is once more the reason why i don't buy games for more then €10. Because most of them are bad. 
And yes, i'm over 40, i played the original Dooms until the old 90s CRT monitors burned my retinas and this is NOT a faithful successor, no matter what overpaid and bribed ""Game Journalists"" tell you. 
And i'm german, so yeah grammar is not my strong suit. Sue me, how many languages do YOU speak?"
Really hard to aim with and makes me motion sick no matter how low I set the motion blur at
"I want to like it. When the original came out it changed my life forever - I still have the original floppies from when I bought the full game after finishing the shareware.

This game does have all the right ingredients, and a lot of polish, but I keep quitting from boredom. The music is ok, better than just generic heavy metal I guess, with strong influences of Trent Reznor which was a nice callback to Quake, but *yawn*. It looks nice, but I think we're long past the point of being wowwed by visuals in games (or movies). What it is all about is the gameplay, and again, it is great, but...I just can't put my finger on what the X factor is that is missing, but while all the details are there: guns that go boom, small enough ammo supply to want/need to change guns a lot, special melee kill that gives you health (reminds me of Space Marine), chainsaw kills to give you ammo.

I'm going to keep playing it, because I feel like there is something wrong with me, not the game. The friend that bought it for me is having a giddy amount of fun, and describes the combat as a ballet of death, so your mileage may vary, but I'm not at all feeling like I'm going to finish it."
"I was so bored with this game. Enter a room and kill the monsters to open the door to the next room, kill monsters in the next room to open another door that leads to another room to kill monsters in..... that's what this game felt like. I found the combat boring and doing it over and over just didn't make it get any better. Graphics were nice, weapons were meh, controls were good and coop may have made this better, but probably not. If this is doom now then I'm done with this crap. Oh and the weapon upgrade system is trash. What a way to make the game less fun and make me want to play even less..... just another reason to not buy anymore in this series."
dumb. time wasted jumping and finding your way through a maze.  Nothing like DOOM which was a outstanding shooter.  Plenty of saves for those of us who don't have endless hours to spend on a game.
"HELP!!! I love this game and its amazing, but it is constantly freezing during loading into, out of, or between missions. Its unplayable. Im not a computer expert, ive updated all drivers, moved it to mechanical hard drive, moved it back to SSD...gonna try to uninstall and reinstall. Googled the problem and there is no ONE fix but it is a common problem. Sorry if there is somewhere else i should have posted this, only been playing on pc for a couple months. I just want to shoot stuff to a BA soundtrack!!!"
"The visuals for this game are great. Blasting hell monsters with the sick melee animations and soundtrack that makes me feel like a bad-ass. At this point, you may believe I have clicked the wrong review hands on accident, but I have not. For the first 2 or so hours I was absolutely loving this game, but as it went on I realized how dry and repetitive this game really is. It is all basically the same concept with some non creative upgrades. The level design is good, but makes really no difference in games like these. If you enjoy doing the same thing over and over in slightly different ways, this is the one for you. Spend your money on a more creative franchise and lessen the hype of this."
very eh
can anyone fix the error with the recent versions of AMD graphic driver?
4 years later and the loading and lag wont even allow me to start the game. Second computer I have tried it on and my current specs are WAY more than needed.
Game crashes on start up very dissapointed.
"Solid shooter, with awesome graphics and good performance.

So... Why the thumbs down?
Well, as you see I only have a few hours into it.

I've made the mistake buying the game upon the hype. Was interested what it is about, but it honestly feels like that Doom movie with The Rock and Karl Urban.
Something which I watched once.
Yet in regards of the game... It's a linear shooter.
Which shouldn't be a problem as I really like linear shooters, but this one simply didn't do it for me.

It's a bit too plain for my taste.

I had it installed for a few months and 3.7 hrs was all I could get out of it.


Then suddenly the game received BIIIIIIIIG multiplayer updates, that got even forced onto people who couldn't care less about some dumb multiplayer mode.
Yet as I already struggled with singleplayer being not really entertaining for me, I uninstalled it and haven't touched it since then.


So for what the game costed, it's surely worth a thumbs down as it failed in entertaining me.
Which is the sole purpose of a video game.

But that's just my own taste it didn't fit with."
this game dose not have much to offer to be honest. its a little slow and it gets boring pretty easily. honestly its a 6.5/10. not worth it unless its on sale.
Boring.
It was pretty boring. I expected a little bit more from A game called Doom. The only Real fun parts of the game were the bosses and there were barely any of them. Not to mention the ending was about as good as the ending from the original Borderlands Which was pretty dull.
"The combat was great, but the lack of any other systems made it get repetitive before I beat it. Don't regret the time I played it for, but I won't finish it"
"Having clocked tens of thousands of hours on the original DooM games, I've tried this one many times since its acquisition but it just cannot keep me playing.

The shooting isn't very interesting and relatively easy. Using the simple gun is all you need most of the time in ""Normal"" difficulty.  I keep hoarding ammo always expecting a big fight, but nothing ever comes.

The most difficult part of the few ""challenges"" so far was to wait for the next loading screen.
It's simple : the ""platforming"" is the biggest killer so far.

There is also a multiplayer mode but that again was a disappointment. Instead of the raw brutality of DooM, ""victims"" (and maybe other players at some point, it's a bit fuzzy) get tracking and other ""cheat"" perks.
I guess it's nice if you aren't very good at this and want to have some kills but it feels cheap.

There are way better games for high-speed gunning raw violence."
"Not deaf/HoH accessible in the slightest - subtitles are only for cutscenes, and do not provide in-game support for enemy noises, etc. Very unfortunate since this looks like a fun game otherwise."
terrible game
Unskippable cut scenes. One-way maps (can't backtrack to look for secrets etc). Overcomplicated weapons system. Visual mess. Dehumanization
"People often criticised me for this opinion, but I think people are more willing to hear it now that hype isn't such a factor. This game while a good FPS, and probably the best FPS we've had in awhile, is not a good Doom game. Certainly it's better than Doom 3, and makes a much better attempt even at capturing what Doom (1993) felt like, but nonetheless it falls short and there are a few things I really take issue with.

Nu-Doom is rather slow, sure it's fast, but the game never once is moving at the pace of it's 1993 predecessor. In the original Doom you would find yourself flying down hallways at blinding speed cutting down everything in your path. Nu-Doom both has the character physically moving slower as well as slowed down the overall pace of gameplay. They have done this by introducing glory kills, which especially on higher difficulties, become absolutely mandatory to maintain ammo and restore health, as pickups are not enough, these animations break the pace of gameplay even if sped up, making us stop our rampage to watch a two second cutscene. They also rather than having maze like maps requiring keys where you tear through enemies all the way through. Nu-Doom has you go between empty to nearly-empty hallways, to enter an arena, in order to fight waves of enemies, to enter another hallway, and repeat the process. This loop is nothing like the original Doom and ruins part of what gave the original it's energy. Finally the weapons in Nu-Doom do considerably less damage than their 1993 counterparts in which many could tear down enemies in a single shot or less than a few seconds. In Nu-Doom we find fights with enemies lasting a bit longer, taking more hits, and ending with glory kills.

A side complaint is Nu-Doom is not storyless, though it is story minimal. Really though it has a story and isn't different from many other shooters. This is extremely annoying, the original Doom's story amounted to nothing more than some text at the end of an episode. This may also contribute to the slower overall pace of the game.

Finally the limitations on and subsequent lack of community made content puts the final nail in Doom 2016's coffin, Doom 1993's ability to be modded and it's modding community alone are what had given it's staying power on top of an already solid core game. To this day one could spend thousands of hours alone just playing through community made content for classic ID software shooters.

The game is by no means terrible, but it isn't anything like the original Doom. If you want a game that captures that classic FPS energy I recommend playing something like Devil Daggers or DUSK."
"It failed to draw me in. I just didn't care. It did not give me adrenaline, sense of achievement, any intrest in the story. The weapons felt akward, arenas - small, battles - repetitive and not satisfactory.

Yeah, nice graphics..."
"I decided to give this game a shot after hearing lots of people sing its praises.  After almost an hour of play, I decided to quit, as there was nothing really keeping me playing.  The gameplay was lackluster (Games like Destiny 2 and Overwatch have much better moment-to-moment gameplay), the story was virtually nonexistent (Though maybe I didn't give it enough time), and even their main new thing - using melee finishers to get health back - didn't feel polished in my opinion."
"I would have recommended this game, but the last boss cannot be killed by a lot of players, including myself.  You wipe out his hp, then he just sits there.  Looks like this has been a bug since the game was realesed."
"(1 playthrough completed on Nightmare difficulty)

All style ZERO substance.

The first few hours of this game were great. Amazing visuals, great music, cool atmosphere, and a likeable character to play. After a few hours you realise that this is it. There is nothing more to the game. After level 3 you have pretty much everything you're gonna use, and have seen pretty much everything. All that changes is a slightly fatter enemy type joins the endless hordes you have to fight. Level upon level of  this:
Walk a few paces -> Fight horde -> Checkpoint -> Repeat.
This is NOT how OG Doom used to be and seeing as I sincerely hope Eternal is NOT following in this games footsteps for gameplay. I was so SO bored of walking into a room, the room being sealed due to ""Demonic Presence"", killing everything in the room to open the door and repeat. The levels are all so similar. The ""arenas"" you fight in are all so similar. It was just so boring from midway onwards. 

When I buy a game I like to be able to sit and put hours into it and really get into the game. This games repetitive nature does NOT allow this. If you are going to play this game do no more than 2 levels a day. That way the monotony might not seem as stark. Even the music repeats itself throughout the game. They couldn't even take the time to put different music to different maps.

4/10 and thats being generous."
"Thanks Bethesda for ruining Doom. Just your name on it alone is a curse.
Not even the flash of fatalities (a gimmick which is just repetitious) could convince me to keep this game. I only spent ten dollars and I'm getting a refund. If I want Doom, I'll play 1, 2, 64 or 3. Also, you triggered fan boys whose only experience with adrenaline is the feeling they get when they play this game can go fuck yourselves back into that stinky hole your mom calls her birthing canal. Thanks."
"Pleasant at the beginning, I quickly realised how repetitive the gameplay was. Very painful to finish. I've never played a Doom before, so the magic of nostalgia couldn't work on me."
Just purchesed the game and can't even start as engine crashed. Can not even sent a report as the system not allow to upload the information. Very disapointed I have also bought Doom Eternal - hope that will work!
shit
"Overall grade: 4/5 in general, 1/5 with the present audio mixing.

Bought this game for 9,99€ on a sale based on a bunch of recommendations from friends. After approximately 40 minutes of decent gameplay, I had to put this down for good.

On the positive side, this is a competent shooter with a completely fine general feel of gameplay. The starting weapons are well selected in that they incentivize close-range gameplay that naturally teaches the player to use the glory kills. The music is good, and the game looks pretty enough (even if all the environments kinda look samey).

At the same time, the secret searching facet seems to be greatly at odds with the basic premise of high-octane gun-running gameplay. If you are the type of player that feels a need to find all secrets (especially when presented with a goal to do so), it'll probably get old rather fast.

But the most major problem, and the reason I had to put the game down, is the general sound design. In brief, the basic zombies (""Possessed"", or whatever they are called) are so unreasonably loud compared to all other sound sources, I had to either lose all other sound (including audio logs) or feel physical pain from the loud screeches. In brief, the sound mixing is simply unacceptable. If you are fine with missing the audio logs (and most of the other audio), then you'll do fine: just bump the music on high and the other sound effects rather low. If you are not fine with that, then I really can not recommend this game."
"Arena shooter, very action packed and fun for the first couple of hours a bit of a chore after that.

The originals and doom 3 were a lot better."
"I beat an entire bossfight, just to not get a checkpoint then have another one."
i don't own this game
cant even fix the mouse :)
"Get it on a sale if you must, nothing grabbed me, nothing hooked me, boring."
this is the most overrated game I've played in my entire life
"Boring and repetitive. Enter a level, shoot all demons got to next area to do the same."
404 doom soul not found.
"This game is a bug! It took me 90 hours to figure out that everytime you click ""Restart Mission"" it will wipe out about 80% of all achievements you've got on previous missions! Hell no I am going to go through all this crap again!"
"I’ve been playing FPS games since Wolfenstein 3D hence apparently this new iteration should’ve amazed me. But it doesn’t. It bore me to death. Man, these ultra super state-of-the-art graphics are so f****** soulless. Go play some (GZDOOM) mods instead such as Brutal Doom or somethin’."
"There is a lot of good to be said about this game, but the achievements and collectibles are what ultimate kill this game for me.
They are very front and center and in direct opposition to the game flow and just general enjoyment of the game.

Let the secrets be secret and the achievements be actual achievements, not a boring laundry list I have to grind through to level up my character."
good game
Its crashes alot
"NOPE. DO NOT BUY.
All the difficulty levels are set far too high, the game does not improve and becomes very boring purely due to difficulty.
After 3 hours challenges become impossible at all levels.
Save your money, get Wolfenstein."
"it was ok but if you want to shoot enemies just play quake, way more satisfying killing real players than ai. the guns feel similar to quake and i imagine the satisfaction comes from the same repetitive gory execution animations on bots and the gore explosions but this gets old pretty fast

not worth though, just play quake and airshot with the rocket launcher for a way more entertaining experience.
only buy this if you can't compete in games like quake or other fps games and dont understand that satisfaction"
"This game is full of cheap deaths from enemies that spawn directly on top of you, irritating jumping puzzles, and enemies that are practically invincible unless you have the right weapon mod to defeat them.  Compared to the original Doom, there is no ""shoot at it until it dies"" in this game.  There are very particular weapons and strategies that you need to use to defeat specific enemies, which on paper sounds good, but in practice just turns the entire game into a sisyphean task of fighting and dying repeatedly.  At least in that respect, I suppose it's a pretty accurate representation of hell."
exited the game and it made all of my shortcuts clump in one spot. fuck you too bethesta
"If you wish to slay demons. Doom 95 and Doom II gives more demons to kill. If you wish to practice platforming this is for you. I'm so sad that game turns from FPS to platforming. When you play campaign most of your time goes jumping and searching secrets and that is really sad.

Even if you skip the searching for secrets you still spent most of your time jumping around, not killing demons.

I love multiplayer in this game but its dead."
"i mean i woudl recommend this, as it is one of the most fun games ive played, but cannot as the game crashes at a specific point, and ive been able to find no solution."
"Wtf are you crazy with that reviews? I play it in 2021 and still totally buggy. I didn´t expect much from it (just good old-school 3D shooter), but it's a boring and stereotype slasher with no point, no story, no atmosphere. Glory kills have good animations, but after 100 times (it means after 120 enemies) It looks like middle cost fighting simulator. I like Wolfenstein so I would be willing to give It another chance...but It will crash after few minutes of playing. Sorry Beth, not for me."
shithole game
"The game is alright, but not amazing like you would expect. I think the environments are too bland and theres too much orange color grading which makes it hard to navigate the maps (everything looks the same). The gameplay is repetitive as fuck. Not as good music as doom 1. Some mobs are annoying and never die unless you empty your entire inventory of ammo..

It's far from what the original game was in terms of feeling. I'm sure that's intended, why make the same game repeatedly? But they shouldn't have moved away from winning concepts.

It's kinda how like half-life 1 was alot cooler than half life 2. They tried to evolve the game into something it wasn't. Sure many people did like that. This is just my personal opinion."
Pretty good but the doom guy's were quite hard to find and it's a lot of repetition for me.
"Doom isn't a terrible game, it's a decent FPS with nothing revolutionary or but implementing what it has decently. Where the game bugs me, is in the achievement department. If you want to get 100% get ready to grind, plan correctly because some achievements need time (multiplayer achievements where it seems the community has some weird hack at the moment of writing (uzi rocket launcher etc). And one major bug for The Circle is the Complete plan plan plan. Don't get any rune outside the mission arcs or you have to like me delete your safe files and play it all clean again.

So fun game but if you want to be a completionist be ready for a painfull jurney."
"My Doom keeps showing up as ""Not Responding"" after only 4.6 hours of gameplay. I have reinstalled and look online for tips but the game will not play on my PC. It was very fun when i was able to play,"

not a good game
"70gigs cuz id are dog rear at managing the content
dont give us massive texturefiles intended for the next trillenium
stop giving us dog stern raw audio files
just STOP.. you're supposed to be ID dog nagit.
Of course I'd recommend it, it's doom. dermateets."
Strafe Left: the Game.
grim compared to eternal
I hate level select games.
overhyped big wow visuals for big stupids
games fun and cool but the saving system SUCKS i hate it i was nearly done then my save file got corrupted fuck u id!!!
"This PC port is garbage.
1) My sound is just gone. At least when I'm using bluetooth headphones. The game isn't outputting sound, and while it's open, nothing else on my computer has sound either.
2) Even in borderless windowed mode, this game refuses to let me go to be desktop.
3) Why on earth are settings tucked away in starting a new save file
I was really looking forward to trying this game, but I guess I'm not allowed to. Thanks.

EDIT: After fiddling with a ""Handsfree Telephony"" option in the depths of my computer, and restarting, I now have sound. So that's good. It's still shoddy that this is a problem in the first place, and it's still annoying that the application window refuses to play nice, and that settings are tucked under starting a new file.

EDIT 2: I'm mid game and it plays beautifully. Really enjoying my time. However while I DO recommend this game, I'm not changing my recommendation vote. If you want to fiddle with computer settings to get it to work properly, be my guest. I know this is just 0.00001% of reviews in a sea of reviews. But hey, might as well serve whatever warning I can."
The art and music is amazing but the gameplay feels bland. Your shots don't have any weight or chunkyness to them and so it just feels like you're shooting paper balls at enemies. Tried to play it back when I recieved it in a Humble Bundle and still can't play it in 2021 lol
"This game was way too repetitive . People say doom eternal is even more repetitive . If anyone has paid over $6.00 for this game , i feel sorry for you. It's very underwhelming. By the 3rd chapter out of the total 13 chapters you've basically seen everything in the game. Note that the game only has 3 bosses so yea that was a huge let down. Same animations over and over. This was my first and last doom game ever. Its very mediocre."
T'wasnt very fun. Run and kill big monster does get boring after not too long this game is actually carried by the soundtrack which i'll admit slaps hard. Meh game. 5/10
"0/10

i was with my mum at st vinnes, and then this doom guy (a.k.a ig fat green hulk cock man) was standing right nezt to her. then she gave him a blowgun and we went to gfo rAPE THE DEMOSN!!!!!! i wqas getting hurttting because i got hurt....

but then dante and jesse filipino twins came and...... rescued,............ then we killed all of them!!! and won filipino!!!!"
The game does not launch and all of the information they gave to fix the launching does not work and you can try to fix it yourself in files and downloading things off the internet or you can wait for a patch from bethesda with i would not count on anymore
the challenge for boost ammo is to hard
"Don't buy this game, buy the second instead.

wheetween giving a thumbs up or thumbs down I would like to give a neutral review but as I can't...

As of actuall shooters movement is slow, feels like you are a brick shooting. After clearing a map in some minutes it's a desert and the only thing left is to explore for items, but the maps are boring, all like jump here ""you jump you'r smurt"".

The enemies are dumb, it feels like it should be orde-game like but nop, first is all heavy metal-adredaline rush but after one or two minutes, when they are dead there is silence... and exploration... for toys... it contrasts too much with the action vive of the game. 

Somewhat it doesn't have the essence of the original DOOM, it feels more like another bethesda wolfenstein. The weapons are unoriginal the B.F.G. is a B.F.Shit there is no need or place to use it, the only thing relatively good is the chainsaw but instead off being a melee is a powerup item that needs gas, is all shoot, shoot and again... The demons are boring there is no feeling of fighting evil is the same as fighting babies, even the crippled old lady from the story is more badass than the demons.

The only difficulty is finding ammo... but actually there is so much ammo there is no difficulty and you get like infinite ammo from mid game...

Overall gameplay gets repetitive fast and the game is sort of short but it doesn't feel short because is gets so repetitive you gonna wanna drop it as soon as able. The problem been the game don't have propper escalation in action, as from the beggining tries to be full hardcore-non-stop but it fails because the demon/zombies are easy-dumb, there is no variety in gameplay, plus the flaw in design that cuts the action to search for colectibles/upgrades and power ups. cutting the gameplay inhigh and low peaks

Honestly my problem with the game is it borrows its identity from a classic title but it's not at the level it needs to be the susesor or remaster of such a legend (I know most doom sequells didn't make it) and it didn't bring anything new from the current generation besides graphics.  If it would have a different name/title/IP no one would recommend it or play it as it's a unoriginal generic shooter game with heavy metal but just super repetitive, this game would reach no where if it didn't stole the fan base of the legendary doom same as many other bethesda games like wolfenstein or prey.

TL;DR is a generic shooter game with heavy metal, it feels too repetitive. it should be called DOOM'b"
"Made me puke. If you're sensitive to motion like me, don't bother.

I mean seriously, is all that shit flying through the air really necessary? None of it hits me. I don't take damage from it. It's just benign debris flying around in the environment. So upon first exiting a building and going outside, I had to quit.

See, it makes my vision disorient, I fall into vertigo and nausea, and then I cant play. So why do I have to see it? Fuck your warnings for people like me, because I played the original without issue. What your environmental coders have done is so non-essential to enjoying the game. You wasted your money paying someone to code that trash, and I wasted my money buying it. Here's a good guidance statement: the environment need not be so full of flying debris that in reality it would warrant eye protection."
"Game is really fun to shoot, rip apart demons, and lots of actions like that. So why do I dont like it? The maps is confusing as hell. Literally have to check my map every 2 seconds every time i go through a door."
"Can't play multiplayer because you need levels to be competitive, and the only way to get levels is to play public games, which puts you against people who are almost always maxed level who will murder you in a fraction of the time it takes you to kill them. That's if there's enough players to actually play with. They need to unlock all the level upgrades so that new players can compete."
sound doesnt work at all
"The maps are fucking confusing.
I really want to continue playing the game but its just annoying to have to go a long way just for a couple of kills."
no
repetitive and bland environments
"Music is the most important thing in a game,and here metalcore genre is not suitable for every moment but it should have been included only in the most excited scenes; this musical choice ruins playability quite a lot thus covering every moment of the game with ridicule; instead,it should have left room for a dark and ambiental soundtrack as in Doom 3.
Weapon sounds are unsuitable and undersized in both volume and timbric parameters.
Movements are too slow,you have the constant feeling of being ""trapped"".
Lobby turns private after 5 minutes,roughly the time needed to load the game and there's no possibility for other players to enter in-game.
Multiplayer is faster and survival mode is funny enough but no one currently plays it.
The two weapon limit is the coup de grace.


A potential masterpiece ruined by too many questionable choices and limitations.

mid as hell
"[h1]Easily one of the most mis-representative games ever.[/h1] The damage control the Catholic church is going to have to establish to combat this sinful mess is daunting.

First of all, demons. Not just any demons. Piñata demons! That's right, the God fearing Christian gamer is encouraged to rip open these demons with a chainsaw to extract ammo from them. Utterly outrageous nonsense. This isn't how you combat Lucifer's minions. You do it the proper Godly way. By exorcising them and then, if the possessed individual is underage, indoctrinating them into your organization before fondling their underwear. Encouraging people to rip and tear demons might give the awful impression that people can handle their own problems without the church monitoring everything they do! How naughty!

Secondly, the portrayal of corporations in this story is silly. The UAC has no control over anything, are directly ignored by the protagonist and are often used as the butt of a joke. Ridiculous! You can't encourage people to ignore the order of big businesses! Several businesses here in America are God fearing and amazing recruitment for our cause! Shame! Shame!

Third, the music. Awful, just absolutely awful. In addition to it being just ear grating techno nonsense, there are pentagrams in the sound files of the game's score! Shame! Shame! Mick Gordon is a confirmed satanist and deserves to be eaten alive by pigmy ants! No wonder his cursed nation of Australia is full of animals made in God's glorious image who want to eat you!

One shutters to imagine what purpose this title has outside of converting our vulnerable, beautiful, intelligent young generation who are chased by old and repressed priests into a bunch of Satanists! Or worse yet... PROTESTANTS! Avoid this game like the heresy that it is!"
"Horrible game. And this comes from a fan of DOOM games. This new one is the worst of all, even worse than DOOM 1. Yes, is has much improved graphics, but it's just a huge mess with way too much detail. Everything dirty, chaotic geometry, too much complexity. All places in this game give that sickening feeling that you have when you walk in a room and it's unbelievably messy and dirty and filthy, thousands of objects thrown all over the place."
Demons cant jump
game sucks i go to bed
"Its time for my doom review.
And its sitting in my steam library, gazing up at me with big soulful eyes like a puppy, and this review feels like I'm kicking that puppy right where it hurts

Right  the positives first.... its doom, the graphics are A+ on my rig, cant fault those, the sound...  it could be better but its right up there and lets you know you're in hell, weapons.....  big.. clanky... go boom a lot, plus can be modded, controls.. fluid and excellent(once you've set decent keybindings of course), enemies....  they're monsters.... and do doomy monstery things,especially if you let them,  AI is pretty good too.

So why do I rate this game so badly....  simple.... the insipid level design, there's no variety ... a bit of climbing/jumping to get through a section, followed by a pile of ammo and a gate to an open area that you know full well will close after you go through. followed by a wave of imps... then hell knight, a rev or 2....  something with a red laser cutter... and baron of hell.
And thats it......  wheres the fear?  wheres the armor/key pickup in the middle of a room that may/may not unleash hell... wheres the empty room  you search for the key/switch for door and get rewarded by being face to face with a monster? wheres the close corridors full of fast moving imps.?
In short , they missed out the very thing that made the original Doom so much fun.

Will I finish the game? more than likely.. on easiest settings and about to google 'god mode switch' 
And if I'd paid full price for it, I'd be very disappointed


Post script.
Completed the game, Review still stands.
Everyone involved with the production of the game gets an A+ apart from the map designers who should be taken out and shot."
No response to gaming mouse!
"The game play is fast, satisfying and fun, but the campaign was just way too short and I feel like it was not worth 25 dollars. The multiplayer is also kind of boring and I could not see myself being interested in it for longer than like 20 minutes. Overall decent game and fun story but way too short."
Pretty much a maze where you do violent things to demons and sometimes to finish a certain objective in my opinion.

This series is cringe and non-canon.
Boring game.
"I'm really not sure why this is considered a good shooter, there are numerous issues with it, in my experience. It honestly felt like a shooter which had been created by people who only ever heard about shooters but never played them.

Firstly, I felt the controls were really clunky. I tried both mouse/keyboard and controller and just hard a really hard time looking and aiming. I tried different sensitivities, acceleration high and low, and just could not get myself set up with something I was comfortable with. I had to turn the difficulty down -- not because I found the game hard, but because I found myself taking so long to get my aim right.

Secondly, for a linear shooter, I sure did spend a lot of time getting lost and wondering what it was I was supposed to be going to and doing. There were plenty of times where you get locked into a room and then the thing I was supposed to do next was meticulously go through all the consoles until I found the one that had a contextual prompt to unlock the next door. Why? What a waste of time. Furthermore, the contextual prompts themselves often only show when you stand on top of them and look straight at them. If you're gonna put redundant button pressing activities in your shooter at least make them big and glowy (or, better yet, just get rid of them or make your processes automatic).

FInally, for a shooter, there certainly is a massive over-reliance on meleeing / 'takedown' moves and conservation of ammo. Ammo is a scarce commodity and you spend a lot of time just using the basic starting pistol because you've either run out of ammo or want to save it for the harder enemies.

All in all, it just feels like they took a fun franchise and took all the fun parts out."
"Paid $60 when this came out. Might as well be called ""Glory Kill"" since all you do is melee execute almost every single demon in the game for some reason."
Hell No!!!
"I wanted to love this game but I just don't.
The first few hours were fun, with good action, nice daemon AI (the Imps have great mobility) and cool graphics.  But this game just gets boring…  The same monsters, a monotonous level design, gore-kills ad nauseum, very poor platform sequences, etc.
I loved the original Doom and played for hours on.  Hell, I still play it from time to time and don't get bored.  Doom 2016 just doesn't work for me.It's one of the very few games I purchased and didn't even care to finish…

Update: I did end up finishing the game.  I guess it’s a game I needed to play a few hours at a time because I quickly get sick of how repetitive it is, but it is not so bad."
"This game is awesome. Epic gameplay and even more epic soundtrack. 

Sadly I got booted out of single player mode when steam decided to disconnect. This game is protected by denuvo anti-tamper, and you aren't able to play SINGLE PLAYER MODE while offline. I'd consider a refund, but I'm already beyond the refund period. Make sure you check into DRM on games before you purchase them.

If you have bad internet, you won't be able to play this game."
This game runs like shit now ..where as before it would run decent/...fuck you bethesda and steam
"Really fun game, which I'd give 8/10 for if it wasn't for a corrupted save file twice. So I'm done with the game, after getting half way through the first time and onto the third level the second time. It's a bit of a deal breaker for me."

"I know a lot of people really love this game, but after giving it a second try (i dropped it after a couple of hours on the first try) I just can't keep playing it.

My main issues with the game is that it's an arena shooter, and i really don't like those, it's just one closed arena after another with waves of enemies, that gets boring pretty fast, also it has the worst addition ever to any FPS, the fucking glory kills, because QTE are fun right?

The gunplay is fun, the movement is ok but I have the double jump and ledge climbing sucks, that alone with those glory kills ruins the flow of the shooting, also there are way too much platforming between ""arenas"", with no real enemies which just serves as a dumb intermission between fights.

The whole game has this very ""videogame"" feel to it, it has challenges, upgrades, secrets, another type of upgrades, ""trials"" which are just bonus stages with a lame reward, and some collectibles, at least to me all those things in a Doom game feels so weird and wrong.

The original 2 Doom games are classic retro FPS, with labyrinthic level design, secrets to be found (but in no way ""mandatory""), with clever enemy, ammo and weapon placement, not just some arenas with a bunch of enemies spawning one after another, to me at least are much better games, and this game really is something completely different.

In the end, I know a lot of time has passed since this game came out, but I know that to some of the fans of the original 2 Doom games this piece can serve as a warning before buying, it would have helped me at least"
trash
Doom eternal is galaxyes better than this
"Move to a room, get locked in, clear it, room unlocks, move onto the next room. 
This is literally the whole game."
Not enough killing demons. Too much fluffed gameplay.
could be better
"Amazing mechanics and movement. Boring Story, repetitive and frankly a chore to play through"
"Game is quite good, but random lockups and save file corruptions."
Game's rather boring :| And PvP just sucks
Mindlessly fun game but that annoying beep every time the player double jumps is enough for me to straight up stop playing entirely.
"As much as I like to Rip & Tear, this game has me in tears,
The game takes well over minutes to load, Huge load times, Corrupted save game files and what not.
You're better off getting a cracked version of this game. 

Steam Version - 6/10 | Cracked Version - 9/10"
"no online co-op, wtf. bad."
"Reviews mention how there is no story and how that doesn't matter in this game: it's one of those memes that keep popping up. Why then do you get stuck in elevators listening to godafwul exposition over and over again? I don't really understand the hype for the action either if I'm being honest. Not all that fun, this game!"
"Doom 2020 is one of my favorite games, so I bought this to fill my hunger for more doom and what an absolute shit fest this one is. Almost fell asleep on hard mode until they decide to ramp it up to fucking 11 at the very end on a level where you literally get stuck on everything."
"Do NOT buy this game. It started off an excellent looking game, which now I am unable to finish. First and foremost, I am not a great player and had this game set on the easiest setting. All was playing well until I reached the end of level baddie at the Necropolis (level 11 of 13). Let me explain ...

1) You CANNOT save this game manually. You have to rely on Checkpoints.
2) When you die, you go back to the start of that checkpoint.
3) I tried about ten times to beat the end of Necropolis, but always died.
4) So, I enabled the DEV CHEAT to get past that section.  This I did, and after reaching a new level exited the game.
5) Now, trying to reload that game, it says it is corrupted.

So, not only could I NOT save the game as I required, but its own save game facility has corrupted my ONLY save game when I went to load it.

A complete waste of time and money, as it was difficult for me to even reach the stage I had. I do not have the stamina to go through that again.

"It's boring. Most of the time i'm running around looking for the door or the stupid parkour section i missed. fights are stupid, because you have to punch blinking enemies to get hp and chainsaw enemies for ammo. wtf?
Also dumb quicktime events and unskippable ingame sequences to tell boring story. The whole game feels too slow.
Game looks pretty good though and runs well."
Trash. Doesn't even start.
I can't play it without severe motion sickness.
"I'm not a man who enjoys playing first person shooters. They generally come down to the same generic formula of run and gun around the map, point, and click. So much so that they can be called point and clickers as interchangeably as FPS's. I consider these games to not really allow for much critical thinking beyond that or adaptability to different playstyles which I think a game should do, the one's I really enjoy the most are immersive sims and horror one's that actually force you to use your thought process and not pure instinct. 
Never the less I enjoy these kind of games as low class as they are. So I saw the game on sale and said ""Alright let's see how the successor to the original most influential fps plays.""
Big mistake, my most regrettable purchase yet, I might just start pirating games before buying them to see if they're worth spending money on after this.
Listen very carefully because I'm going to get to the point and explain exactly why I can't recommend this game:
It literally glitched out my save files.
This has never happened to me before, the worst thing close to this that had ever happened to me was looping myself in death because I autosaved while dying on the one save file I had while playing SS2. That was my fault, this wasn't. 
Bethesda games are glitchy in general sure, but this took the cake, I can handle dropping out of the map, I can't when I open up the game and see that I had been sent back in time all the way to where you meet the first Imp.
You had one job.
One job.
And you still screwed the pooch.
That's not just it though.
Doom isn't a conventional FPS because of glory kills, the game makes you spam the shit out of whatever key you binded them to to get health and supplies. Last I checked no other fps makes you focus on this.
The gameplay apart from that is your basic fps, run in an arena map for 5 minutes until everything dies, move to the next level. 
This isn't a plus or minus, it just means that the gameplay is literally meaningless here because you can get the same experience anywhere else. 
The story, oh God the story. Remember that Doom comic that was cartoonish in it's portrayal of Doom guy and how he was just some maniac obsessed with killing everything?  Imagine reading that and taking it seriously as something the fanbase enjoyed and wasn't just some ironic injoke. In the original Doom you were the last survivor of a horrible event, contrary to what the future games tell you, they're not locked in there with you, you're locked in there with them, Doom Guy, Gordon Freeman, Adrian Shepherd were all made badasses because they were normal people like you or me who pushed their limits to survive. Nowadays every single protagonist has to be a Jesus stand in who gets worshipped as the second coming from the start. Yeah Half Life 2 did it first but still they didn't hammer it in as hard as this, until Alyx.
Alyx lore wise just ruined everything but that's a whole other story.
Point being it's laughable that this became the actual story for Doom. 
Mick Gordon's soundtrack is great but all video game soundtracks are great, there's no shortage of musician majors who can't get jobs or make it as performers so they just compose video game music, even indie games have great orchestral scores now, if you think this is going to raise the games level in anyway it doesn't.
Going back the save file disappearance I have seen other games screw up with hitboxing and guns but never anything like this. The game fundamentally managed to fail at a formula that has already been set and one that sets the bar at the lowest in gaming. 
Given all these negatives with no real positives I'm going to just have to say the game isn't worth the buy. 
Go buy Deus Ex, or System Shock, or even the original Doom even if it costs as much as this game does on sale. It's not worth the buy."
Extremely boring game. Finished campaign. Spent most of the time spamming the Glory Kill to watch the same 2 animations on each enemy. Waypoint system isnt great either.
"every aspect of this game is Incredibly underwhelming, this would be a passable game at most IF it was priced at 4 Pounds/Dollars"
"Not violent enough.
This is not a gag."
"Not my cup of tea.  Dark, disorientating and didn't enjoy the game play at all."
Terrible slow thru steam
"It's got a lot of the classic Doom flavor. (Although not as much of the sheer inanity that they managed to sneak into Doom Eternal.) However, I didn't find myself really enjoying the gameplay or the story all that much. (Possibly because there is a story now, and it hinges around the moral ambiguity of solving an energy crisis with Hell-demons.) I guess the Glory Kills are a neat touch.

Between this and Doom Eternal, Eternal offers a more robust experience built around much of the same material. (And aside from knowing a little bit about the UAC and Doctor Hayden, you don't miss much.) If you're going to play both, play this first; the story is continuous. Doom Eternal just has more gymnastics and wall climbing. If you're not going to play both, play Doom Eternal. 

Since each one is about 60 gigs, maybe only install both at once if you have a pretty big hard drive."
"This is Doom for the modern gamer, that doesn't actually like old school shooters. It's painfully new-school, uninspired; You can tell that it was designed to use naive gamers as a conduit for hype.

Any claims that this is an ""authentic"" or ""evolved"" Doom game is a smokescreen. If you actually want authentic, buy a New Blood game instead."
"I find this game boring. Levels look the same, enemies are mweh.. jsut press f to fuck them up... nope."
Game is fast past and has an old school feel to it. But the game is just killing the same hordes of demons over and over again in different rooms. I had some problems where demons would teleport and get stuck inside walls which forced me to reload a check point and the single player crashed once with a disconnection error.
"You could remove a lot of its parts and it would still work fine. I don't really see the pure ""RIP AND TEAR"" experience others had with it."
You cannot eat food
"not my bag, gore is lame and cliche, great story telling if you like mind-numbing brain hurting lame and cliche yeah"
i have a nightmare from this game scary oh no
"Hoped it's more like Doom2 (more shooting, less searching), but it's like Doom3, but less scary."
"I really enjoyed this game but I am going to not recommend it because there is a bug related to a certain achievement that still has not been fixed since its release in 2016. this bug was acknowledged by the developers a few weeks after release and they said they were going to fix but have not done so. 

Absolutely worth buying if you don't care about achievements."
"personally, I like bashing demon skulls into walls as much as the next guy but after not too long of playing it got really repetitive.

Sure I could have done the challenges or look for the collectibles but that just makes it even more boring, I've already play the game through on switch so maybe that's why I found it boring to play through it again but to me at least i got desensitized way too quickly and it has long fights multiple times with little cut-scenes or breaks between. 4/10"
"No manual save/load, only checkpoints. Died once? Go play most of the level from the start.
Want to try another approach and died again? Go play most of the level from the start.
Faced boss and died? Go play from the level start."
"The game was ok until level 89 then it locked out/froze and would not go to any other level in fact the whole program stopped responding, tried to uninstall and reinstall in steam to no avail, somewhat frustrating with nowhere to go to fix what ever the problem is"
"Game is fun and everything but is poorly optimized, it keeps crashing. I have brand new custom made PC, so the only reason left for crashing is poorly developed game. I wish i could take my money back.."
"Combat is propped up by a repetitive glory kill mechanic that takes me out of the action and ruins immersion. The controls are clunkier than the original Halo, things like ledge grabs seem to only connect half the time. Only an hour in and I'm spending minutes walking to 30 second combat encounters against uninspired enemies that die to bullet spam (playing on medium difficulty btw)."
Pay Mick Gordon.
"To difficult on the easiest level. If I wanted difficult I will play the harder levels. I play for fun not to be annoyed. Game does not allow invincibility or unlimited ammo. Getting past the ""Argent Facility (destroyed)"" is not fun... so the game is gone and am not planing on getting any future versions of Doom again. Not for me."
"I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend this game based on something as random as video settings. It sounds silly but I just cannot LOOK at the game comfortably. Borderless window mode doesn't actually work - the game still takes overlay priority over other windows I have open that are supposed to show up over the game.  Windowed mode takes the resolution you specified but shrinks the sides and the bottom. I don't want to play full screened if I'm supposed to have 2 other options.

In-game HUD and subtitle text are somewhat blurry even with sharpness all the way up. It drove me nuts. Actual enemies and objects looked okay.

The soundtrack was hype though."
"4/10

got soft-locked in mission 10 and the game isn't fun enough to replay the entire mission again so fuck off"
"I find this version of Doom to be disappointing and quite boring. I much prefer Doom 3 over this version. This has nothing in the way of story compared to it. All you do is jump from one arena to the next to the next ad nauseum. 

Olivia Pierce is barely a Villain and Samuel Hayden guiding you along is annoying at best. 

That's not to mention all the technical problems I have just getting it to play. Frequently the audio will just cut between loading screens, I have to switch the Resolution from 1440p to 1080 in Windows before I launch the game otherwise it'll freeze and then I get random freezes for no reason causing me to have to reboot my entire system.

Never had an issue playing an older game on modern hardware as I have with this. Got it because I eventually wanted to play Doom Eternal and this is its predecessor.

The RPG elements when it comes to upgrades feels tacked on and really don't belong in a Doom game. Collectible figurines add nothing besides bragging points for completionists.

Already uninstalled and I'll be skipping Eternal."
holy shit i remember playing this game and it was fun but if you have played into the game atleast 30 hours you see alot of the problems the first one is that there is no sort of invulernability after getting a glory kill so that can make the game much more frustrating due to the enemies firing fireballs or rockets at you to only hit you right after you finish a glory kill and sure im not someone who plays fps games alot but i know that good ones have way less issues then this i hope that if you are buying this you know just how dogshit the mechanics for this game are thank you for reading my review
This is one of the most fooouuooocking pointless games i've every played in my life. Its hypnotic in the worst possible way. You do the same crap over levels of repetitiveness for 7-16 hours. Its just like what Mack said from WAB: A mindless shooter. Repetitive = Chore = Bad.
"- Very good game!
- Has in-game Ads."
"Used to be a great game, then some update made controller impossible to use, with motion sense as if it was some kind of VR thing, making aiming a chore."
"Bad level design, boring action. It's more about searching where to go than actually shooting enemies."
Spend  most of time walking around
"This was my first Doom game after hearing about it, so I had very high expectations, which means I was naturally disappointed. I would have refunded the game, but I got it dirt cheap on the winter sale, so I don’t care.

+The music is pretty nice I guess. I'm partial to orchestral music in games, but I can appreciate this too. 
+The glory kills are kinda satisfying.
+The game looks very beautiful, even on lower settings. 
+The demon destruction physics are super good.

~The guns are pretty unique, but only after you upgrade them. Until then, they feel very similar.
~The runes make for good extra perks, but the rooms you have to complete aren’t even remotely challenging. It would be much better if you just got them straight away.

The gunplay is terrible. I'm gonna break it down into a few parts:
-I hate that I can't reload. For me, it breaks the flow of the game, I need some way to ""recenter"" myself, break the fight into multiple parts instead of one big one and actually enjoy it, instead of rushing through it.
-For some reason, there’s no ADS. Only a single weapon has a zoomed sight. I miss like 60% of my shots because my gun is always on my hip.
-The encounters are very fast and very short. There are also huge intervals in between them, especially paired with the ""secrets"". There aren't any “just wandering"" enemies spread out on the map.
-The fight begins incredibly epic, one guy versus the horde. But always ends with one little shit, stuck in the geometry of the level.
-The guns all feel very weak, it always takes so much more to kill something than I think (I played on medium difficulty). Also if I’m the Doom hunter shouldn’t I have overpowered weapons? 
-There is no reward after the fight, not even spawned armor for example, if you kill everything. At that point, the fights feel like an annoying obstacle more than fun.
-The game boils down to just shoot an enemy with your peashooter out in the open until you can glory kill them and then move on to the next enemy. That’s the entire gameplay loop, it doesn’t change at all.  

My other criticisms:
-The “secrets” aren’t secret, you can see them on your map when you get close. They’re really more “points of interest”.
-The “POI” are really the main reason why I got bored so quickly. To get better weapons, you need to collect them, which makes a game that’s already heavily segmented feel even more so. They often require a lot of going outside the mainline of fights, where there is nothing at all. 
-The map is garbage, especially on levels that have multiple floors.
-The environment is uninspired and doesn’t change, it’s all just a generic industrial base. 
-The parkour, or more specifically mantling is very random. Sometimes you can’t make trivial jumps and other times you make a jump when the platform is a meter above you.


TL:DR: The game looks nice, but starts getting boring after just a few minutes when you get the basic gameplay loop. There’s no ADS or reloading. The fights are short and have a lot of time between them. IMO I would say that this game is insanely overrated for how much hype it gets.

TL:DR the TL:DR: This game is basically the boring 18+ version of Ratchet and Clank."
I want DOOM to be a shooter; I just don't get on with the melee / glory kill focus.
"It's atmospheric and the theme is amazing but it feels repetitive and tiresome to me, I wouldn't recommend it based on that."
Locked at 60 FPS...
its fun until like 6 hours and then it gets kinda bland
"Other people obviously like this game and this is a classic game that anyone calling themself a ""gamer"" should at least attempt to experience but personally i found it bland and boring. Game play is ok and the story is fine but the art style is next to non existant and everything kinda blended together so nothing really stood out too much. Sorry"
honestly I had high hopes for this game but it constantly freezes in the loading screens Its super annoying because the actual game is fun but I constantly have to restart my pc
"Like someone said: Either you fall in love with this game or you stop playing it immediately. It's very much down to personal taste.
So many people claim it's the best shooter evar but no-one mentions that it's so very, very, very obviously a console, not a PC game. I'm not exaggerating when I say everything about this game feels console to me. ""What's the difference between a PC and a console game"" you ask? It's the difference between Deus Ex 1 and Deus Ex 2.
So if you love simple, action-packed pseudo-oldschool shooters and don't mind console game UI, console game world design, console game weapon design and feel and console game arcade-y gameplay on your PC, you'll probably love it. Reminds me of the recent Wolfenstein 1 & 2, which everyone claimed were the best FPS evar too and when I played them on PC I though: ""These games are good, but if you claim they're the best evar you obviously never played a shooter that was made for PC instead of consoles or multi-platform (which is another word for console-first)"".
If you're an oldschool PC gamer like me and don't like giant-ass crosshairs on monster size weapons and gamepad-focussed UIs and menues, learn from my mistake and don't buy this game and then wait a month before you actually play it so you can't get a refund if it turns out that you're just not the target audience for this simple console arcade shooter."
"I'm sure this game is great, and I would actually kill a person to play it but sadly, whatever copy of DOOM I got is completely broken. I can't get past like the first two minutes of gameplay without it freezing or crashing. Iv'e reinstalled multiple times, Iv'e done basically all I can at this point. I'm sure I would love it if I got to play it but I can't recommend something that is undoubtedly broken. :("
"So far when I try to restart every single saved game it comes up as a corrupted file. I don't have time for this crap. I'll still play it, but it's a few bucks I'll never get back. Recommend it to other players? No way."
Doom eternal ripoff
multiplayer dead
"I've spent 14 hours in this game but have never gotten that far into the game due to my saves corrupting eventually every time I try to play. Honestly, this game is really good. However, it keeps crashing on me and subsequently corrupting my saves.  I've tried my hardest to try and fix these issues, because I have had a good time in the parts of the game I've experienced. Nothing's worked however, and honestly I've given up and chalked it up to a hardware problem. I've had a bittersweet experience with this game, but it doesn't mean that you'll have the same one as me. I can't personally in good faith give it a recommendation, but you'll probably have a good time with it. Pick it up, but be wary of any issues you may face."
"Game worked for a total of two days with about 2ish hours spent playing Campaign. Now it doesn't even launch, showing only a fullscreen black screen and displaying as ""Not Responding"" in task manager. Waste of money."
"I played Doom growing up, and I saw how highly rated this game was, so I bought it a while ago. I don't get what all the hype and excitement is about, it feels like a pretty formulaic shooter where you navigate labyrinth levels, do some first person jumping puzzles, then have big set piece battles with a variety of weapons and enemies. Certainly a polished game, but also kind of boring (the same formula for almost 30 years). Maybe I was just expecting something more or different, but I kept waiting for the fun to happen and for the game to get it's hooks in me."
Game is really good but for some reason my save files keeps getting corrupted and game crashes.
"PROS:

Runs incredibly well, was able to maintain a consistent ~160FPS on max settings at 1080p.
Looks pretty good.

CONS:

Rather short campaign.
Boring core gameplay loop.
The music gets annoying after a while.

But the real reason I leave a negative review is the excessive amount of bugs I encountered in the last two levels of the game, which completely soured my otherwise ""not for me but a decent game"" sentiment. Almost every surface or staircase was causing a huge snag (or sometimes causing a physics glitch that made my character catapult as if I used a jump pad) and even locking me in place at times. Additionally, finishers were causing me to fall through the map or also get stuck in place.

For those reasons I cannot recommend this title, as these bugs became easy to reproduce and hard to avoid at what would be well past the point of a simple Steam refund in terms of hours played."
T
Lame and boring. Wasn't a big fan of the original Doom back in '93 but it was a must back then.
"i hope eternal is better than this sh*t, so boring one of my easiest refunds"
"what do you get when you take repetitive gameplay, uninteresting story, and one dimensional characters mixed with gay ass dubstep music in the background? this GARBAGE!  seriously, what happened to blasting some Slayer like a real man???? not only are the guns unrealistic (shotguns don't have infinite ammo and you need to reload guns to shoot them), it lags my computer too! ridiculous!"
"I love everything about the DOOM franchise, but the game just doesn't launch.
I don't know how to fix it, it's unplayable."
"So, I'm revising this review from when I first tried DOOM (when I noted that I found it unplayably hard due to its ""getting into the middle of things"" game design). I've come back to it, and managed to get through the first few missions - 3 hours of gameplay - and.... well, it's still not exactly great.

I'm still not a fan of glory kills - there's much better implementations of the risk/reward system in other games - and I'm not really a fan of the level design principles either (""lets lock people into a series of small arenas or pseudo-arenas"" and ""lets have a lot of *very rectangular* corridors which you can only find your way around because they put green lights on where you should go"").  The combat is disinteresting enough to me that I tried the first Rune challenge once, shrugged and couldn't be bothered to try it again - it doesn't help that Runes were yet *another* upgrade point system on top of the, what, three that already had been introduced? 1 upgrade point system, sure. 4 seems like carelessness.
And the fact that you're locked into a checkpoint system with no free saves and yet the game wants to try to get you to explore to find secrets - which could involve attempting jumps that would kill you and... send you back to a checkpoint nowhere near where you'd gotten to - is baffling.

The music's great, but I'm going back to Quake."
"game is not compatable with my system. spent 6.3 hrs trying to fix d problem. 
it launches but crashes b4 d game loads up."
Miss sniper-style gameplay. You can only play in brutal close in style.
"updated this review after a few years, game kinda sucks actually, want to get into it but just cant, play doom eternal"
Can not get game to run. All I see is black screen with 99% at top right. Music plays in background
"my computer crashed [spoiler] when I got back to the hell 3rd time [/spoiler] and now my file is corrupted. I don't want to spent another 15 hours to get back to the point I was.

can not even import savefiles and use mission select"
I could hardly play the game because I kept headbanging to the music 0/10
"I somehow failed to enjoy this game at all, I was just bored from beginning to end. I might be broken."
"i will now list everything wrong with the game that i have found so far:
1: bethesda touched it
2: inconsistant/borderline non-existant hitboxes makes game frustrating at best and unplayable at worst
3: the map design looks amazing but is almost impossible to navigate without a qualifaction in navigation
4: the UI is garbage and pisses me off just a persinal thing i hate how you have to navigate it
5: glory kills give fuck all hp back there is bassicaly no point to using it since your more likly to burn through more hp getting to the enemy and stunning said enemy than your going to get back from the glory kill
6: the maps are a pain in the ass to move around and there is no soft vault at all so the slightest ledge will stop you in you tracks
good things:
1: a good sound track (dont bother getting the game just buy the soundtrack that is actually good)"
No saving possible. Checkpoints only. Game has a panicky feel without any of the DOOM DNA. This is not DOOM. Waste of money. Delete. Bye.
"It's very Quake style. Not really ""Doom-ish"" . If you like never-ending mass shootings for several hours - buy it."
"Absolute disappointment!
Cant understand the hype. Boring, linear, dull, clunky and repetitive...
Feels more like someone needed money and that, as fast as possible.
It had a potential but was just trashed. 
The map design looks cheap and the enemies animation and effects are just weird.
This sucks"
"Neutral review.

This is a great game ruined by bad UI. the waypoint system in this game is unintuitive at best and the maps it gives you to work with are not that much better. game pace is ruined when i have to scour empty rooms looking for a single key because the waypoint is telling me the actual door i need to go through is 4 rooms away from me through 8 walls for a good 10-15 minutes at a time. if nothing else, at least put the key icon on the minimap instead of the 30 random collectables i don't care about which all clutter the screen. Raw gameplay, this game is good though [shield enemies are obnoxious, but basically everything else i found to be okay]. Overall, the game's fine, but the map layouts and UI to match are just so god damn obnoxious."
"Finally decided to give it a try, and it's as bland and boring as I expected."
"This game made me feel as amazing as the original did.

But... then I played Doom Eternal, and I can't touch this one now."
"Kind of tedious.  When you get stuck there's no level select, few cheat codes.  Annoying checkpoint system that reeks of  being a console port."
i want a refund now. u took my money in a second u can put it back in a second. your game wont work. and that means a refund
"Broken buggy game with terrible movement, dumb ai, and boring encounters.
If you must play one of the new doom games get eternal as its somehow less buggy and broken than this piece of shit while still being terribly broken."
Big Dick and Balls
"Seriously overhyped, the game is fine I guess but incredibly repetitive and gets boring pretty quick. Despite all the ""intensity"" it really boils down to forcing a very specific playstyle that requires the player to shoot enemies a bit, then do a melee attack to finish them off (this is optional but you will quickly run out of health and ammo if you don't) resulting in the player watching the same animations over and over again while your control is pulled away so that doomguy can perform one of a handful of scripted animations. Levels look neat but aren't well designed and get confusing. 

Play Wolfenstein instead, same appeal, better game."
"I bought this game thankfully only for 5€. Friends of me were searching for a somewhat unreal tournament/quake 3 arena like feeling like in the good old days of multiplayer gaming. 

Well the first impression of the game was ok. Felt a little bit like an old style shooter but then came the downs...

- Complete senseless matchmaking. No filter for game type. We liked warpath the most as gamemode. But no filter for that. You can only filter for a pool of game modes where warpath for example is in, but it is possible that you will play the whole evening other game types. Great job devs.

- No balanced team joins or scramble. Well there is a server mode for the first 20 levels. That is a nice. And the games there were the most fun. So it was about the first 1 or 2 hours of the game. But after then, you do your first ""real"" games and gets thrown in against a clan team of fully max leveld ""super heroes"" with all weapons and stuff. Good luck with your first guns and 2 hours of map experience. 
What the hell were the devs thinking ? So you wonder why player count drops?
Well i tell you what, if every newcomer who maybe has a slight interest in the game, but only lands as cannonfodder (after joining a match with a gamemode he does not even want to play) because he has a job and does not want to get pulverized every 2 seconds from ""no job school boy who leveled the game 24/7"" then you can be assure the pleasure is somewhere at the bottom.

Imagine you learn to play chess, and you buy a chess game but the chess game puts you just randomly against players with hundreds of hours of gameplay. Will it be fun ? A newbie against Kasparov maybe ? Great idea. Great job again devs.

- No server browser is bad. But matchmaking without trying to balance teams is the worst you can do in a game.

- There are also more minor to medium ""issues"" which do not fit, like demons which are starting way to often, which leads to games where always a demon is on. Etc.

- You can also create own games, but then you can not select bots for every game mode.

- Instead of a sensible matchmaking or serverbrowser you get now experience points for achieve skins for your right arm or left leg(no joking). wtf ?

Like i said, for 5€ ok, played two evenings and good bye. Thank got i did not spent 40 or more for this dissapointment."
"Deleted hours of progress without reason, I never had that issue on console. It's nice that it loads fast but that doesn't make up for the time I'll have to spend redoing what it deleted. There's also oddly no fps option, and it's crashed numerous times for seemingly no reason. Once so bad I had to ctrl alt delete and sign out to force close everything because I couldn't click on anything on my desktop."
trash
"Game almost never loads fully, ryzen 5 2600 with kraken m22 runs 95c even at menu.  original doom you could play on any x86 system.  waste of money."
"Sry, for me I can't recommended this game.
I play it through and test the arcade mode, but none of these modes are quite fun for me.

Pros:
- Performance with activated vulkan api is awesome and very fluent
- Controls are absolutely perfect
- Not much time is spent to the weak story
- Sound, graphics and animation are very good

Cons:
- Gameplay is some kind of weak, because of the following game breaking issues:
- Gunplay, some weapons doesn't feel good and the impact feels not right
- Ammo, you have very restricted ammo, still in the arcade mode
- Wayfinding, you are always searching the next checkpoint and this means: walking, searching, looking at the map, walking, searching, and the whole thing from the beginning, until you find the trigger. This was one of the most annoying thing of the game for me.
- The second one is: Doom is an Arena Mode Game, an area is sealed until you killed the last deamon, which are spawning, it's a lame style to play a game and there is no other play mode.
- The monotonous music can be annoying, I finally muted it.
- Glory Kills, can disturb the flow of the game and for me they are annoying in this type
- The game is a little bit too fast to enjoy it

Well, everybody has to judge for himself. For me I have more fun with the classic doom games for myself and don't have the intension to play the sequel of this doom game."
im rash so i dont like jk i love dis game
"it crashed too much, I can't have a nice gaming session on it."
"I was thrilled, i bought this game and it was all good for 9 hours of gameplay, until i reach an area where there should be a big explosiong and... boom the game freezes everytime i get there, very disappointing"
"The game itself is great but I can't wholehearty recommend this game because the recent, very detailed event that Mick Gordon have provided to the public of how he got treated and have shed some light on his side of the story.

Marty need to get rip a new one"
save corrupted no fix thanks guys loved it a lot until this don't feel like putting another 8 hours in to get back where I was
The game crashes everytime I start it up. Once I load in I have no issues but as it boots its a gamble whether or not it'll work. The game itself is fun but I cant give a good review when it clearly seems to have many issues after looking online seeing how many people have this same issue four years after launch.
"GTX 1070, 48 gb Ram and AMD Ryzen 7 1700x @3.4 Mhz. Running 12-13 FPS. Are you kidding me? A year ago everything when smooth on ultra settings. Now, not even on Low Setting can I play this game..."
"I think the new Doom games are highly over-rated. I would have had so much more fun if this game had iron sights, and I didnt have to melee enemies for health. The OLD dooms are better in terms of just raw fun and door/key puzzles. I really wish they would have just made it like the OLD first 2 dooms, but with these new graphics, I feel like that would have been way more fun."
"bug infested piece of shit. i've been trying to solve the ""doom refusing to launch on my main screen"" problem for hours. I remember playing it. the game itself is not that bad. but these fucking bugs have me at my wits end."
it makes sense for me to put a bad review beaucause i have a terrible computer
"Extremely Boring, repetitive, predictable and confusing. Half the time you’re trying to find some keycard in a maze of copy and pasted rooms and half the time your having to glory kill some annoying imp that keeps spawning in over and over again. The weapons have hardly any ammo capacity and always run out of ammo extremely fast and don’t do hardly any damage. The difficulty settings are terrible, the game is either too easy or too hard. The menu makes no sense and the game tries so hard to have fancy graphics that half the time you can’t even tell what you’re looking at. 0/10, not worth being paid to play."
"Has women in it

0/10"
"from the little bit i played it did not grip me. I was playing a 2002 game called enclave before this (which never had high ratings btw) which is kinda similar in that you can shoot or do melee and imo way more fun. This seems more of a melee game than a shooter really. you stun your enemy by shooting it, walk up to it and rip its head off. looks cool on youtube but it did not make for a super satisfying gameplay loop. more fun melee systems have been done many times before.  Here It's like harvesting. instead of tomatoes, you are harvesting heads. also i did not really get the 'red planet' aesthetic of this game, despite the graphics being good. i might adjust my score later if and when i play more, but for now i cant recommend it."
Glory kills ruined the game.
"The glory kill system ruined this game for me. 

When I shoot a throw away enemy like a zombie or an imp at close range with the shotgun I want it to fly in five different directions not go into a awkward stumble animation, glow orange and then patiently wait for me to punch it. You can turn off the glow but not the mechanic.

The game already has an annoyingly small ammo pool. Leaving the player with the options of either watching the same boring animation again and again or wasting twice as much of their precious ammo.

I replay OG DOOM 1 & 2 all the time and have never wanted to replay this piece of crap.

Download brutal doom and have more fun for free than this can provide."
Poop
"I’m astounded how overrated and boring this game is.

Combat: Sparse ammo, meh weapons, meh enemies, forced melee (your shooting galore is interrupted every 5 seconds so that you perform a “glory kill” to regain health and/or ammo).
Level design: Maze > locked arena > maze > locked arena. No atmosphere or environmental storytelling whatsoever, just “compounds” and “facilities” with occasional (bad) platforming.
Story: There were NPCs spewing BS and I haven’t ever cared less.
Soundtrack: Some people say it’s “good” and “metal”. It’s neither good nor metal.

I’ve spent 4 euros to see what’s the hype all about and now I’m giving you this “avoid” lesson for free:)"
"I really liked this game until it randomly gave me a BSOD when I changed graphics settings and restarted. When I started the game again, the save was corrupted. I lost all my progress."
"this game crushes so much so i had to walk it through 3 times because 2 of my saves were corrupted during its crashes. i have to restart it after almost each load. no other game allows itself to behave same way. i am very-very disappointed in id software, their previous games had all pretty good quality. this is just glossy chinese shit"
It's dead.
no
"Game overstayed its welcome by 4-5 hours.
Please stop spamming my recommendations with Demon games, Steam."
"A neutral review rather than negative, singleplayer only.

✔️ High tempo music and bloody gore as expected
❌ Unbefittingly slow movement and weapons (unlike Quake games)
✔️ Great graphics, animations, physics
❌ Poor environmental variety

✔️ Melee kills are useful throughout the game (unlike Serious Sam 3&4) 
✔️ Good equipment implementation (recharging instead of pickups, separate from weapons) 
❌ Too few equipment types and weapons (unlike Shadow Warrior 2)
❌ Weapons lack impact (plasma rifle and rocket launcher) and it wasn't clear to me until the last level that half of them use the same ammo
❌ Power-up placement and visibility (80% of time I found those only after combat)"
"The in-game experience is pretty fun, and feels slick and polished. Overall real good gameplay. However, the crazy DRM, privacy policy and T&C's make this a hard product to recommend anyone. Put simply, they are unreasonable. 

As a funny example, if your steam name is 'ugly Gilgamesh' then you technically violate their code of conduct (username with offensive wording with a historical figure) and might lose access to the game if they choose to enforce their own policies -- which they will certainly do when it is convenient."
Still as glitchy as it was a launch.
"Punchy, satisfying, and gory game-play progresses into slow, boring monotony just before the 3rd act. 

Endless corridors of the same red and brown hues, with 1-dimensional enemies thrown at you in ever increasing numbers. 

Shared ammo meaning that you can never use your favourites for long enough, and under-powered starting weapons mean you are actually limited in what you can use. 

Add to that clunky platforming, useless suit upgrades, and a spattering of secret areas, which are the only thing remotely interesting about the later levels, you have a pretty ""meh"" game."
"Disapointingly lacking in content and replayability. Very few collectables, and the ones that do exist have no life to them. Its really quite disapointing and I very much regret spending my $20 on this. I thought it would have more content for how well it did back in 2016, but it seems I was mistaken. 
Some games I would reccomend. Rainbow six siege, great multiplayer shooter and you get more value for what you pay.
Binding of Isaac Rebirth, tons of content and literally the most replayable game ever being a roguelike.

Really a shame, glad most of this was fixed in the sequel but there is absolutely no point in buying or playing doom 2016 in 2020 unless you have an obsession with challange runs. Pretty disapointing... 
Anyways hope this helped!"
"The problem isn't dying, it's getting lost"
too scary; gave me nightmares
good atmostphere nice graphics but stale and repetative gameplay.
"Dont bother,the game will not even open.The doom console will have a error and will refuse to open the game"
Boring. Very boring. Just stupid shooter. Far from Doom III
"Where should I begin? 

This game lacks feeling..
Weapons have no feeling, they are quite literally click and shoot. Doesn't feel like shooting at all. 
Movement is the same way, you have no feel for it either. Can hardly even hear my own foot steps. Using Muffle and sneaking in Skyrim makes more noise for fucks sake.
You get hit, but that doesn't feel either. Your health and armor just diminishes. 
Eventually you'll die as some random imp, or even some ""Baron of Hell"", was tearing you apart, as you had simply no way of telling via sound, or any kind of feeling where from. Imagine having huge as Mancubus behind you, shooting at you, and only way you know it's there is by looking that way..
Lockdown here, lockdown there, and only way to deal with them is always the same ritual.. Go to pod (or what ever it was) to piss off demons, non-stop run and shoot demons till the game stops spawning them.. Kinda gets boring after few of those. 
The lockdown areas are so recognizable, symmetrical, and in a shape what reminds you of Unreal Tournament.

Wish it was still the case of ""You're stuck with demons in mars."""
"HDR does not work at all, the game disables it on launch therefore if you only have a hdr monitor like me you will have to play in black and white, can't say anything else because im not playing a game in black and white and btw no tech support people can figure it out either."
The game is over hyped and is pretty boring .
"Very disappointing. Coming from Doom 3 with its few but scary monsters, slow paced survival horror atmosphere, this game feels like Quake with bots, it's basically an arcade zombie shooter. You just run around bunny hopping and blasting tons of hell spawns. In half hour I lost all interest in what's going on in the game, you just get to checkpoints and kill monsters. I regret that I can't refund it because it was purchased by a 3rd party store. Hope Doom Eternal isn't done in the same manner
Edit: After forcing myself to finish the game, I still can't recommend it. Gets repetitive very quickly, I wished there were more puzzles or anything to challenge your mind, instead of endless monsters in which aspect I guess it does alright. But it's just mindless shooting. The secrets or challenges are often impossible, even after exploring every way, I still had to look up secrets on google. And this comes from a player that completed a lot of puzzle related games in the past.
The achievements are also locked behind grinding or multiplayer which is dead. Same as the game"
4 years later and some bugs still aren't fixed(like argent tower ending locking up)
"I feel a good description of why I don't recommend this is  ""Louder does not mean better.""

It's decent, with blights of action that seem awesome, It seems as it's still new it'll be a controversial take to say it really does not have the ""soul"" or ""spirit"" of the original DOOM'92. It'll be a nice action experience to turn your brain off and forget about and say you had fun in a couple parts. It's small attempt at a dynamic story seems very uncomplimentary as the tiny moments of action then followed by slugs or corridors and puzzles is just a grind fest for some meaningless dialogue for a less meaningful cliffhanger ending.

DOOM isn't back with explosions and roars like it seemed to be presented as when this released. I would personally suggest trying GZDOOM if you have been hooked on this game being the fast paced, high action shooter it unfortunately is not."
"Yes this game is amazing and everyone should have it. But I'm leaving a negative review for the time being to bring light to an inexcusable issue.

If you have a controller plugged in, (or if the game thinks you do, which frequently happens) the game doesn't 100% properly utilize keyboard functionality. In particular, you can't switch weapons using the Weapon Wheel, you can't choose which Runes you want to equip, the map controls aren't quite right, and all of the in-game HUD/UI will display controller inputs instead of keyboard inputs. This problem can be solved by forcing Steam to hide your controller, (right-click on the game in your library and choose Properties and change Steam Input Per Game to Force Off.) but for people who actually do want use a controller sometimes, this means you need to restart the game everytime you want to switch between controller and keyboard. This is inexcusable and there's no reason any PC game made in the last 15 years should have this problem, let alone one with such a high budget."
since steam upgrade the game will not load
would be nice if the loading screens weren't 10 years long

It is below average compared to the other doom games.
"It's okay, but definitely hard sometimes in a ""restart the whole level because I'm not healthy enough to fight the boss now"" or ""restart because I need to grind and upgrade some weapons first"" way.  The Rune trials are also often (not always) extremely tedious--do your best job and keep trying until luck breaks your way.  

Your know how some really hard challenges are fun and others are just kind of grinding work?  This feels like the latter to me.  More stressed after playing than before, and a feeling of wasting time sometimes more than having fun.

A lot of nostalgia value though."
"Its fun, but its plagued with technical issues, the game cant start propertly, alt tab is an instant crash. Its been 4 years, doubt they are planning to fix it. I suggest you to get the console version if you own one and want to play this game. Its a mess on PC."
gud but borin im play this game bored (((
Impossible to beat the game due to corrupt save issues.
The controls for the game are very bad and the story is not interesting so i can never sit down and play for more than a hour before not playing for about a month
"I've played it less than hour. I purchased it from a sale for like 4.5 euros. And perhaps it's not a bad game, but it's just not for me. I was hoping that with all the hype this game has had since it's launch, I'd dig it, but I guess shooters simply aren't for me. So in case you aren't that much into shooters but think you may enjoy this, be aware."
"It starts out ok,  it is fun for a while but then the fact that they make you dance like a trained monkey around and demands that you play the game in a certain way makes it tedious and it looses the charm fast. By the end you only carry on because you put the time in it and want to get it over with."
I put 6 hours in it and got corrupted save file.
"Highly fed up with this one.
Annouced as a glorious comeback, it is only a mere shadow of former DOOM. Ok, it is dynamic, but still ONLY a arena-type shooter - get into the arena, kill certain amount of demons, push a switch, move to another arena. After a few almost exactly same level it's only boring. Advertised ""gory kills"" are fun, at least for a first few times - than again, boring and a waste of time. The only break from arenas is searching for secrets, which require some jumping, most usually. But - during a high-pace arena fights those are easy to miss, and than... the game doesn't allow you to backtrack to them ! So basically forget about 100% complete game in one run. Or restart levels a dozen times, when yo realise you missed something.
Oh, and on top of that - this game has almost NO STORY whasoever - you only run forward and shoot. Hey, it may have worked in the early 90s, but - suprise suprise ! - that was more than twenty years ago ! 
I may be in a sort of minority, but I strongly believe that previous DOOM game - DOOM 3 - was the propper way for the series... this one is only a vintage crap packed in modern, shiny box...

NOT RECOMMENDED at all !!!"
This game is scam. I bought it year ago and then it did not work properly. fuck doom developers
Самый переоцененный шутер десятилетия.
i am dumb and get lost in linear game
"So you've likely heard everyone gushing with praise for this game by now. Well then allow me to be one of the few voices of dissent here. That isn't to say I don't recognize the game's strengths, but I feel it's important that people know some of its weaknesses - and for me personally those weaknesses were infuriating. For context, I played on Ultra-Violence.

[u][b]Pros:-[/b][/u]

1) The Combat: This is what you're here for, and the game definitely wins on this front. The enemies are challenging and varied. I'll just say that the game definitely gives you the old school Doom feel, but now complemented with modern tools for your own character.

2) The Performance: Id has always been known for top notch engine optimization, and they deliver again here. I also haven't come across any bug so far, so their reputation for polish is well deserved.

3) The Soundtrack: This is actually a departure from how previous Doom games sounded, but it suits the new feel. It's subdued when traversing the areas, but then dials up during pitched encounters.

4) Classic Maps: Each level of the game also has a hidden secret classic Doom map unlock, rendered in the same old school graphics. Once unlocked, you can play through them at your leisure. Nice touch!

5) Snapmap: Pretty nifty custom level designer.

[u][b]Cons:-[/b][/u] So what could possibly be wrong if the game runs smooth and combat feels great? Well, this will come down to personal preference for many of you, but for me the following things frustrated me a lot. They're not failures though, but rather deliberate design decisions - ones I tend to strongly dislike.

1) The Save System: I absolutely abhor it when devs take away player control, and that's what they've chosen to do in this game. The game uses a checkpoint system, that keeps updating as you clear out areas - your game will only ever have one save i.e. your last checkpoint. I'm perfectly fine with this actually. What I'm not fine with is how we have no control over when those checkpoints occur, nor even any indication of where in the levels they are. The notifications just pop up every so often in the corner of your screen. I'm not asking for the ability to save wherever we want (such as in the middle of a firefight), but an interactable object that we can choose to activate would've been a much better choice. You can make it such that it can only be activated after clearing whatever gauntlets are meant to be handled in that area, which would serve to still prevent save-scumming. Why is this an issue? Cos there's frequently stuff you want to do before moving on after each set piece, and having the checkpoint trigger automatically means you have to do all of that again every time you have to reload. And then there's times when you've done something challenging (but that's not fun), following which you then desperately hope for another checkpoint somewhere just so you don't have to do it again. Like what, you ask? Well...

2) The Platforming: Was Doom ever known as a platformer? Well apparently now it is one. I don't know what made the devs think the FPS crowd was hungry for platform challenges, but here we are. It's not even a particularly good platformer (there are far better titles for that - try Ghostrunner for instance). It's just there, shoehorned into a franchise that never needed it. Thankfully it's not constant, but it is liberally present. The platforming sections are a pain to get through, and what's worse is that many of them don't feature a checkpoint at the end (like all the major combat set pieces do). So if you do die soon after, you'll be forced to go through the whole chore again.

3) The Level Design: This is something that does carry over from the classic Doom games - some levels being confusing mazes, requiring liberal consultation of the map (which is thankfully better than in the classic games). This is, mind you, a linear game, not open world. But while the set piece combat encounters can be intense, there can also be significant downtime between them while you get your bearings. Also, some levels have also borrowed a page from Doom 3 - permanently locking off earlier parts of the level. I'm not talking about locking the door for a fight mind, but just preventing you from going back for good. Not for any sensible narrative reason either, just shutting it off with a door no longer responding or a ledge you have to drop from being too high to jump back up to. I hated that aspect of Doom 3, and I hate it here too (though thankfully it's less common here than in 3). Yes yes, I know this game is all about push forward action, but let that be left to players' discretion, yeah? Btw, for some reason health packs - that you've already picked up! - respawn when you reload a checkpoint, though armor and ammo doesn't. Not sure why, but I don't like it. This is on Ultra-Violence.

4) The Difficulty Curve: The game is indeed tough on the higher difficulties. However, here we have yet another game that falls into the trap of seemingly getting easier as you get further into it. Between weapon mods, suit upgrades and rune unlocks, the new enemies you face simply can't keep up. It's not about the difficulty levels either - raising that will still have its biggest impact early in the game, tapering off later. I suppose this isn't as much of a problem if you're the type to set yourself personal challenges (hardcore, speedruns, 1 gun runs, etc.), but for the regular player it feels kinda off.

[u][b]Overall:-[/b][/u] Well there you have it. Is it a good game? Yes, but it also requires you to put up with certain infuriating decisions. If you're the type who's okay with all of that, then great. The game will work for you. For me, it was an experience composed of awesome intense set piece battles, followed by oft-infuriating stuff outside of that. There's also an Arcade mode available, so maybe the game is just best played that way. Anyway, I hope all this exposition helped someone."
Not as good as the original game.
"No quick save, too much button mashing mastery required for double jumps, and all of the cheat codes have been disabled except for God mode. It went from a PC classic to another console disappointment."
too scary.
no jungle. pretty bad
"Imagine going through the game and missing one hidden trial because the game unnecessarily blocks you from backtracking in levels by sealing doors on you, so you go have to go back to mission select and restart to complete it and it bugs your game and you lose all your upgrade points and have to keep redoing the same level because it never registers the challenges you finished as completed. Wouldn't that be crazy?"
"Took too much brain capacity to play, BARREL RADIUS IS TOO BIG NERF BARRELS I HATE YOU BETHESDA >:(((((("
my save was corrupted after power outage and I`m not feeling like starting over
Graphics + Music is great but find the gameplay to be a bit bland and boring. Didn't live up to the hype
It's just not that fun. Insanely repetitive and insipid gameplay.
"What a dumb, dumb game.

If tearing demons' limbs with a shotgun blast and then bashing their skulls in an explosion of blood, before cutting a zombie demon in half with a chainsaw sounds appealing to you, I guess the game is addressed to you. It so happened that a game being a gorefest hasn't been a selling point to me since I turned 14.

What speaks volumes is that while I looked online for a solution to an issue I had with the game showing only gamepad prompts and no keyboard/mouse ones, I actually saw people advising others to play the game with a controller instead of the standard FPS mouse + keyboard combo. After only some minutes in the game, you can understand why: it's an FPS where aiming is mostly irrelevant. You are encouraged to charge in with your shotgun and get up close and personal, as made obvious by the glory kill system (a melee finisher on staggered enemies).

Environments sometimes seem to be clear, until all of a sudden waves of demons appear out of nowhere, making the game a glorified version of Left 4 Dead, but with even less subtlety (not that L4D had much of it).

The best thing I can say about Doom is that if I may have harbored an interest for Doom Eternal and might have been tempted to buy it during a sale, at least now I know to stay clear of it thanks to this one."
I cant keep up with this... its just shooting running around press f...press g when out of ammo. I have no room to be creative or developing any better playstyle.. i like the music tho.
"cool, tho basic tier single player FPS's are totally lost on me. plus DOOM ETERNAL exists so this game is kinda pointless."
This game is awful. It's incredibly racist and xenophobic in the way only sweaty white gamergate gamers could enjoy. Please avoid this alt-right drivel
less fun than filing your taxes

"Just all in all an atrocious game that I would never recommend to anyone, after playing the game I have realised that since doom 3, the franchise has spiraled down hill and I will never buy a single game of this franchise. The movement is clunky and slow. Weapons uninspiring and sort of garbage. They make the main character into some super soldier that is supposed to end hell. However whilst playing the game I felt more like a pincushion for the enemies and often times died because I came around a corner and the AI, seeing me through the wall, calculated where I would end up. This would be fine for a game like doom 3 because it was old and the tech and possibilities were not developed or advanced enough at the time. But at 2016 this is not ok. Oh and btw this is definitely not a horror game it is an action shooter and nothing more."
Meh
i dont have doom
Meh
Console-esque eye candy junk with none of the original flavour of the game.
insanely repetitive but still the best doom game
Bad game
Doom Eternal has no Deathmatch or team Deathmatch. Dont even bother paying these bethesda fucks any money until they realize they fucked up. Fucking morons.
Evil vodoo demonic witchcraft stuff. Me no gusta.
Movement is pretty bad. They brought back that gliding around map feel to it. Huge difference in the original versus this... old game is was like one shot kill and this you have to spend a little effort with the kills making the movement horrible.
"I've beat this game twice, once on console and once on PC and I still don't get the hype of this game. I want to like it I do but I just cant I get SO bored after like half an hour it just feels repetitive almost all the time. I want to, but I cant say I enjoyed this game."
dogshit ähxde
Loved the game; my save got corrupted.
"Was kinda meh for me, a good game but fuck glory kills. Also once you get past level 4 or some shit level design devolves into arena -> corridor. I did like it somewhat but it wasn't worth the price. Game was way overhyped imo."
"Sorry, while I like the game I can;t get behind any game that does not allow you to save when exiting. I have other things in my life going on that to try and figure out when is a good time to end playing a game because I may have to redo too much is just stupid. Sorry those that want the challenge of no save should have an option to select that. Too bad as I like the game, but a royal pain without any save option"
No sound. No help. No refund.
"I went into this game with big expectations. It started strong, but quickly went down. I was forcing myself to just finish it, but I couldn't. Not because it was hard, but because I was extremely bored and unmotivated.

Cons:
- Extremely repetitive
- Linear
- Predictable
- Bad story

Pros:
- Gorgeous graphics (even in 2020)

Level recap: 20% demon shooting in designated area, 80% platforming for keys/collectibles. 
Melee system is really silly - you need 12 rockets to make demon just kneel, but you can punch through his chest and rip it's heart off. Why bother shooting? Just kung-fu through...

Upgrade system for weapons is good idea, but it is very simple. A little more depth to it would make the game better.

Voice acting is terrible. I mean a tiny bit above windows narrator level.

If you like straight jump'n'shoot with nothing else, then this is for you. If you like games with good story, depth and rich gameplay - I do not recommend this game to you."
dont like
My eyes are failing me and making me dizzy
"Doom eternals better. Only play this to get the story, then just go to doom eternal"
"The game has very bad checkpoint system, feels like I'm playing a game straight from 1990's where autosave functionality was not invented."
"I don't really think this game is for me at the end of the day but I still think the concept is cool.

I recommend you try it out and see for yourself!"
"DOOM 2016 is frustrating, not because it is difficult or because it is a bad game, but because its overall design often loses track of what the game is very clearly trying to be.

Let's get this out of the way; the soundtrack is fantastic and the core gameplay of shooting demons is really fun and mostly well-built, yadda yadda yadda. Everyone's been telling you this because it's true, the game is a lot of fun when it's focusing on this. The issue is the game doesn't seem to want to focus on its strengths due to some misguided nostalgia-baiting mixed with some strangely shoehorned-in mechanics from more modern design trends. This review will not focus on the good, because every other one does and because ultimately? The game doesn't want to focus on it either, so why should this review do so?

DOOM 2016's pacing is terrible, and doesn't get into a nice rhythm until the last 3 levels of the game (which is a real shame, because those last three levels are really good). In an effort to channel DOOM 1 and 2's former glory, the game aims for a 50/50 split between combat and exploration, with big labyrinthine maps. While this worked very well in previous games because the games were built for it, with slower-paced combat, interesting and varied environments and, let's face it, technical limitations which made scouring the map for keys one of the only ways to extend playtime and offering variety, DOOM 2016's exploration is completely at odds with its combat system. Combat is lightning fast and adrenaline-pumping, while exploration is, frankly, a boring slog with horrendous platforming sections in them. This could be fine if the environments were actually interesting, which they are not, with the same color palette across all levels but the last three and generally uninspired visual presentation. It could have been fun if the movement had been designed to make traversing the environment fun, like with grappling hooks (I really hope Eternal fixes this, I haven't played it yet as of writing this) or really anything to make exploration anything else from just walking a barren landscape, and while DOOM 2016's movement works really well for combat, it definitely isn't enjoyable on its own. Finally, exploration could have been interesting if the map design was geared for it and provided interesting paths, but it feels like the maps were designed more as big labyrinths with some rewards sprinkled here and there rather than an actual level with a consideration for the way the player would traverse it. 
This utterly killed the game for me. The early stages have those huge maps with boring exploration, and the combat sequences which are really good are very short, which makes going back to the exploration even more painful. It feels like the game reluctantly goes ""ugh, fine, here are some enemies to fight. But don't take too long, you have more uninteresting terrain to sift through!!"", merely accessing your demand for fun rather than offering it. 

And, as if to further drag the fun down, to exploration is associated a... progression system. Completely superfluous and ultimately more damaging than anything, DOOM 2016 has your character receive incremental gains to your health, armor and ammo pick-ups as well as some other features throughout the game. These upgrades do not change gameplay, as all they do is ""make x attack more powerful, give x more damage"", and in some cases actually make gameplay worse; one upgrade option is to receive more ammo from pickups. Should you upgrade this, running out of ammo is no longer a concern, so you won't be switching weapons as much (maybe this changes in higher difficulties, I played through the game on Ultra-Violence, but really if you need a system to balance out 2 difficulty modes out of 5 but harms the other 3... maybe you should rethink some things). This doesn't exactly force you down exploration, I was able to go on perfectly fine by avoiding the parts which I found unenjoyable, but it certainly kills pacing when you have to regularly go in a menu to pick an option to make your armor cap go up. 
Some upgrades, called Runes, actually do impact gameplay a little bit and are somewhat interesting, especially since they are acquired through challenge missions you have to do. However, those are hidden throughout the map. That same boring map. They aren't too hard to find, but again, the player needs to slog through exploration to get to the good part.
Similarly, the weapon attachments, essentially secondary fire, are very interesting and are most of the time situated on the main path. However, each weapon has two options of secondary fire, which as a result makes some of them very superfluous. Why have one of your attachments make you immobile, in a game where being immobile is the best way to get you killed? They could have been great as a super-situational thing to do, but you need to actively switch your secondary module in battle, which takes wayyyy too much time even with the upgrade that makes it faster, which means switching weapon then module ultimately isn't worth the risk taken by not shooting for so long.

Both of these things take away a lot from the actual fun of the combat. The last three levels demonstrate how great this game can be, as those issues are stripped away; no more exploration, by that time you have unlocked mostly everything and have settled in a set of modules which you never change, and combat encounters last much longer. But, and this is a theme throughout the game, to get there you need to slog through unnecessary, boring bullshit where encounters are very short and you need to explore the boring map and complete annoying platforming puzzles to progress. 

While the fun parts are fun, DOOM 2016 is frustratingly unfocused, and I ultimately cannot recommend it, especially with Eternal out there and, hopefully, stripped away of these issues. I might give Eternal a try and update this review later on, but until then... 
Oh, and the audio is pretty unstable in 2020. Dialogue sometimes lowers to an inaudible volume and some SFX are repeated and layered to a very loud volume. I also had a couple glitches here and there. Aaaand the loading times are atrociously long."
"it's almost good but i cant overlook that this racist game is deeply rooted in colonialism and other problematic things like that, it's like duke nukem but for the alt-right and bad guys"
"Headache of a map system and trivially easy gameplay. You just move forward, kill things, check the map. That's all. Doesn't stand up vs a game like borderlands, where the gameplay feels very directed and objectives aren't a headache to track. I get that it's doom, but games are and were capable of more when this was released. Flashy and gory, but sort of a shallow experience I do not wish to continue. The best part was the music."
"Complex and secret filled levels, hell demons, massive guns, phenomenal music. A true PC FPS masterpiece. Why would you play some other lame, console port with unskippable cutscenes, checkpoint saves, despawning corpses, awkward first person platforming and canned kill animations? Except DOOM 2016 has all of these modern blights and somehow still gets a pass. IMO, the positives I mentioned (which really are very positive) make these issues feel even worse. The checkpoint system makes exploring the levels, with their atrocious map system, an absolute chore. Miss a jump, get stuck in the geometry, or die in combat? You might get sent back to the beginning of a combat encounter from 10 minutes ago and have to do all of it again. Some of the secrets are difficult to pick out from normal level geometry and being unable to quicksave really dissuades you from wanting to 'experiment' with a potential tricky jump.

Speaking of platforming: it's not particularly hard, but you're always at the mercy of the automatic ledge grabbing. Sometimes (albeit rarely) it eats a jump input or won't register a ledge. If this causes you to have to restart from a checkpoint that was 2 combat encounters ago, you might be more than a little annoyed. Anything not tagged as a ledge will just cause you to slide off or will glitch you out of the map (this game has very fragile geometry, check out a speed run), so platforming is a matter of finding the pre-set paths, rather than figuring out your own route. 

Every time I'm forced to sit through another stupid cutscene, I wish I had a keybind to punch the screen and ignore what was happening, like in the first level. (Great joke the first time you see it, but makes you wish they'd just stuck with talking heads for the story). There's generally 1-2 at the beginning and/or end of every single level and none of them are in any way necessary. 

Those are the major negatives, really. The despawning corpses (even on a powerful PC at nightmare settings) is just kind of a lame concession to performance when the game already runs incredibly well on modest hardware. With all the backtracking required, it would be cool to see the carnage from prior fights. The fights themselves are more repetitive and random than the original Doom and the pacing is either 0 during exploration or dialed up to 11 for every combat encounter. A lot of people seem to like it, I've just kinda gotten tired of it around halfway through. Yeah, it looks and sounds excellent, especially with the epic soundtrack, but the combat is simplistic and not particularly challenging even on Nightmare difficulty if you're an experienced FPS player. Enemies are weaker to certain weapons and alt fire modes, but you can make it through any combat encounter without paying attention to that at all if you just aim your shots. There are a decent number of other FPS games out there with a higher skill ceiling and equally satisfying combat if you're into that sort of thing. 

Look, I don't expect most people to find much value in this review. Most people have already played this game and are totally thrilled with it, and that's great. However, if you somehow haven't tried it yet and any of the issues I've mentioned seem particularly tedious and frustrating, maybe just play something else."
This game feels like it's turned down to 9.
scary
"The game is boring and repetitive. I don't understand why the rating is so high to such not interesting game. No plot at all. Maybe for first Doom in 1993 it was okay because game dev. was limited , but for now days it's not playable at all."
"people are afraid to call this game bad because it's a doom game by id software and takes the rip and tear doomguy meme in stride. the game makes a really good first impression but that falls really quick and you immediately see that it leans on crutches to make up for issues with the game's core gameplay loop and general pacing. the game holds a carrot over your head and jiggles it constantly in a desperate bid to facilitate player engagement. the doomguy getting frustrated at the lack of shooty shooty in cutscenes as the game slowly and methodically trods you through a bunch of empty cooridors with boring exposition setpieces and fallout-tier voiceovers does not make me go ""haha this is sooo ironic"" it makes me go ""you could have cut all of this out, cut out this entire level, and the game would have been better off""

the game isn't about shooting things, its about using a call of duty quick melee attack. its about collecting items to unlock suit and weapon upgrades to help you collect more items. everything you want from this game is an illusory experience presented to you through overcomplicated proxy systems. the challenge of the hardest difficulty is in where the game decides to teleport you after the quick melee kills - you can literally see the imps in the background waiting for your animation to finish before winding up another fireball. the core gameplay loop is disorienting, it doesn't give you a challenge, it just makes you feel like you're rolling dice and overwhelms you with meta-choices to give you the illusion of depth. there are obvious dopamine pellet dispensers built into every facet of this game's design and im surprised the demons don't make slot machine noises and spit glowing gold coins out of their mouths when they die. oh wait

i didn't play this game for very long and i never want to play it ever again. this isn't mild displeasure, its straight up disgust"
boring as hell
"Doomguy runs slow as hell now, every difficulty up to ultraviolence is pissbaby easy. Nightmare is only ""hard"" because you're incredibly slow and fat, so there are some fast projectiles you can't dodge without a lot of space to get momentum going, and the damage on almost everything is cranked up to be a 2 hit kill from full health. Imps just spend most of their time running around like chickens with their heads cut off, and every enemy has such a comically long wind up animation you'd have to be sedated to actually be surprised by their attack if they're anywhere in your field of view. This is mostly just boring tech demo shit, most of the player's time is spent waiting for glory kill animations, being visually assaulted by gigantic tutorial popups and unskippable weapon pickup animations that block off even more of the screen not already occupied by the giant hud* and giant viewmodels. I could have gone through the first quarter of DooM 2 just in the time spent stuck waiting for cutscenes about the story I couldn't give half of a rat's ass about. 

If you actually want this sort of garbage you're far better off just playing brutal doom, at least that's garbage that doesn't make you wait for the mediocre combat, or try to shove some garbage syfy channel b-movie ""story"" down your throat every 2 seconds.

*It is possible to disable the more offensively huge elements of the hud, however you're still stuck with every weapon viewmodel taking up about a third of the screen at all times."
"Difficulty played: Ultra-Violence.
Status: Abandoned (got approximately to the point where I get the BFG).

Not very DOOM. Awkward movement system that works, but is flawed in design due to its indecision with whether it wants to be fluid or tanky. Incredibly uninspired level design. Story that is lackluster and is not daring enough in regards to exploring the topics it sets to explore. As that one rare fan of original DOOM with a dislike for this game, I feel unimpressed by this game and personally struggle to recommend it to anyone.

If you really like boomer shooters, Dusk, Wrath, Amid Evil are better at being boomer shooters for sure. And I definitely did play better gory and snappy games than this, but don't think that I can give directions in that regard."
"Every time I open the game, it usually gets to the title and then freezes my entire PC. The only way to stop it is by restarting my PC. It's literally unplayable."
full of bugs defenatly not recomended although the story is good i couldn't finish it
The game suddenly has got too big for my hard drive with all the updates FFS
any reason for the game always crash?
I hate checkpoints.
i know what it feels like to be a child again.... (i had a very poor upbringing and it brings me lots of negative thoughts)
"This game was probably great when it came out, it has fun gameplay, a decent storyline, but now it seems to only want to run like garbage. Constantly throughout playing the game, it would tell me I ran out of space, but the amount I needed was ""0kg"", and it would tell me that exact thing every 5 minutes. Then if I died, the game would jump to the main menu when I wanted to restart from a checkpoint, and then finally, when I dealt with all that to get to the final boss, I died, the game threw me back to the main menu, and my save file got corrupted. I just wanted to play this so I could then play doom eternal, but this game doesn't want me to play it."
"Better than its sequel ""DOOM Eternal"" but still has many flaws and outdated game design such as colored key cards. The demons in this game look way more menacing and scarier than the ones in Doom Eternal's which look so dumb and cartoon like! The single player campaign is amazing with so many weapons and demon enemy types to eviscerate! The multiplayer is underrated and not as bad as reviewers and people say it is. This game is pretty damn good though with excellent sound design, graphics, level design, and gun play! Although I wish the guns sounded louder and the gore and blood was increased. The plasma pistol sucks balls though and at least in the sequel you start off with a shotgun! Doom 3 was a more unique shooter! Still this game is amazingly fun and looks amazing and it's way more polished than Brutal Doom which has lost it's novelty and feels like a 12 year old edgy wet dream! This game does feel more and generic in my honest opinion."
"My biggest gripe with the new DOOM:

Finishing moves. Is this Mortal Kombat? No, that doesn't belong here. And... how come when I do these moves I lose more health than I gain? What is the point of this?

They did this in the newer Doom too. So it's dead to me. I don't understand this mechanic. Is this what kids want these days?

Also after giving it another go, I realized you can get carried away killing enemies and then miss some secret and can't go back to the previous room. Getting all the secrets requires some very methodical approach which is odd for a shooter.

Weapon upgrades aren't bad but they're not that great."
"Spent months playing this (with a cheat code) and have NEVER played ANY multiplayer game.  Would spend hours just wandering around looking for hidden spots and shortcuts using a cheat to make it easier to wander around.  BUT NO MORE, use of ANY cheat makes the save game corrupt, totally uncalled for and puts a nail in the coffin, this franchise is dead, now to get my money back as they have bricked the game to me and it not how i purchased it, bait and switch. They might have done it thinking I would go buy the new one (almost did) but, nope, not gonna ever happen."
very repetitive and boring. I truly struggled and forced myself to finish this game. no interesting story or narrative to save it either.
"i played this a game a while ago and it was pretty fun. i recently had an urge to replay it and found something really disturbing. if you look carefully, there is a lot of satanic imagery that i didnt even know was there! please do not let your kids play this game,  it is tainted by the devil! god bless, and my prayers are with you."
"Mick deserved none of this; boycott Bethesda, id Software, ZeniMax, and Microsoft.
https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce"
"Don't buy this crap. This game is shit. I killed everything! It was amazing! Lots of fun. But I can't progress until I find that red keycard. So I pull up the map. Oh, sweet lord... Let's obscure EVERYTHING by piling layers upon layers of floors on top of each other. The map looks great; it would rock as 3D screensaver, BUT IT'S SHIT AS  A FUNCTIONING MAP!!! These levels are HUGE! They're vertically layered. It's a great amount of fun, but when you've killed everything and you're wandering these empty mazes trying to find a keycard you missed it becomes soooooo boring and soooooo frustrating."
I miss classic doom music
"Level design could be better, tons of ""where do i go"" nonsense. Honestly at this point just get Doom eternal. The weapon handling feels so much better in Doom Eternal than here."
"The first two thirds of the game were pretty dull. One minute you were slaying demons having an alright but somewhat repetitive time, then you were systematically searching every inch of the level for a keycard that you missed somewhere for what feels like an eternity, that happened a few times. Where am I meant to go? Where is it? Then eventually you find it tucked away on a corpse in some obscure corner that you didn't notice because of the sheer number of corpses you see on your travels.
The game did get a fair bit better towards the end, but still not great. It also crashed a few times near the end."
"While Doom 2016 is a very good recreation of the original Doom game it feels lacking in mechanical depth and map variety to match up with other games in the same genre. Overall the has a solid gameplay loop, but it is missing some moment options to really get into an endless flow for me. Doom eternal has moment mechanics and level design variety that feels like it should have been in Doom 2016.

 If you have not played any of the new doom games I recommend getting just Doom Eternal as it feels more like what the original vision for Doom 2016 should have been."
i played  for around 9 hours of the game then the graphics took a shit and died on me plz fix
"The map drives me crazy.  Finding the way forward is a mystery  No guide points.  It's a jumping puzzle,???"
i don't know how they took the concept of killing demons in hell and made it just kinda boring and repetitive but they sure did
"If Steam had a neutral option, it would be for this Game. Given the generous Checkpoint system, the times that I've clipped though floors, walls, ""simply jumped out of bounds into a trapped area"", and been yeeted off the map from hitting a surface the wrong way, I'll look past it.

I heard a lot about the game's music and mechanics, but playing it didn't live up to the hype. Glory kills and the chainsaw sound like an interesting mechanic, but it doesn't feel satisfying. It's like Bethesda just giving us a pat on the back and saying, ""Oh You're SO COOL THE DOOM SLAYER, And SOOOO Sassy with you're angsty attitude. Press button for GLORY KILL....and another.....and another.........."" 

The weapon choice seemed a bit bleak, though the mods were somewhat interesting. I don't know if I was expecting something like the old school quake/doom high octane arenas, but it felt more like a prius running on regular. I've have felt more high-octance from a BL2 fight than here.

Anyone else notice the Hell Razer enemy looks so weird, like you can notice the live action animation capture in the way it fumbles around?

Sure I was distracted half the time trying to find random secrets which slowed the game, but since it's tied to the full upgrading experience, don't you have to?"
"The combat is very good, but the maps are abismal, hate them with with the fires of hell!"
"The movement is too slow, the weapon handling and upgrades are kinda lame, the story is dull. Arena fights are fun from time to time but pretty repetitive. So the campaign is lame. The arcade mode on the other hand is quite fun.

Pros
[list]
[*] Graphics are decent
[*] Arena mode is fun
[*] It's Doom
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] optimization has a potential for improvements. It took me quite a while to find settings that look decent and maintain 80-90 fps at 1440p. Those fps are extremely low considering the graphics quality and the size of each section.
[*] Movement speed is kinda slow
[*] Some of the weapons or too situational and just seem to be useless even when upgraded till the max. I ended up using only three guns and switched to the fourth when I didn't have anything else left or when I didn't wanna use the chainsaw yet to refill my ammo.
[*] Multiple guns share the same type of ammo so you are never going to touch half of your guns. I'd prefer a different type of ammo for each gun so I'd be forced to use them even though some of them just need a buff.
[*] I don't like the mechanic of the chainsaw refilling so much of your ammo. Its just going from ""I don't have any ammo at all"" to ""Wow, I can't pick up any further ammo""
[*] I didn't play it on a high difficulty level since some of the deaths in the beginning were simply frustrating. The overall combat doesn't seem to be balanced at all. It changes from 10 minutes with a low amount of enemies and boring fights to a lot of enemies within the blink of an eye. Sometimes this leads to intense fights but I'd prefer these intense fights all the time with better guns since the TTK against heavy enemies is pretty long.
[/list]

This game has potential and with just a few minor tweaks could be insanely good and a hell of a banger:
[list]
[*] faster movemend speed
[*] more enemies
[*] less downtime
[*] better weapons and/or shorter ttk
[*] rebalancing of weapons
[*] different ammo types for each gun
[/list]

When you completed a game it's never a good sign when you are glad it is finally over."
"canny boring and repetitive once you get past the first hour the game is just boring, no real story no purpose just shoot or bash ""F"" 
i do get the appeal its just not for me"
unironically bored me to death on Ultra Nightmare
Cringe
"hjuujgmklh









































no"
"For 6 bucks the game is worth it for sure I'd say. 
As usual however Id Software show how aside from gunplay they are entirely incompetent at everything else but yet this time there are incompetent at the gunplay in this by forcing you to gunplay less. Watching this I never could realize how the disturbingly stup*d as f*ck melee totally ruins the game to such a amazing degree. Makes playing this without ever using melee no matter what under any circumstances impossible so you have to bring fists to, every, GUNfight. Harder difficulty past normal is not doable or more like utterly completely needlessly totally impossible since you won't have the ammo and health.
Soundtrack is pretty much for fact worst soundtrack of the decade and even saying the word soundtrack is being generous. It's literally just annoying noise. 

All negatives aside at least this game is still better then playing a sick fucked in the head terrorist

This game is now my new low bar for trash gunplay the previous holder being Shadow Warrior 2 where at least the pea shooters and airsoft guns gave you enough ammo to kill enemies and killed way waaaay damn faster. Game does Doom such a disservice it's mind boggling why the studio hates Doom so much... but easy to figure out why just need to look at the stupid masses"
"Not a game for me I guess...

I couldn't follow the Map and spent most of time wandering around lost. In the end I uninstalled where I had to climb some tower and kill some lady and basically I got fed up trying to find my way around and the endless mind numbing Demon fights became a boring slog fest. 
Graphics are good and its a visually stunning Game. If you like killing Hordes of Demons then this is for you. 

I'll stick to killing NAZI's :)"
"I really wanted this game to be fun. I gave it several chances. But I really don't want to have to use a walkthrough for every level. The action is awesome and I want more of that, but every level is turning into an experience where I have to explore every nook and cranny to figure out the next step or find the next keycard. Sure there are waypoints, but they lead behind locked doors. Sure there is a minimap but I explore every available greyed out area with no luck. It's just not fun."
fro
It's just running around shooting things. The space is like a maze so you can be looking for a way to move forward for quite some time just to go further. I was expecting more because of the reviews but it is actually quite basic.
"this might anger some people, but honestly, just play Eternal. It's better in literally every conceivable way. This game is fun at first but REALLY starts to drag on in the later missions. It's a slower, more tedious, less varied version of Doom Eternal. You can just skip it really.

Amazing soundtrack though"
"Not what i expected, gameplay made me dizzy. Maybe allow a demo of it first, if there is one, and i missed it. im sorry."
"It was fun while it lasted, but had to jump through loops just to get the game to save, had to figure out how to create a new save location in the game files.....when that was over, progressed through the campaign, game crashed, save corrupted....i just didn't feel like messing around with it anymore, so i uninstalled until i feel like restarting the game."
shit game
"Fun but quickly repetitive and mind numbing, game for a 12 year old who just wants to shoot stuff with no challenge."
"played it on family share, have no idea how I'm allowed to review it, lets give it a thumbs down so people wonder what my problem was with the game but all I want to know is how I can review the game that I've never had, steam is wacky"
kids did not enjoy
"Couldn't get into DOOM, bought it because the hype and reviews but was disappointed by the game play."
"Very pretty and technically superbly optimized but it's just not DOOM. You move from one arena combat to another one. Getting locked up  in a closed space with the monsters who spawn out of the thin air all around You is just a very boring approach to making the game more challenging. The scarcity of ammo and the generally ineffective weapons just add to the undoomlike feel of this game. No one-shot kills here. When You shoot a thing in the head with a shotgun You expect it to die, be it from Mars or Venus. that's the difference in using a shotgun over a pistol, right?"
Not my type of game fun first 30min after that everything is the same since its just mindless killing.
"Do I recommend it? Unfortunately not. 
Don't get me wrong it's a technological marvel, as ID soft games nearly always are and i've been playing them since my early teens when the original Doom took the world by storm.

But this? It seems to be confused about its identity. 

On the one hand it's being one of the most heart racing, awe inspiring gore drenched FPS in existence. And for this I love it.But on the other hand it's trying to be some kind of (action) RPG with bucket loads of text to read and upgrades to get. And to me the two just don't go very well hand in hand. If I wanted an action RPG i'd play Fallout.

The fact I have to keep stopping the demon slaughter to go read long rambling articles of text to fully be in tune with the story just totally kills it. Yes I could just skip all that but then I get that nagging feeling i'm missing out. I wish they could have narrated and acted the story and information better in game. 

Also what's extremely frustrating is that individual logs / articles are broken into multiple parts. Who thought that was a good idea?! It's just collections for collecting  sake. 

Doom 3 (my favorite of the series) did this far better in my opinion with audio logs you could listen to and play at the same time together with well dispersed cutscenes that didn't feel like they were taking away the action for too long. 
Shame: 4/10"
"Being an original Doom fan from back in the day, still are to some extent, this just doesn't cut it for me. Maybe, if you are 12 years old, this would be real fun. Stunning visuals, great map design, don't get me wrong. Sadly I just got bored with it and uninstalled when I reached the Hell chapters. 

SnapMap is terrible. I mean, really bad. A four-digit combination lock has way more possibilities than what you can rustle up with this. All content will look and feel the same, because it relies on pre-existing set pieces that can only be connected in certain ways, with no room for deviation. It's a shame developers have turned their backs on modding communities by introducing in-game pseudo-level editors that limit creativity - a Steam Workshop page would have been a game-changer.

And now there's this new Doom Eternal out... which is set in Hell.... and can also stay in hell, till hell freezes over, because I shall not be buying it anytime soon."
"What kind of bs is this? I no longer own the game?? My library just has the ""Purchase"" option and when i try to click ""Play now"" on the store page, it just redirects me to the same store page...."
As of today Augest 4th this game just stopped letting me play was about to hop on when it said i had to buy it again WTF Id and Bethesda FIX IT SO I CAN RIP AND TEAR
A game that no longer works asks me to buy it again why .
"我头回遇到这种傻逼事情，我玩了7个小时，睡前保存退出，第二天运行游戏变成了一个大大的“购买”！！卸载后库里也没有了。我CNMD我买了个试玩版吗？发行商还带回收功能的？谁能给我个解释？！
what the fuck! I have played the game over than 7 hours then can not to run the game, the ""run game"" button changed to ""buy the game"" what is the fucking problem?!"
"its a great game when it works, it keeps corrupting my save, boots me back to the title screen every time a checkpoint has to be loaded, it just freezes at random and I have to shut off my pc to close the game again. idk if im the only one with these kinds of issues."
"what a fucking joke! i download this piece of shit for 8 hours, install it, play 3 minutes, quit. come back 5 hours later and now the game won't launch.  and fucking steam won't even support it and refers me to the Bethesda website.  what kinda bullshit is this????"
dosnt work anymore dont buy
"Do I recommend this game? Yes. 
Do I recommend you buy this game? Yes.
Why do I not recommend this game in my review? DRM, see the spoiler at the bottom for what spawned this review from me.
[b]Is the issue resolved? Yes*[/b]

[b]Guns[/b]
Shotgun: you can shoot grenades, or burst-shots like a battlerifle
Pistol: ...
Heavy Assault Rifle: har har har. Sniper rifle mode, and rocket-volley mode.
Plasma Rifle: Basically a submachine gun with a shotgun or stun grenade underbarrel attachment.
Minigun: Flaming bullets, or double barrels, take your pick.
Rocket Launcher: you can shoot rockets that explode before they explode, but then still explode, or you can shoot 3 rockets at once.
BFG: almost as cool as the next gun on the list
Super Shotgun: This is a godmode item you unlock halfway through the game, with full upgrades this thing is just a delete-button for demons.

[b]Gun and Character Upgrades[/b]
The game rewards you for exploring levels to find secrets. Every secret you find gives you either Suit upgrade points, or weapon upgrade points. Spend these to max out your gear, ammo, armor, health, or weapon attachments.

Got all the attachments for a weapon? complete an optional challenge to unlock a Mastery upgrade.

[b]Badassery[/b]
Do you want to explode a demon with buckshot? Rockets? Bullet hell? Plasma? Your own bloodied fists? This game is for you.

[b]Level Design[/b]
The levels get kinda samey-same, but I still think they are [i]all[/i] beautifully designed, beautifully detailed, and sell the feel of the game. It's a very grungey Doom, compared to Doom Eternal's arcadey, colorful, shoot-a-demon.





[b]What was that about DRM at the start?[/b]
I do recommend you buy this game, this is a fun game and I think no one should miss out on a good shooter experience.

However, as outlined below, Steam made a booboo. The DRM had disabled a lot of my games, mostly Bethesda games. Apparently it also affected other games. This is the price we pay, this is what we agree to when we buy DRM protected games.

DRM is a protection/security method by which publishers protect their game from piracy. Often this requires an Online-Only state, even for ""Single-Player Only"" titles. 
Often this is a secondary background process that can lock out 5, 10, 20, 40% of your CPU resources, or maybe even GPU resources. 
DRM often has a direct effect on your game/computer performance during the game, lower FPS, input lag, and hardware depending it can cause stutters.
This is the accepted risk.

My advice stands. If there are legal DRM-Free options for a game, I highly recommend you seek them out. Humble Bundle, GoG, they usually do good work here.


[spoiler]Game is marked as pirated or something now, won't launch. Redirects to store page. Purchased legitimately through steam. Not the only game this happened to, seems only Bethesda titles so far. Doom 2016, Doom Eternal, Dishonored 2... Do not buy, it seems the keys might be illegitimate, or maybe it's just a glitch. I can't be sure. Consider alternative methods, GoG, Humble Bundle, if you're willing to gamble on doxxing yourself you could even consider directly buying from Bethesda.[/spoiler]"
i cant play the game  i pay the fulll price for it and download it but its sending me too the the store page where i can buy it why ????
"No longer working. I try to launch the games (as usual), and it just brings up an info page about the game in the Steam client instead of running the game."
this game is so fucking unpolished it's unbelievable
"TL;DR: Save your money and buy DOOM Eternal instead.

At first glance, DOOM 2016 (or DOOM 4, or the DOOM remake, or whatever you want to call it) seems like a dream come true for lovers of the franchise. With plenty of frenetic demon-slaughtering action.

And then you look past the nostalgic filter and realize, oh wait, this sucks.

The combat gets very same-y after a while with half the weapons being flashy at best but utterly useless past their challenges or introductory levels. I spent most of the game using just the combat shotgun for small demons and the rocket launcher for the big ones. The chainsaw is ludicrously impractical, and glory kills got very boring, very fast, since you only get 'diversity' in them if you actually aim the kill at a certain bodypart on the demon, rather than just letting the animation be randomized - nevermind the fact that there are limited animations for several demons which just feels cheap (looking at you, Mancubus). 

I thought the addition of an actual story and plot was interesting but it left me with more questions than answers - apparently the 'meat' of the plot is in DOOM Eternal instead, go figure. Probably should have saved my $8 and put it towards that one instead. There was plenty implied but not enough explained - why's Earth *got* an energy crisis so bad this cyborg thinks tunneling into Hell is a good idea, for one thing? What kind of stuff was Olivia Pierce offered by the demons if she basically fed her employees into Hell like a meatgrinder? A cure for her condition? Or something more? And *why* is Samuel just apparently okay with most of this? Nevermind *everything* with those templar knight guys.

The maps have good intentions, but they're so very...dull. The same industrial hallways or the same demonic catacombs, spattered in blood and runes, funneling you into arena fights with demon hordes. Exploring them feels pointless outside of completion/collectibility and I got lost on more than one occasion even with the expanded map because there's just so little diversity. The multiplayer had a lot more diversity.

And speaking of. Truth be told I could have just uninstalled, been slightly disappointed, but not been bothered enough to write out a whole review. But the Multiplayer. Is something goddamn else. 

With no matchmaking (enjoy being paired up with 2k+ hour veteran players when you're a level 1 scrub), NO ANTICHEAT, and most everything locked behind a progression system - I could understand the cosmetics being locked, but the various demons, runes, and weapons being locked behind level progression? Nevermind the fact that 99% of all said items are in fact useless - the rocket launcher and plasma gun are the only ones worth carrying, as are the Harvester demon and the Magnet rune. Trying to 'get good' is like running headfirst into a wall and hoping it eventually breaks before your skull does, and about as enjoyable.

The only way I got the achievements was, once I got the ones that actually took skill, I started AFK'ing in matches to leech EXP to unlock the armor piece ones. And you may be indeed be asking, why I would do this when this isn't exactly making things better?

Because there's no report system or votekick or any method to try and control how your matches go. Why bother trying if you know you're not going to be able to affect your outcome, because some top ten player grabbed four more of his top ten buddies for a little pubstomping? Or because some cheater decided to just go around insta-gibbing you for s#its and giggles?

No matchmaking I could understand, game's old, small population or whatever, but I'm honestly still trying to wrap my head around the fact that there's no anticheat whatsoever. Like good lord, how little do you have to care about your gamemode not to put in that at the bare MINIMUM????

There are so, so, SO many things in the Multiplayer that could have been put in the Singleplayer campaign to make it better. Gorgeous and more diverse maps (like Outbreak, Molten, Orbital, and Boneyard), various demons and weapons - hell, you could have AT LEAST made those things available in the Arcade mode, which just feels like the regular campaign but more boring. Who wouldn't want to play a Prowler hunting down other demons? Or dealing with one stalking you through the darkened halls of the UAC? Playing Infernal Run while being chased by a horde of pinkies?

""So you just want better Singleplayer, isn't that what SnapMap is for-"" AND YOU'D BE RIGHT IF SNAPMAP MODE HAD ANY OF THESE FEATURES, TOO! The limitations in that mode make creating any sort of interesting mini-campaign or private multiplayer map absolutely pointless. I've never seen a map editor that's so limited. Only two weapons? Only twelve enemies at a time? The game itself can handle rendering a hell of a lot more than that, why on *earth* did you put in those kinds of limitations?

In short, there's a lot of potential in DOOM 2016 that just completely and utterly falls flat. Whether because Bethesda or idSoftware or whoever didn't care enough, I don't know. 

But I'm thankful I only spent $8 instead of a full $60 like some people.

(You guys should have remade the Heretic/HeXen games instead.)"
"Data-Miner-EULA from take2. Game doesn't launch unless you add firewall rules for communication with take2 servers. 
No Deal, see you on gog."
"Bethesda knocks it out of the park with its hilarious parody of turning a real game into AAA garbage. Complete with armour upgrades, objectives, and I assume at some point there will be crafting: this game truly shows what would happen if someone tried to take a retro shooter and update it into a modern day piece of shit. A new seat at the table of avant-garde games; was it really worth the damage caused to a beloved franchise?"
"Boring.  Run around, shoot.  Bla bla bla.  Mindless and dull.  If I could get my money back I would, as this is the only game in my inventory that I truly regret spending money on.  It is visually awesome, but that sugar high lasts for about ten seconds until the sheer tedium of the truly vacuous play system kicks in.  The writing for what passes for a ""story"" is just as vacuous and stilted.  You can tell even the voice actors phoned it in.  What a piece of garbage."
:/
boring
It's hard to play and masturbate at the same time :(
[h1] TOO SCARY NOT FOR ME [/h1]
"Its an ok game with big maps and lots to find. But I don't like the combat/infiniate ammo from creatures.

The main down for me is that all rooms are so clean after you just killed tons of monsters. There is no proof that you've been there before.

I also dislike that monsters always spawn around you. I know its to save memory, but pff it just sucks. Let monsters be on the map since the start like the classic fps games."
Slow boring and lackluster compared to the Doom 2 modding community.
"Every level in story mode I played was riddled with bugs from not being able to shoot in a fps... to being stuck in the ground or some how being fused into other parts of the enviroment, i cannot look down and walk up anything and the character clips on almost everything on the ground. If it was once in a while I can understand but its every level..."
Somehow ripping aliens apart gets really old quite quickly.
The game would only play SDR on my 1440p 165hz monitor. It would look washed out and high contrast. Wouldnt play on my 4k 60hz monitor at all. Doom Eternal worked flawlessly on both my monitors.
Justice for Mick Gordon
"Honestly, I just can't get the hype. I played this on xbox one a little after launch and thought the same thing, (hence the low hours played). My friend who is very into Doom and its sequel Doom Eternal urged me to give the game a second shot now that I have a very powerful pc and it was majorly on sale and again I still don't see it. The plot is all over the place, environments are bland and repetitive, the gameplay to me, specifically the combat, is repetitive but its boring: most combat games you're focused on the kill, but with doom its all about injuring your enemy just enough where he doesn't die so you can then finish him off with an execution animation which have little variety. That approach seems like it could have been a strategical one but more times than not it comes off as more of a chore. 

Doom in principal is about feeling like a one man killing machine, yet in practice its about exploring, asking yourself ""where do i go?"", a lot of patience, going somewhat soft on your enemies, always watching your constantly low ammo, and a lot of platforming (despite being an fps).

If you want a game w a somewhat similar approach but performed better I'd recommend Wolfenstein instead."
"I am an old DOOM fan. I have to blast this for being overhyped.
The game itself is not bad, as the gameplay is designed to be pretty fast and destructive.

The campaign though is a horrible result of forced bad design.
It starts with maze maps, with very few VERY ill-placed checkpoints. Many times you will face the frustration of spending 20 minutes to run around and pick things up, face arenas, kill some extra demons, doing a rune challenge, die by trying a jump to a ledge that looked like the way to an important secret and having to do EVERYTHING again.
Then you learn from this and go forward ignoring secrets until you get a checkpoint but suddenly the door closes behind you and you can't get back anymore. It says ""Checkpoint...""

Doomguy starts horrible, slow and frail as he gets nuked by a simple imp charging a fireball from behind the corner. He takes too much time to vault over obstacles, he has NO ammo and has to rely on COOLDOWN BASED GRENADES and glory-killing everything to get health back and avoid wasting 2 extra shots on everything. Weapons start horrible and unsatisfying and enemies are unnecessarily bulky and require special glory-kill attention.

Then things start to change by 1/3 of the game, as levels start to get more and more like arenas safely connected by checkpoints that the designers couldn't fuck up. Upgrades make up for the horrible character to deliver the decent design that was intended. Ammo is plentiful and weapons are strong. Glory kills are not necessary anymore. Secrets are shown on the map so you avoid falling on invisible-walled ledges. Things start getting fun.

Then in the lategame things stop making sense, as upgrades push the game beyond the purpose of DOOM. You get INFINITE AMMO ROTATING TURRET CHAINGUN, ABSURD NUKE ROCKETS, ENDLESS 1 HIT-KILL RAILGUN, DOUBLE LIFE and other broken bullshit to face ever harder arenas.
The game at this point is basically trying to be Serious Sam but you have to jump around a lot. It is not DOOM anymore.

So when it tried to be DOOM it failed. When it tried to be Serious Sam it did a decent job.
From the sequel they said you can expect 50% more glory-kills so that's a pass for me.

Also, HOW THE FUCK DID A MODERN GAME FAIL TO DELIVER MANUAL SAVES?? This isn't even a hardware issue, nor a difficulty issue. It's just horrible design that promotes frustration on maze levels."
"Corrupt saves are a constant occurrence. I do not recommend to persons unwilling to tolerate glitchy behaviour.

Gameplay is great, but the game's data management will drop your progress constantly. Scavenger hunt unlocks are fun the first or maybe second time ... but the 10th time because Bethesda is stupid ... nope."
File keeps getting corrupted
multiplayer ttk too high
Doom just wasn’t for me.  Who am I?  Well I’m a guy who likes depth in his shooters. I like having multiple options for taking down foes.  I like being rewarded for cleverness.  Basically I wanted the whole toolbox. Doom is the best made hammer you can get.  I got it based on the extremely high praise it received. But if you are a person who wants more than just a hammer smashing a nail over and over then this won’t be for you either.
"This game is WAY too over-hyped and is in reality not very good. It's impressive technically for it being a 2016 game and, in my opinion, looks better than DOOM Eternal. The story is fucking stupid and just kinda thrown together; it lacks any point or meaning. The story just drags on and on for longer than it should. Everyone praises the hell out of the combat. THE COMBAT IS NOT GOOD. The enemies are bullet sponges that don't react to being shot. The melee is terrible, it doesn't push enemies or stun them, it's useless. The guns are not very well balanced, the pistol is useless, the combat shotgun is worthless after the super shotgun is found and the other guns feel useless. Grenades are just shit. There is little impact when an enemy is shot. If you want a better DOOM experience play brutal doom or something. I'm serious, brutal doom's combat is WAY more fun and punchy. Many of the levels look samey and are a pain in the ass to find out where to go. The DOOM from 1993 had this problem but I don't remember it being this bad. I wouldn't get this game, it has no replay value and is just kinda boring."
"I think this game is great, I think its fun and interesting, but I also find its gameplay loop to be very ungripping, especially next to Doom Eternal. This game did not keep my attention very long and despite me finding it very good, that alone is a cause for worry, dont you think?

I shouldnt ever just lose attention span to a game immediately like I did this one."
Runs like a piece of shit once you get to the hell levels.
Broken game. Crashes continuously 2 minutes in. No support. REFUNDED.
"meh, slow"
"Mixed feelings on this one, I wish Steam offered something more granular than just ""recommend"" & ""not recommend"", but here we are. There are certainly some of the parts of a rather good game here: a lot of the arena fights are exciting, the music is good, on ultra violence the difficulty felt just right. The main problem is that the levels are mostly just really bad. Once you are in an arena fighting demons it generally feels good because those are well designed, but other than that the levels all just feel really slow and awkward to move around in. Some of them straight-up just seem like they came out of a really shitty 3d platformer. Doom 1 & 2 has remained relevant for all this time in no small part because people keep making excellent WADs for it, so in that context it seems insane that THIS is the best they could manage for an actual new Doom. You want to think they get it, but it's just hard to imagine that being the case while playing through The Foundry or something.

The collectibles and upgrade system isn't  great either and largely feels like a distraction from the meat of the game, but those are trivial complains next to the levels. There's clearly an audience since this game ended up being popular, but idk who I would recommend this to. Certainly not fans of Doom or other classic shooters."
"I had more fun just playing modded Doom 1 and 2. The OST is good and there is couple of guns that were fun.
The Super Shotgun sucks and the possessed raped my ears. I just wanted to kill demons but this robo dude just keeps talking about some stupid story. Not for me 6/10"
"Excellent controls, fun weapons, cool monsters. In single-user... pointless hunting and infuriating climbing puzzles with arbitrary level designs that offer little sense of progress, with lots of non-interactive literal junk -- machines, debris, non-operative doors, etc. -- that add nothing to the game except to demand more pointless hunting. Add to that a confusing map system and inane challenges that distract from the completion of missions. Then on top of that, a dead-end boss leaving you stuck with no way to advance or restart from a previous bookmark other than the last autosaved completion point (or begin from scratch). I haven't played Doom or other FPSs in many years, and I'm astounded at how little improvement I see. The original Doom had atmosphere, dread, and clearly understandable missions that made it creepy and fun. Doom (2016) has moments of great fun when clearing a level of monsters, with awesome battle gameplay, but it ultimately progresses to frustration and then boredom."
this game is ass!!!!!
bad gam
"Played for half an hour then exited the game. Came back to play and it all my settings in video settings and keybinds went back to default and dev mode has been activated on my campaign. Found complaints online about dev mode being forced onto people and it corrupts saves, these complaints were made in 2016 so it's not fixed. asking for support from bethesda is fruitless so hopefully some passerby can tell me how to fix it."
.
"Allready played Brutal Doom mod before this came out, got bored quick."
"Game is constantly closing mid game play since the new update
please fix
this game brings me peace"
"I've played this game for a while, but now it won't launch.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  To many glitches"
"Gets repetitive way too fast (you can see battles from a mile away and can predict the enemies youll face in order ).
-Spoiler, once you encounter armored mancubus, they usually appear by the end of battles
Some battles drag for too long and become boring and since you can only save in checkpoints you will have to re do the whole thing if you die.
Most weapons are useless - only useful weapons are normal shotgun, machinegun, plasma gun, rocket launcher and BFG
Most weapon mods are useless, so dont feel bad if you cannot find all the stupid robots
Enemies are not difficult, just annoying especially imps and summoners.
Zombies with shields are a higher threat than Hell Knights for some reason.  
Platforming is awful ( like in any FPS to be fair )
This is the first Doom I have played were the super shotgun is actually WORSE than the normal shotgun.
Enemies can bug and become invulnerable when ""staggered"" only being killed by glory kills or heavy weapons (more noticeable on cacodemons).
Boss battles are gimmicky, easy and boring.(take too long)
Only fight the cyberdemon once and once he is dead never comes back (like in doom 3)
Only fight Mastermind once.
""""New boss"""" is copy pasted 3 times.
Story is bonkers and halts gameplay like in Doom 3 but this time is actually WORSE than Doom 3 because this Doom is fast paced so the sudden stop for story exposition is more noticeable.
Doom """"Slayer"""" is inconsistent in his behavior, sometimes dont listening to explanations (to appear badass) but then waits patiently while the enemy slowly escapes to an elevator or to listen to the exposition 
All in all... not a BAD game per se but I am so glad I got it on discount.
Played in Ultra Violence, beat it but I dont think Ill replay it.
Lost hype for Eternal but will buy it on discount... for like 5 bucks... after playing this It will be easy to wait for sale."
"Now that there is eternal i can finally leave the purgatory of whether to give positive and negative rating and say go to play eternal guys.
that one is just better in all the ways"
"This is a great example of how not to implement a story. You need at least enough story for people to care and want to uncover more... I still have no clue what is going over an hour in, and all I have done is collect colored key after colored key to open a door... Snore fest 2016, that would have been better off as a horde mode in another title as a bonus option."
"It's a decent game, and I enjoyed it at first, but it started to feel repetitive after awhile."
really fun game but it freezes constantly on my powerful pc along with several other issues. Just get it for console where you don't have to deal with any technical bulllshit
How is this so critically acclaimed? It's one of the most boring games I've ever played. Refunded.
"A fun Rip-and-Tear FPS marred by poor level/progression design and a heavy platforming focus.

Combat: Good.  Its fast, mobile, and promotes swapping between multiple weapons to deal with varied threats. 

Story: Acceptable. More than good enough for a combat-focused FPS. 

Graphics: Decent quality, the levels are fine, nothing special and nothing amazing. The demons are the main highlights, along with a few NPC designs. 

Audio: Combat music is fun DOOM music, non-combat music is acceptable. Some guns feel a little weak in the sound and feedback.

Performance: No issues, does not seem to stand out on either end of the optimization scale. 

Bugs: Clipped through the map several times, often when doing a glory kill. Crashed to desktop 2 times when reloading a checkpoint, but the save worked fine after relaunching the game both times.

Movement: Standard wasd movement, nothing special aside from the addition of a doublejump. unfortunately, the doublejump is a little lacking for the level of platforming and mobility needed to reach some parts of certain levels. Its enough, but deaths due to slight missaiming or timing are irritating and frustrating, killing the flow of the game.

Progression: The main problem lies here. Progression is driven by finding secrets and items hidden around the map, usually requiring platforming or backtracking to get them all. However, its hard to tell *when* you can access a specific secret area, as sometimes you need keys or to complete objectives, but many other times completing the objectives will *prevent* backtracking, meaning anything you missed under the assumption it was unlocked later is now unobtainable. 

This promotes trying to jump and platform around at everything that seems even potentially reachable, every time you complete a single objective, lest your next action lock you out from getting the items. Naturally, since a lot of the places (but not all) require unlocking through objective progression, this means many deaths as you fall off the map (either because you messed up, or because the place was actually unreachable) and have to reload. 

The alternative method of trying to clear the map and then go around and looting it worked in the first few levels, but then there was usually events that prevented backtracking, quite often in forms that were hard to anticipate, leaving the player suddenly locked out. While getting everything on the map *is* unneeded and excessive, the quantity of missed upgrades and lore bits is quite significant, more than half in several cases. It snowballs further when mission challenges are tired to finding all of a specific item on a level, denying even more progression. 

Adding in several occasions of clipping through the map, one time skipping most of a level and all the items and objectives inside it, and the experience of the fun, fast-paced combat is heavily dragged down by either slow, boring slogs of trying to check all the places on the map over and over again, or just a sinking feeling as most of the items and loot is skipped and missed. 

On the bright side, it does appear that shrugging, following the story, and just looting whatever is painfully obvious along the way.. is pretty viable. All those upgrades, mods, and general fun/optimization is not needed to complete the game. Just a shame that the times I did achieve 90-100% of the secrets and items in a level, it required me to spend at least 5x more time exploring, jumping, dying, reloading, and being frustrated compared to the actual combat."
"Meh.

It's a mindless gory shooter that is fine when it works. Sadly, like all first person shooters that try to add platforming, that's just bad.

I'm also running into a lot of jank. Not unexpected for a Bethesda game, I suppose. For example I just got stuck in the menu for the second time because the escape key wasn't exiting like it should have done. There's been other times when I haven't jumped when I should have done, been stuck on geometry that has messed up a jump, etc.

Glad I picked this up on sale, and it definitely hasn't done a good job of selling me on the sequel."
doesnt load.. what a jip
"The game as a whole seems like it would be a lot of fun, but the graphics settings don't save when changed. This means if you have struggles with a lower end computer or can't use certain effects like Motion Blur, then you're locked in. And I haven't been able to find a solution fast enough. Refunding before I surpass Steam's 2 weeks was the only option for me sadly."
Stale and boring.
"I was interested in this game because a few friends played it. BUT

SHUT UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  No matter where you are in the beginning, there is CONSTANT demon noise! So you are unable to determine if where they are coming from and IF there are any enemies in the area. I wasn't able to get ""scared or nervous"" because it was constant and out of place.
I hope to have the spare time to try this game again. WIsh I had saved my money for a different game I wanted to try."
"Felt cool at first but becomes tedious fast. However the biggest sin is that halfway through the game you get a rune upgrade (Rich Get Richer) which gives you infinite ammo if your armor is at max (or half if upgraded). I just end up spamming the charged railgun. The enemies most of the time won't be able to touch you, let alone reduce your armor to below that.

Pros:
+ Nostalgic enemy visual design.
+ Weapon visual design and classic mid-screen placement.
+ Exploration and secrets.

Cons:
- ""Rich Get Richer"" rune, see above.
- Gameplay loop is boring and repetitive: Enter arena, gates close, monsters spawn, sometimes there is a power-up, monsters die, gates open, repeat.
- Weapons feel weak, damage feedback on monsters is too subtle, it's like you're punching at water. Some have weak points, but after finishing the game, still can't tell what they are.
- Damage feedback on self is almost non-existent, to the point where I never know when I'm hit or what my health level is. Original Doom had the bloodied up face and pain sounds.
- Sound design is terrible: Possessed zombie growls overlap and are very loud, as if they are right in your ear. The non-combat music is too quiet and repetitive, and makes you realize just how lifeless the world is.
- Environments are unremarkable: It's either techno facility or hellish ruins. They are not interactive, no physics, object are basically bolted to the ground. Arenas looks like they are designed for multiplayer DM.
- Boss battles are designed pretty badly, except for maybe a short section against the Cyberdemon. It's always a small round arena.
- NPC characters are bland. Just like Doomguy, you won't really care about them. Having their ""monologues"" (Doomguy doesn't talk himself) inserted into story beats just slows the pace down.

It is by no means a bad game, just a dull one. Was excited for Doom Eternal, but this slog only convinced me to remove it from my wishlist. I would rather play Unreal 2."
"I like this game but it isnt the old school Doom. This is a jump puzzle from hell, with some demons thrown in. I was killed more times missing jumps than by the silly demons. The story is cool, I beat the game and now uninstalled. It isnt worth another trip threw hell.The jumping bs is mind numbing. Get it if its on sale for a good story, then forget it"
Game run poorly or lags. no success loading saved campaigns and glitches all over the map. Tried redownloading it and same exact issues. I don't know what happened over the weekend but this game is in serious need of repairs. wouldn't recommend this game to anyone.
I love the Doom series. I enjoyed the gameplay. Alot of the errors and bugs for me sadly. That made me uninstall. Error after error.. please fix before releasing a new game.
"It is really sad the multiplayer is dead.
The singe player is ok ig?"
All video games are abhorrent and DooM is one of the most nefarious examples
ill pass not fun.
"Mechanics are a lot less fluid compared to DOOM Eternal, difficulty curve is simply inhumane (even though I did play on Nightmare, getting oneshot from full HP feels incredibly unfair and unrewarding -- something DOOM Eternal does not do, while still maintaining the signature challenging gameplay). 
Please do yourselves a favor and just play DOOM Eternal for the superior experience."
Die-Hard DOOM Fan since i was kid when the original came out. This is Okay. Not best DOOM but over all its a good game. Go Play Eternal and skip this one if you haven't played before.
Multiplayer really pisses you off
"Apparently they deleted my original review.

I had horrible input lag making this game unplayable."
"polished to perfection
non-existent story
okay gameplay
boring overcompressed music
2 fun guns, the rest are for a last ditch effort
green lights do the hand holding
acceptable optimization
AAA price
mere 8 hours of campaign (I played blind)
too easy and forgiving"
"Hmm, nah.

I'm old enough to have enjoyed the first two Doom titles when they came out. Doom II deathmatch was among the first titles I've played over a dialed 14k4 modem.

I thought this one would have anything that resembled the atmosphere of these early titles. It doesn't. While the ancient titles were dark and gritty, this one is just... cartoony. 

Game mechanics are also meh. Pseudo-rpg elements were included but are stupidly lackluster. gun play is unfortunately just not satisfying, and you're either moving around way too fast to even stop and notice the enemy or you're wasting time while mindlessly shooting inoffensive zombie-like dudes who won't fight back.

tl;dr: not total garbage by any means, but not good either and a title I could have easily passed without any loss.

ps: soundtrack is pretty good though."
"bad, this game gave me nausea"
"Got to the part where I'm supposed to go to a security station to open a door that is between me and the objective. Map doesn't say what is what, just a bunch of blank rooms. Of my time playing 50% was spent looking for where to go, 20% trying to make sense of all the pop ups/info dump, and maybe 30% on actual gameplay. They throw a bunch of info at you, but no hints on where to go if you get stuck, would not recommend for new players. There's a chance I'm just a moron, but I do not appreciate getting stuck in a game and having 0 clue of where to go to progress."
"game crashes randomly when loading, corrupting save game making you have to start a new game was 7 hours in when this happened do feel like starting over again when there still is no fix"
"One boring and chaotic game. The upgrade system seems fun, but I don't wanna explore this dull boring world. I've seen worse, but it's still straight bad. 2/10"
booooooooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggg. Get it on sale and waste your life for nothing.
"Not recommended, as it requires to accept an EULA… *after* downloading the game…"
"Lacks the action-atmosphere of the original, plays more like Doom3 then Doom 1 or 2."
"Toxic masculinity in a nutshell

How do we force these cis white pigs to add BBW and sodomites to the game?"
"Make no mistake, Doom is certainly not a bad game. But would i recommend it to a friend? No. Doom 2016 simply isn't what I expect from a good FPS. It's too convoluted, boring the player with its upgrade and rune system, which boils down to limiting the players ability in the first levels. A Doom FPS should be about skill, not not about paternalizing the player.

Apart from that, Doom 2016 lacks the run, gun and dodge spirit the original and Quake made so gut wrenching fast and uncompromising. You are slow, a walking tank brawling its way through the levels, forced to get into close combat basically all the time. It took a while until i realized that something irked me - which turned out to be a lackluster implemented hit feedback. I only realized i got hit severely, when my health was already down to being a one hit, which defied any attempts of health management. 

And that's not an oversight: The devs wanted to force the player into the glory kill system, basically taking away the choice of an indiividal play style. When Doom 2 gave you the choice to go in OR keep your distance, Doom 2016 forces you to go in.

But what really took the fun away from me, are the ubiquitous arena combats. Basically Doom 2016 is an arena shooter: You walk into a confined space, doors shut behind you, monsters spawn in.

Spawn in.

Say good bye to any atmosphere, to any need of paying attention to your environment. It's not necessary, as the level designers never even decided to worry about monster placement. Why planning ahead if you can spawn in monsters AND supply the player with ammunition via chainsaw kills? That's lazy, uninspired and in stark contrast to the quality of mods still produced for Doom and Quake up this very day.

Not that the modding community has a chance to prove better with Doom 2016: It's nailed shut, only offering the build in snap map editor.

So my final verdict is: If you are fine with a polished, albeit rather generic FPS experience set in Sci-Fi and hell environment: Go for it. For five bucks you'll get plenty of shooting. But if you were searching for a spiritual successor for Doom or Quake:

Go to doomworld or quaddicted. And if mods can't sate your hunger, try our Wrath: Aeon of Ruin and mod it to your satisfaction."
"tbh its like wolfenstein with less story, great graphics fast paced but quite a generic shooter i could see me playing for about 20h and then not touching it for ages, used to love oldschool doom but this isnt for me"
Expected more cool game from Id software
"its probably good, it just makes me so fucking dizzy."
It's not really a shooter this is more like run and jump simulator. They should call it Quake 3: Singleplayer. Doesn't feel like Doom in any way.
"The soundtrack is killer, but the fact that there is never a time when there is not at least some sort of soundtrack makes it easy to automatically tune out the soundtrack and not notice it when it kicks into a good track. My other main gripe is that the sound feedback is very bad. Weapons that are supposed to feel powerful do not sound powerful, nor is their sound satisfying to hear when you fire them, ultimately making the game feel like you are winning because the opponents are weak, not because you are powerful. If you like arcade shooters then you will probably like the game, but I personally was quite disappointed in it, and cannot recommend it based on my experience (which is a shame, because the soundtrack really is awesome and I listen to it outside of gaming)."
"Ok, this is probably a pretty unpopular opinion, and I accept that, but this is still how I personally feel.

Don't get me wrong, DOOM 2016 is amazing in a lot of aspects. In fact, I got this game in sale just to give it a fair chance. Its graphics and music are simply amazing! The level design is decent as well. And while the gameplay is where I find most faults, I still have to admit that it's really smooth and user-friendly.

But, on to why I just can't like DOOM 2016. These are also the reasons why I just can't like the original Doom series either (with the exception of DOOM 3). Overall, the gameplay all boils down to a whole lot of 'jump>shoot>glory kill' repetitions, with a bunch of obnoxious searching in literal nooks and crannies if you care about the collectables. It's a game where you just turn your brain off and practically hold the W and left-click buttons (not quite that literal, but you get my point). There's no variation in its gameplay, no depth, just kick and punch and shoot all the way to the end. Add to that the almost non-existant storyline, and I really just can't bring myself to be interested while playing this game.

Overall, like I said, a lot of good aspects in DOOM 2016, but the constant gameplay loop and poor story just makes it a very boring game to me."
"If you own a razer keyboard & mouse
then dont even think about playing this game
since it will screw up your light effects each time you go play
and only option in game shuts all lights off instead = not better at all"
"The game is graphically slick and features a nice player skill/weapon progression system, with an incentive to explore each level fully.

However, at heart it's a dungeon crawl (set on Mars with guns) with most of the action taking place in set arena battles against waves of spawning enemies.

That's pretty much it.

If you like that sort of thing, I'm told that Doom 2016 is one of the best examples on the market.

As for me, I got stuck fairly early on in the game at a set battle that I couldn't survive. I came back to the game about two years later to try again, and found that I was still stuck. As a teenager, I could take on Doom 1 and Doom 2 on Ultra-Violent difficulty level and enjoy the challenge. As an adult in my middle age, I have better things to do with my time than keep dying repeatedly trying to prove myself the equal of a game designer's challenge.

Will our intrepid Space Marine hero survive the demonic onslaught on humanity's Tharsis base on Mars to triumph amid gore and plunder?

In a word: no. And that's the end of my Doom 2016 journey."
"Video Games are just horrible, theyre not even good"
"I was almost done with the Campaign by the time I couldn't handle this game bs, the further along you go in the campaign the more the game unravels and the worse it becomes. If I would've reviewed the game after my first couple plays where I hadn't even gotten half way through I would've left a great review but as I got further in the game stopped running well (missiles passing through enemies  taking damage when not hit explosive damage that I should be immune to damaging me certain elite guards being obsurdly difficult to get to due to not well tested secret spot design etc.). My least favorite are the runes beside being rng hell they were extremely buggy for me, hell knights would ground pound and damage me from long range and most projectiles would curve twords me some like the imp curve normally but I don't think the possessed soldiers energy shot curves. I bought this game on sale for 7 dollars and I kind of regret it, 23 hours of play time isn't enough to justify the hard drive space this thing took up,"
"Best shooter? Best shooter.

Edit: Bethesda is a trash company that will try its hardest to be a stereotypically villainous corporation wherein the rats in exec and management will try their hardest to sink their reputation and mistreat its employees for a chance to steal your leftover change.

What they did to Mick Gordon is one of the most base and insensible things I've seen come out of the games industry. Do not support this behaviour. Do not support their games. And for the love of what is good, do not support this conglomeration of reta.rds."
"I could go into a very lengthy review, telling you why I don't like this game.

Instead, I'll just say that I don't like modern shooters, and this is a bad shooter. Low skill, mindless enemies, and ""Rip and Tear!"" that while sounds cool at first, really just translates to a stupid idea at platforming. Brutal DOOM is frankly better then this, along with having better music, and the gunplay is unsatisfying.

The game overall in my honest opinion is perfectly ""average"" for a modern shooter, does nothing interesting or revolutionary, and overall is likely only popular because of the lack of decent singleplayer FPS titles and bringing the DOOM franchise."
"The game has so many issues I'm forced to give this game a negative review.

It has nice graphics and decent gameplay, but a lot of times it starts with the wrong resolution, sometimes it doesn't start all (eg: I play the game just fine but when I come back to play again a few hours later the game doesn't start), sometimes some keyboard inputs don't work; I know it's not a problem with my PC because other games run fine and none of the fixes I tried worked for this game. 
Gameplay has good things like being able to carry all weapons and fast pace but things like jumping puzzles ruin gameplay, rune trials are stupid and sometimes unfairly difficult even on the lowest difficulty settings, some levels feel repetitive, and certain aspects of multiplayer feel out of place in a Doom game such as restrictions on loadouts, the whole level up & unlocking stuff. Also the game requires constant internet connection to play custom matches against bots, which imo is a terrible design choice. Some achievements are glitched and don't unlock.

Unfortunately all the negative aspects negate any positives the game may have."
"what a piece of shit game ... Eternal is for kiddies ... this is a shit game .. and doom 3 yes that is a game ... i payd 20 euro FOR a shit game .. and i will not buy eternal i prefer patched ,,, FREE ... ""anyones"" first reaction when you install with a bug .. after the reinstall all gone 100% as it should ... this is present even in DOOM 3 in HELL again same thing there .. i must reinstal DOOM 3 to pass the level :)"
"I got this game because it was recommended to me as a somewhat newer game with decent graphics that actually has regular non-team deathmatch online play, which is hard to find anymore since the game companies seem to want to focus on team play.  Nobody is playing Doom online.  I can wait for an hour in the lobby and nobody shows up.  It doesn't matter what time of day or night, it doesn't matter what region I set, NOBODY shows up, making this game utterly worthless for multiplayer, which was the only reason I bought it."
"terrible compatability, doesnt work, multiple corrupted files, changes my aspect ratio, wont work on my screen, only uses 110 of the screen, cant fix, wouldnt recommend to myworst enenemy, never experienced this many problems from a single game in my entire life, atleast i could blow on my n64 cartridges, wont ever ourcahse anything from this developer again"
"It was really engaging until the game crashed almost every time I encountered a loading screen. Saw some suggested solutions online, couldn't get them to work. Unfortunately the joy is now as dead as the hordes of demons that lie behind me."
They didnt let Mick Gordon Finish his soundtrack  thats why
the cars in this game are bad... I hate driving... #zzzzzz
"The game crashes after you save the game and log out.  It will not let you load the saved game.  Also when you start a new game, it will only let you start three times and then you are locked out of the game with no possibility of starting a new game."
"The game is a console port, it's too slow. Moreover, there is no mod support and I can't use /timescale to speed up the game.
You are better off playing Serious Sam Fusion instead."
i cant play this game anymore since its not opted into GeforceNOW
"Eh, does not live up to the hype honestly."
"To be honest with you, I don't really like Doom that much, yeah it's fast paced but, I feel as if there's no meaning or substance to it. It's like a kid on drugs wanting to go fast. As sorry as this sounds, it's a no for me, I just don't like it. I cant get into it."
"I loved this game when I first got it. It was fun, fast paced, and chock full of hidden secrets, violence, and the stuff DOOM is known for. 
However, I do not recommend this game right now, as my not even month old PC, that is stronger then the PC I previously played DOOM on many years ago, crashed to a blue screen not even 30 minutes after loading up the game. Which never has happened to me before on any other game, on any other PC. Only DOOM 2016 has made me blue screen."
too much gore lol trying too hard to be edgy?
"Great engine but boring game, glory kills are dumb as fuck and most enemy encounters are happening in arenas, the soundtrack is the worst part of this game, most of the tracks are this one note garbage.

This game has no actual modding support, this is a doom game goddamnit, what the fuck are you guys at ID doing."
"I cannot understand why this game has such a positive reputation. Graphically it's pretty good, the frame rate is excellent, the sound is rubbish and it has to be the shallowest, most boring gaming experience I've ever had. I tried it on Xbox back in 2016 and didn't last long then. I recently built my first gaming PC and after reading all the positive reviews about this game I thought I'd give it another go. 

Waste of time and money. It is so simplistic it's sleep enducing. Back to Titanfall 2. Not that is a good game."
"Functional singleplayer, but underwhelming, and empty multiplayer.

It took a long time until I was capable of running the game smoothly. It looks good, but requires decent hardware. The singleplayer is a huge improvement in the series when compared to Doom 3, although it lacks detailed settings like an option for hold to crouch (and a button for grenades?) The audio could be improved, for example some of the explosions sounded like a quiet sneeze. The gunplay had some satisfaction to it, but not as satisfying as the guns in Killing Floor 2.

The campaign didn't grip me at all. It felt unintuitive; I frequently got lost or couldn't figure something out and had to watch a playthrough, but the playthroughs weren't much help because a lot of the game looks the same, so there's not much of a reference point like landmarks to help navigate yourself. There's an in-game map, but somehow it just felt equally as confusing.

I wasn't eager to keep playing it. I actually felt tired from aimlessly strolling around what felt like a badly lit maze that all looks the same, hoping to stumble on a keycard, while being slowed down by menu popups for weapon/suit upgrades that I didn't feel interested in. Certain things were confusing, like killing with a chainsaw drops ammunition that can't seem to be picked up?

The base gameplay is refreshingly straightforward in a lot of places - just let the player progress and give them new guns and things to shoot. But it wasn't that interesting. It's almost a little bit too brainless (when it wasn't outright confusing), as I don't feel like there's much skill involved. It's possible to do interesting things in a game that has simple foundations (like Half Life) where there are clearly lots of skillsets involved.

It's like Doom wanted to capture the original fun of shooting demons in Doom, but also add a storyline, but it fails completely because you can't just jump in to do some shooting. Now you have to be slowed down by the story, but the story itself is bland and forgettable. The graphics are impressive, but if that's the only selling point then it doesn't offer much value.

When I tried the multiplayer there was only one other player, and it didn't start a match. I'm pretty neutral on this game, I'd recommend to try it if it was free, but honestly for £14.99 i think you'd find better value elsewhere. It's not groundbreaking like the original namesake was. Killing floor 2 probably had more playability and a greater variety of weapons (and a more active playerbase).

I felt like it was supposed to be a prominent title, but it doesn't meet the hype."
BAD
"I've been a huge fan of DOOM even including DOOM 3. To me, this game was pretty boring. 

Move into a room, room locks, bad guys spawn, kill bad guys, room unlocks, move to the next room... Repeat with (maybe) a new kind of bad guys. 

The graphics are decent and if you just like to shoot and shoot and shoot (and shoot...) then I guess this game is for you. If it goes on super-sale for $3 or something, I might buy it again. There just isn't enough substance to justify full price.

EDIT: And I did, in fact, get it on super sale after getting it refunded when I left this review. I'm happy with it for $5 but would not recommend paying full price for it in the slightest."
"It looks good. It sounds good. I thought I'd like it. I wanted to like it. But I got bored. It felt like a tedious, repetitive slog. It was almost there but maybe they made too many concession to modern gamers. I don't know but I'd rather play the Brutal Doom mod for old-school Doom. I can't recommend this for fans of the original."
it's so booooooooooorrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiing
SHIT
"Not sure how this game managed to get so many positive reviews - it forces you through 6-8 hours of unskippable wave combat, followed by an obnoxious puzzle. The community will most likely defend it, but this is insulting game design."
"The most boring FPS game I've played in a long time. After playing for a little while, I had to remove the game once again after having installed it twice. You just follow the path, fire generic monsters, and press F to finish them and collect health and ammo, then repeat till the end. There is no storyline, only a few cutscenes, and the enemy AI is braindead. The game will quickly get boring for you."
"Great Soundtrack
one hit wonder with mishandled multiplayer"
"i remember my first gameplay of doom 3 this was first doom game which i played it on xbox console, the experience was scary but at same time ass kicking it gave you certain feeling that you were actually in hell fighting demons, now days its just arcade type of gun and run boring repetitive with no scary moments, every boss fight is seems like made for 3years old kid who can rip through them but game itself is visually very good and eye candy thats all in this now days doom game can offer, the game has lost its meaning and is not according to its name what its meant to be  you no more feel like your ""DOOMED"" to hell.!!!! thats why i gave thumbs down"
"Its shit and the shotgun is trash and underwhelming. Don't buy it buy eternal

Shit ass game waste of fucking money"
gets boring fast
"i finished the game the first thing i have to say is this game is not bad ! 
it is good but  i dont like it 
you know when you see a game and think yeah this is a good game but  i dont feel i will like it no mater what"
"Don't buy this game, because it's Bethesda.

It's too bad, because this was a fun game. I had fun playing it.

But Bethesda has too much of a history of fucking over their customers, both when the game's released _and_ after the fact. I can't recommend anyone buy a game from them, because I don't know how they might screw you over in the future, and I don't want to encourage people to support a shitty company.

If I could give you my copy of this game, to avoid someone else purchasing it, I would."
:(
"I honestly could not have much fun with this game. I know everyone thinks very highly of it, but when I played it was just another basic shooter with slow movement. Is it polished, yes, but It's an experience I can get anywhere else. It's just shoot bad guys in one room and move on to the next, nothing that groundbreaking or enjoyable for me."
"Doom (2016) is the best shooter and the worst AAA game of decade.

Thanks to my huge backlog of games i was unable to finish this game till now, despite the fact that i bought it way back at release day... So there are my [strike]shitty[/strike] [i]trashy[/i] review:

- The graphics here is pretty simple (vs old ass Crysis 2/3 for examle) and the hell just feels like some kind of hellish planet but not a terrifying world of pain and agony. The UAC-facilty level design is just a lazy copy/paste by 70-80% with some [i]trashy[/i] platforming jump puzzles and the hell is a copy/paste by 90-95%.

- And these gameplay ""loops"" where you just repeat the same actions over and over until [strike]your eyes bleeds[/strike] they let you leave the room - it is so lazy and stupid idk what to say.

- Music. Heh, i'd say it also [i]trash[/i] but i'm not a heavy metal fan anyways.

- Even that primitive story is a [i]trash[/i] too, i finished this game only to see nothing at the end. And i mean literally nothing, just one dead erm... one dead boss.

That ending did not give me a sense of completion but a feeling of frustration. Open ending you will say? More like [i]trash[/i]-ending. Now i am supposed to buy Doom Eternal to see the real ending? Nah, play that aswesome game without me.

I don’t even understand why is this game is so highly rated. Just because of the shooting mechanic? Well that would be too generous. Must be not my kind of game. Or i am an alien. From dem Mars!

4/10, okay 5/10 at max

[i]Sincerely, your Quake 2(!) and Doom (2004) fan.[/i]"
"They forcing update with virus anti-cheat on doom eternal. That is why I can not recommend any of their game.
NOT SURE IF I EVER BUY ANY GAME FROM THEM IN A FUTURE"
"Incredibly repetitive and boring, a lot of jumping and bugs. I thought nothing could be more boring than doom 3, but hey, id managed again. Finishing daemon can end up you with falling through the textures and die. Utter rubbish."
overhyped bethesda trash
Shitty checkpoint system and lack of quick save make this a no go for me.
"I really tried to enjoy it once. After a while I tried again. I just can't... It's extremely boring for me.
I don't like constantly caring about ammo and the idea of approaching and watching same finishers to recover health. I watched some late gameplay on youtube and it looks differently, but I'm not going to sacrifice."
"honestly unbeatable, what the hell... they broke it with updates, and hehehe, seriously you get to a point in this and just climbing a wall makes death, lol... emm hahahaha, can I have my money back please ? :)... lol... I asm playing on ultra violence but they took away all my weapons, all my upgrades, am near the end ... it is not the demons killing me, lol.... I destroy them... even with just a pistol, hahaha... but ummm, I climb something and screen goes red and says I died.... emmmm.... hahahhahaa... learn how to code bethesda, so tired of this"
"Tried to play this game twice. I forgot why I only lasted 3hrs the first time. Until I just downloaded it again. The start of the game is extremely boring. I cannot attest to further than 3hrs in, but it doesn't deserve more time imo. The starting weapon does nothing except stun / stagger. Therefore you are constantly having to stagger and press F to do some ""special effects"" melee kill which consists of punching or poking their eyes out. Very repetitive. The next weapon they give you is a shotgun. Great right? No. Point blank range and it still staggers instead of kills 90% of the time. To top it off they only give a max of 20 rounds so you are constantly searching for ammo. The first upgrade for a weapon you get is about 30 mins in and i chose a more focused shot from the shotgun. A charge shot where it concentrates the blast. I was hoping this would at least kill something. Yet again, no it doesn't 1 shot kill. Still 20 round max - still looking for more ammo so I can 2 shot every enemy, or press F for more of the same 2 or 3 visually animated kills. To top it off the new upgraded shotgun has about 3-4 seconds in between each shot. So you have 5 enemies attacking you and you have to wait 4 seconds between charged shots. I'll go find another fps where a point blank shotgun can kill your typical entry level enemies."
"Now, how would you like [u]Denuvo anti cheat[/u] in your single player Doom 1, 2, 64 and 3 ?. [h1]You don't.[/h1] 

SO LET ME PLAY DOOM ETERNAL SINGLE PLAYER WITHOUT IT! [h1]I DON'T DO MULTIPLAYER[/h1]"
"The combat music just doesn't play. there is minor build up when demons spawn in, and then just ambient ""world noise"". Very poor considering the reason I bought the game was for the soundtrack"
"Wasted 20 dollars because my OS can't run it and I can't refund it because the policy, the game is good, the refund policy isnt"
"After years of buying this game. I really had high hopes for it. ran like shit on pc. 
My gaming rig can handle all AAA games.
Sadly this game couldn't get past the 16fps mark. no matter what setting I had it on."
"Kinda boring

Shoot wait for shiny then punch then repeat it too many times, some visuals are cool and the soundtrack is good."
"The game sucks ass. It is so repetitive that it will make you lose actual brain cells. Shoot at enemy, wait for shiny animation, press super cool execute button and watch one of three execution animations that you will see around 500.000 times during your playthrough. Rinse and repeat this in Maps that have absolutely no charm and all look the fucking same. The guns feel weightless and gunplay is incredibly bad for a game that only has gunplay going for it. The music in this game is laughable and is supposed to make you feel like the ultimate badass. In reality, it makes me feel ashamed for playing this. As you probably already know, the ""story"" is total garbage and can barely be described as a story, but I guess that is part of the franchise. Rarely was I so disappointed by a game, and I only had mediocre expectations going into it. Even if you are just looking for an FPS Game to shoot at some shit, which is what I was doing when buying the game, then this will still be a disappointment due to the bad maps, cringey music and the unexciting weapon handling.

If you are not a DOOM fanboy and you like to have your brain stimulated at least a little bit while playing games, then this won't be worth your time.

Edit: Its 2023 and this game is still one of the most painfully overhyped games I have ever seen."
It's boring.
"Lets play DOOM. its parkor with constant double jumps , then fight demons in a arena till  their dead, then hit button to open door to new parkor place , then shoot demons in arena till all are dead to activate button to advance to new parkor challange. the defend against demons in a arena ...........ete."
"Deliberately corrupting save files for using the dev console or using any kind of cheats is the most obnoxious pathetic shit I have ever seen from a game developer.

If they think this game is such a work of art that people cant possibly be allowed to mess with it... well they're dumb as hell. The game is just kill the monsters in a room, door opens, repeat for 8 hours. Sure its fun. But why cant we cheat? Why are the developers so precious?"
This game is not Doom.   I don’t know what it is.  You play Masterchief in CoD style combat with Mortal Kombat finishers.
"There were 3 times in the game where i truly enjoyed myself, and they were all times i clipped out of the map with a glory kill"
"If you like platformers. Weee, jump, jump, jump, solve puzzles and die in fire-filled cramped levels. I thought this was a game about shooting demons. Seriously by the time I got to the foundry, I quit. Not even enough interest to get to see what cacodemons look like."
"This is a brain-dead power fantasy. If you're looking for an exciting and terrifying game about the battle against demonic legions from hell, don't buy this. Instead get Doom 1 & 2 and download the ""brutal doom"" mod. If you prefer a game where there's no sense of danger because your enemies are more like annoying little mosquitoes than scary, deadly monsters...play this. I found it very disappointing."
"It should be ""It's ok but"" but Steam reviews as binary as Heaven-Hell concept.
I was forcing myself to complete it so I can give my opinion. You can definitely get it on discount.
What is wrong?
- for arena based shooter you stuck on geometry too little too much
- some arena design is so limitng for your awareness to enemies or for your movement I wonder how they managed to slip into the game
- level design sometimes could be a little confusing without a map, this guys should learn a thing or two from Valve
- power-ups look so unremarkable you can often easily miss them as they blend in with surroundings
- pinkies can soak a little too much damage
- cacodemon placement too often happens right on top of your head
- after a cyberdemon boss it basically a walk between two other bosses. I don't know why they crammed three bosses in such a short period of time

Fully charged gauss is your friend, on normal it one shots: hell knights - head, cacodemons - eye, pinkies - maw (I guess) and probaly something else I couldn't bother to test
---------------------
Тут должно быть ""Нормально, но"", однако, обзоры Стима такие же двойственные как концепция Рая и Ада.
Принудил себя закончить, чтобы выразить мнение. По скидке однозначно можно брать.
Что не так?
- для шутера с аренами слишком часто застреваешь в геометрии уровня
- дизайн некоторых арен настолько ограничивает отслеживаемость врагов или простор для движений, что удивительно, как они попали в игру
- без карты дизайн уровней порой запутан, им стоит поучиться кое-чему у Вальв в этом плане
- усиления выглядят так невыразительно, что их порой не замечаешь на фоне окружения
- пинки могут принять слишком много урона
- какодемоны часто размещены так, что падают практически тебе на голову
- после босса кибердемона ты по сути прогуливаешься между двумя другими боссами. Не знаю, зачем они впихнули трёх боссов в такой короткий промежуток времени.

Заряженный до конца выстрел гаусса твой друг, на нормальном он ваншотит: хеллнайтов - в голову, какодемонов - в глаз, пинки - в пасть (я так думаю) и вероятно еще кого-нибудь, но мне было неинтересно проверять."
"Overall, the game is meh, so I wouldn't recommend against it, but it is plagued with infuriating stuff that makes me wonder what the hell happened in the dev team and who came up with those designs.

-The game is too easy, even on ""nightmare"", and...
-Will not let you play on the highest level of difficulty on the first run, obviously
-The progression system on the last level of weapon mods and runes makes you play in absurd ways to unlock them
-The story is uninteresting at worst, silly at best
-The game won't let you save your progress, which wouldn't be such a big problem if the next point wasn't a thing
-The game forbids you from backtracking sometimes with locked doors and will not warn you when it happens, forcing you to restart the level if you want to find remaining secrets
-Glory kills are annoying after the first one and stop the flow of the game, yet...
-Glory kills are mandatory for some challenges, and...
-Some glory kill challenges require you to perform a specific one on a specific part of the body of monsters with a specific orientation, distance, and timing, 5 times on the level
-Glory kills do not provide any invulnerability frames after you perform them, so sometimes you just die after doing one
-You can accidentally restart the level and lose all your progress after you die (annoying glory kill challenges included)
-Did I mention glory kills is a terrible mechanic?
-That's just me, but I don't like metal and electric guitars and it makes my ears somehow cringe

If that doesn't stop you from wanting to play the game, you'll probably enjoy it, it is kind of DOOM after all. However, you could also try out old DOOM-like games instead."
"Classic Doom: Doomguy is fast as hell, he even circle-strafes slow monsters and shoots them before they react.
This Doom: Monsters are fast as hell, they even climb on walls, and run around doomguy to shoot in the back before he reacts.

Classic Doom: Vivid color pallete of surrounding gives more contrast to blood and gore.
This Doom: Everyting is colored red and yellow, so that blood is less noticable and it's more appropriate for all ages.

Classic Doom: OST with melodies from speed and heavy metal of 80's and 90's, give more edge to the experience.
This Doom: Yeah, brutal and powerful riffs, but the soundtrack is even more slow than the doomguy. And soometime it sounds like a Mochael Bay movie.

The game is okay-ish, but still I prefer ol' cup of classic."
"warning for unfixable glitch that breas coding in controllers as well as locks your mouse to the screen
good game if it was funcunal... disapointed more than anything"
"Good day reader

I would like to start off with saying that this game took me 0,7 hours to beat. Therefore this is a waste of your money.

Rating: Easy / 10"
It poopoo bad
"Bored to death. 
Uninstalled after less than 1h. Advance, shoot, advance, shoot. I know doomer don't care much for a story, but they could have provided a bit of background to try to make it worth to play. Only good point is that it runs smoothly on a quite old computer. 
Too bad I can't ask for a refund."
bad game. doom 3 better
"Can't jump far enough. Got the boots, looked up user advise, still got hung up in 2 different places where I could not jump far enough. Some bug in the program"
"It gets really boring, there's only so long you can shoot demons until it wears off"
"The shooter for the console babies. You can't save. Because consoles can't save. You're doomed to check points that kick in every now and then. Bethesda - as incompetent as they always are - think that suspension is maintained by hiding the checkpoints. They are wrong as they always are. It doesn't help, really. ID Software is a pale ghost of its former glory - all the people who made magic in the 1990s are long gone and the people remaining are brainless corporate drones.

And that shows in the game. It's Call of Honour: Medal of Gears: Console Shooter for brain dead customers who never played Painkiller and this might think that shooting waves of enemies while being locked into a room or few rooms is ""unique"" gameplay.

This is not a DOOM game despite what some ""journalists"" or Youtubers claim. This is a brain-dead console shooter that is identical to Call of Duty or Medal of Honor, they just changed the textures to make it look different. And they didn't even bother to do that properly. Textures are poorly laid out, meshes break into the environment. It's appalling and honestly, insane, that a game made in 2016 cannot keep up with a game made in 1993. That's how badly Bethesda is screwing their customers.

Google Brutal Doom and play the  original again. You'll have more fun than in this extremely limited arena shooter that fails even to pump up the adrenaline."
"its fun, but play eternal."
"Just mediocre. Half the enemies looked like they belonged in Quake which was meh, despite the rest looking very well done. Only additions I cared for were the secondary weapon fire of several guns, everything else was standard. 

Primary reasons it gets a negative is I fell through the plane of existence (glitch) too many times and got snagged way too often on door ways and stair wells. Literally full stops in mid combat resulting in death. Just some funky collision going on with the player and the ground in common areas and it's extremely noticeable. And of course hype. It's average. It's worth playing but it's average and everyone and their dog are acting like it's the greatest thing to ever sweep past their faces. Visually sure, it gets the props (Minus the quake ripoffs and the horrible redesign on the Imp), and some unique choices in gun fire, but literally everything else about this game was average. Grabbing ledges felt more overdue than a nicely implemented mechanic which I was really hoping would be some intense parkour mechanics. At least the ability to slide under things. something else. Just meh. Worth playing? Sure, but it's pretty standard as far as an FPS experience goes."
"bs, this game is full of glitches, fall through platforms, randomly die when there are no enemies around, get stuck in areas if you die because you need a key card or something and once u get it once it dosnt come back if you die. wish i could get my 34.99 back."
Keeps on telling me fatal error. Only for this game no other ones. dissapointing
This game is a pain in the ass. It's a shooter on a mission. But they give you terrible clues that take forever. Plan on wasting a lot of time while having fun in brief spurts.
boring
Not as good as Brutal Doom
"Quake 2 is the ketchup on spaghetti, great game, makes me happy.

Doom 2016 is just pasta. No ketchup, no meat. Raw pasta. Pasta made for console players.

Yeah yeah yeah, Quake is not Doom, but I don't like the game. 

Quake 2 is like sex while Doom 2016 is like masturbation."
crashes for literally no reason. bethesda seal of approval
"I just don't get it.  How does this game get this many positive reviews?  I guess I am not a student anymore and have matured past games like this.  Far Cry, Crysis, F.E.A.R., Call of Duty, I found them so much more enjoyable and at least a little tactical and thought provoking.  Lucky, I only paid 6 bucks for this."
Not much to say just seemed to arcadey like.
the game is good NO IT FUCKING ISNT I FUCKED MYSELF IT IS FUN BUT NOW IT WONT EVEN FUCKING LAUNCH AND FOR 20e I WAS EXPECTING MORE.so this game is a fucking money grab and if it works on other pc why cant it owrk on my fucking pc why can i not enjoy this game what have i dont to deserve this + WHEN IT FUCKING LAUNCHES IT GETS FUCKING CORRUPTED WHEN U REACH THE EXITING PART AND FUCK ALL THAT THINK THIS IS A MASTERPIUECE BECAUSE IT IS AN UNFINISHED AND UNPOLISHED PIECE OF FUCKING HORSE CUM AND U CANT DO NOTHING ABOUT IT AND IT ONLY WORKS ON INTEL SO IF U HAVE AMD U BETER STICK 20e UP UR ASS AND RUN AROUND THE STREET SCREMING FUCK TOD HUARD AT LEAST IT CANT GET CORRUPTED BUT U CAN GET ARRESTED WHICH IS WAY FUCKING BETER THAN GETTING A FILE CORRUPTED EVERYTIME U LEAVE THE FUCKING GAME AND ID RATHER GET A DICK UP MA ASS THAN PLAY THROUGH THIS GODDAMN GAME AGAIN SO IF U WANT IT GO FUCK URSLEF WITH TOD FUCKING HUARD AND THAT CUNT FROM ID SOFTWARE AND GO PLAY SKYRIM A GAME THAT DOESNT GET CORRUPTED OR WOLFENSTEIN THAT WORK ON AMD TOO LIKE I CANT FUCKING BELIEVE IT IT FUCKING WORKS ON AMD AND WHY CANT THE CUNTS MAKE THIS GAME WORK ON AMD TOO WHEN THEY USE THE SAME MOTHERFUCKING ENGINE FOR 11 YEARS NOW ITS FUCKING OLDER THAN MOST FORTNITE KIDS AND SPEAKING OF FORTNITE FORTNITE DOESNT GET CORRUPTED SO IF U DONT WANT UR SAVEFILES TO BE THE ROMANIAN GOVERMENT PLAY FORTINE BETER THAT THIS GAME AND IM SICK OF THE GODDAMN TODHUARD FANBOYS INFEDSTING THIS GODDAMN COMUNITY WHO JUST WANT HS DIK DEEP INSIDE THEIR GODAMN ANUS AND IM NEVER ISTALING THIS AGAING AND U CANN AL DIE IN SYRIA U FUCKING CUNTS AND IM GONNA BREAK UR FUCKING LEGS
Not a bad game. I just bought it to drool over the graphics. Same thing over and over. Gets boring after 20 mins.
666/10
It was fun at first then it got repetitive and boring
"Great game when I played it a couple years back, but now it launches to a black screen.  I tried several possible fixes: updating graphics card drivers (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 on Windows 10), verifying cache integrity, reinstalling, etc.

Will update this review when a solution is found."
"With a few good hours in, I can say so far this has felt kinda meh if I'm being honest. Combat's eh, demon designs are kinda cool, and the soundtrack is just there. If you like to be on the move, inserting your fist in the skulls of demons and an okay industrial metal OST, go for it."
"Not really my type of game. Don't get me wrong, the game feels nice and smooth but it is too linear. You feel trapped in little zones"
Meh
"If you have accessibility issues this game is not for you. I really wanted to like it and am a huge fan of the old Doom games so i genuinely feel crap for not being able to play this. The color blind mode literally just makes everything green, and there aren't anyways I've been able to find that makes things more visible and easier to see. The audio is not that great. The soundtrack is awesome though. Also if you use a bluetooth headset good luck getting it to work with this game. So again not recommended if your use case is mainstream."
Crashes on startup. Beware before buying.
Nu Doom Bad
"meh, prefer painkiller hell and damnation. Perhaps Arcade mode, story though? suuuuucks"
it does not work at all
"all ids games are having the same issue of telling you to buy it again until I can play this game without having to buy it again I cant recommend any ids game

ps I think it has something to do with quakecon"
"I understand that its a different type of shooter but i just cant play this game for more than 20 minutes before things start feeling like chores. Its just constant running and jumping around and getting glory kills to get more health and ammo. That's how it starts, thats what it is. 6/10"
"Dog shit game, capped at 200 FPS because of broken physics, plays more like a platformer than a shooter and doesn't get the point of a proper boomer shooter from id. Worst of all, other games rip off the bad ideas from this one."
"The gameplay is awesome. what is not awesome is after achieving mastery of all weapon add ons, having my save reverted to one that is 9 days old, losing all that progress..."
Shit
"Just meh...
Maybe I am too old to buy some SILLY STORY about demonic worshiping and invasion.
Maybe I am too old to enjoy NO TENSION (you just kinda play it through like Battlefield single player) at all where the only danger of scare comes from frustration of not being able to hit at something that is hitting you (super annoying ""gimmick"" to make it harder by glitches than by smart AI).
Maybe I am too old to understand why one can carry a chainsaw, 4 guns but only 3-4 clips of ammo.
Maybe I am too old to appriciate that there is NOT A SINGLE FLASHLIGHT on the whole planet.
Maybe I am too old to FIGHT ALONE over and over and over again (some games cope with teaming).

All in all very disappointed, would not recommend buying it even for 6 euros."
"Quit gaming 8 months ago. Bought a new car, I have an amazing new girlfriend, I make a shitload of money and I'm buying a house this spring. I party every weekend, I'm never home. I'm enjoying life. Do yourselves a favor. Stop trying to make gaming a career. It's cringe as fuck"
"You will lose your progress if you are not careful since the automatic save system is broken.
EPIC FAIL for a multi million dollar game.
I won't buy Doom Ethernal until I'm 110% sure the saving systems works fine.
Don't you worry about contacting Bethesda you won't hear from them back."
At this day and age it just feels like its not enough.
Really boring... dont buy it.
"Game is OK, nice product, but after the first few hours... you've already seen the whole game... gets old pretty fast and over stays its welcome... the grind was real
also story is meh... final scene showed a dude that i dont remember seeing before at all... wtf...
If you love Doom... maybe this game is for you... otherwise just play a demo and skip this
not getting eternal for sure"
For an action game is sure is linear and boring
"I went into this one with much excitement.  Indeed, it has some great action set pieces along with frenetic action and a great soundtrack.  Unfortunately what ruined it for me was the fact that between the action set pieces, it becomes a big puzzle as to where to go next on the map and this pulled me right out of the game.  In frustration, I had to consult YouTube walkthroughs several times to figure out where to go next and how exactly to get there.  I also found the overall difficulty to be a bit high and the checkpoint save system didn't help matters either.  In the end, I gave up on this one after playing just under five hours (most of that trying to figure out where to go next) and really have no desire to go back to it.  Uninstalled.  This was the only time that I ever asked for a refund on a game on Steam, which was denied because I played for more than two hours.  Will definitely be skipping on Doom Eternal."
"Very very weak design. Levels are repetitive, monsters are repetitive. The boss fights are not fulfilling - kill the first incarnation of the boss, then you get a second version you have to fight Wow - very original design. Bosses have the typical behavior of knock them down to 50% health and they introduce a 'new' attack. Except it looks like every attack in every other platformer since 1985.  

The levels all feel the same with areas you can jump to and climb up on, with the added bonus you get hung up on 'features'.

Go exploring, look I found some armor and health only to have monsters spawn in on the way out and you lose all the armor and some health so you're in worse shape. Very creative.

The constant monster spawns get tiresome and of course the battle escalates and so you can plan on having more powerful monsters spawn in at the end of the battle. 

The worst mechanic is the chainsaw - fuel is scarce so you don't get to use it much. 

The Titan fight was really bad - bosses that flip and roll around? This is Doom, not some PS4 anime knockoff game. 

Did the designers play the original Doom, because I did, and this doesn't feel like it. It's another generic FPS. It's going on 30 years later and this is the best 'game design' they can come up with?"
"I mean it's a title reboot, there's nothing new here. Grab this for extremely cheap - as it is worth at least one playthrough."
It plays like a bad quake game. Truly the Mad Max: Fury Road of video games in the worst way possible.
Crashes most of the time... Settings are minimized... and can't even play anyway since it crashes at loading screen..
"There is no satisfaction in pressing G to make demon explode. Predictable arenas with spawning enemies like a 90's JRPG overworld. Yawn.

I appreciate the lore and worldbuilding and design, but everything about the game says ""go as fast as possible"" and it makes me feel like I'm missing out if I stop and take my time.

After trying to play through this twice, I think it's just not for me."
"I started playing in nightmare difficult and at first it felt ok, dying several times but then i got the pattern and the game turned into. ""Shoot at their feets, then glory kill, climb a wall, shoot at their feets then glory kill...goto 0"" Game turned into a sleepwalk, completed stage 1 and had enough.

A game shouldn't require me trying to convince myself that i had fun, didn't felt like the difficult was increasing, once i got to lvl 2 it was just a spamm of useless zombies and more of the same monster, dunno if the entire game is slow like this but i was expecting some fast phased madness. Even quake 2 felt better than this.

I think they just wanted to make the game some sort of cinematic or whatever with some background story nobody asked and a bounch of coward demons that spends more time climbing and jumping away from fight than actually doing something, just disable music and play this on background and it feels more apropiate
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pct1uEhAqBQ

Had more fun in wolfestein 1 than this but at least i bought it on some big sale."
"Saai spel, kut mechanics"
Please no more
Fucking boring
"The only selling point of this game is the ""feel"" (physics, weight, umph) of the guns. If firing them for 10 hours straight while running in circles is enough to entertain you, Doom 2016 might be the right fit for you.

For gamers who want interesting level layouts or anything besides dime-a-dozen arena shootouts, hard pass. Don't spend money on this. Everything looks cool, but that's a facade; the core game isn't nearly as engaging as it wants you to believe it is. When you're close to death, it's stressful, and when you're far from death, it's boring. At its best, it's mind-numbingly hypnotizing. At its worst, it's a regression of the very genre it hoped to reinvigorate. Seriously, the final mission is a cliche, painful gauntlet level with a ""deactivate the three generic things"" structure. Yawn. If that doesn't say it all, nothing does.
  
Edit: Multiplayer is fun, though, when you can find matches."
"I'm about 1/3 through the game and its not bad. Played other games that are better but for a non-open world game style, i would have given it around 6/10. 
The hard to reach/find collector toys i can understand putting in strange places but as the game progresses they tend to be found in places that are designed to hide them intentionally. 2/10
Then we find some runes. These seem to be interesting but quickly find that these wont really be anything worth useful until the game is nearly completed. 3/10
Then to get the runes themselves the Dev's thought it would be hilarious to put a 5sec or less time table. Ok, i can see that but killing stuff doesn't allow for stacked time. you kill 5 things in 3 secs, your time gets reset back to 5 sec. 1/10
Then they give you the slowest reload time in a gun compounding the issue. 1/10
To make things worse, they slow down time/environment at 1 second. If you're jumping, you wont make the jump, if your trying to (quickly) reload, you're not going to make it. 1/10
After replaying the same map for 8+ times, and you're near the end, screen goes full orange. prompt tells you lost internet (i'm hardlined by the way) and that whole 15 min or so of cursing at the screen, ya you get to do it all over again. -50/10
DON""T FORCE GAMERS TO BE ON THE INTERNET ALL THE TIME!! -100/10
Update:
Its the gift that keeps on giving.
Near the end of a map, won't spoil the fun in telling you which one, you are greeted with an 'old friend'. Buyer beware, this is a one way trip even though the Dev's tease you with a FAKE elevator that would appear as if you could go back up and collect the missing toy collectible you missed. Some coder could have spent another 30 min of coding to make this happen. Only way to go back to collect retarded toy is to replay the enter level! And Dev's want me to pay for their next doom game... hahahahahahahahaha"
"game is fun and i would love to recommend it, however my save was corrupted twice on the last level after 20 hours of collecting and upgrading two times. this is a known bug and the devs have done nothing to fix it in four years."
"In general the game is great. Good story, excellent gameplay and overall good experience. My biggest concern, is that right now there is a bug on the FPS cap. I have a 144hz monitor and the game is stacked in 60 fps. No matter what I have tried so far (turn v-sync off, switch borderless to fullscreen, change engine, anything I have seen on forums). I don't get it how such a game developed by such studios still has this bug and I cannot find a solution. 
I will update it once I find a fix.

(P.S. I have Ryzen 2600x and radeon rx580)


Edit - 08/04/2020:

Somehow - don't really know how, I no longer have the fps cap issue, but since yesterday - I CANNOT load the story campain. I press continue, the game loads, and then it returns me in the menu. I tried format, re-install, changed drivers and Graphics API, nothing works.
Seriously the game is very fun to play and I want to play more but seriously at this point, I just can't. 
Such a pity."
"Save game corruption after getting through 80% of the game. Steam cloud backup for some reason is a save around 50% of the way. Tried loading external saves but keep getting corruptions messages. Really annoyed, seems tons of people had issues similar to this, no way I'm getting doom eternal after this garbage."
bethesda sucks massive wang
"Absolute garbage. Visually it looks good, which is expected of a modern AAA game. The rest of the game? Well this is all there is to it. Do you see an enemy? If so, shoot until 10000 nit yellow light emits from their body. Then walk up, press F, and watched the same canned animation you've seen thousands of times by the first hour. That is the only way to actually play the game. Gone are the days of shooting your enemies to death. Now you just rip a limb off them and beat them with it in a boring animation. If you don't press F on the enemies, you suffer as you will get less health boosts, ammunition, armor, etc. The game even grants you invulnerability during the canned animations! Low on health? Press F and then reap the benefits. Anyone who likes this game has never played the originals."
"This is bulshit, iv bought the game iv played like 84 min and we cant play it anylonger since you freaks moved it out from GFN"
COOM
meh
"Honestly? Not enough diversity. Very repetitive. 

I shouldn't expect much from a Doom game, where the sole premise is to shoot a bunch of hell demons with awesome weapons while techno-metal plays in the background. And I was still disappointed. As you can see, I put 14 hours into the game and finished it. It was not entertaining. I regret buying this even on sale. 

At least I learned a lesson about hype."
I played it and was kinda bored after an hour. Maybe one day I'll redownload and play the game but for now I just don't see what the hype was about.
"The game is sooo bo-o-oring. I played it two years back and couldn't finish. Now Eternal released and I wanted to recall why I haven't finished  this Doom. Now I understood.
The levels, the actions everything you do is so similar all the time there is absolutely no diversity. Jump up the cliff, jump down the cliff defeat monsters, go to next cliff. That's all. Story is boring it is absolutely not engaging. Equipment upgrades are not interesting. Those challenges everywhere. Challenge to get this, challenge to get that, too many challenges.
Most awful soundtrack I ever heard. 
The only thing I must admit - is a great optimization.
Played two hours today and deleting again. I think I need to put a mark somewhere - do not play in this again.
Of course there is no talk about buying Eternal. This Doom franchise is over for me."
The definition of trying too hard. Do people actually think this kind of thing is cool?
maaaaan i love satan
"Nothing like the old Doom games. 
It's literally a press [b]A for Awesome[/b] type of a QTE game. 

I don't recommend this game."
VERY REPETITIVE
"I know others arent as challenged as i am doing jumps. It seems like this is all its all about. i will probably play the game up to the betrayer if i can get to him again. If not, because of the constant jumping, i will most likely not play this game, and i will uninstall the game. Its my fault i cant jump, but this is too frustrating for me."
"Even in Hell there are Funkos. Especially in Hell? Anyway, this is appropriately banal for a game that imagines a dimension of Eternal Torment to look like Castle Greyskull on a wet Wednesday. Riffing off a game from 1993, it's a remarkable achievement from id that the gameplay is even more simplistic than what would be acceptable 27 years ago - walk into a room, the doors lock, you have to kill a repetitive roster of extraordinarily stupid enemies (in increasingly annoying numbers), the doors unlock, you walk into the next room, repeat, yawn. Sometimes there's a boss! We're spoiled. All this while some sub-NiN dirge farts along in the background like game devs have just discovered CD audio (ironically the Playstation Doom had way better ambience). The story...well who cares about the story? Not the writers certainly, copy/pasting various elements from every other FPS (""You have to stop the person doing the thing! Make sure you stop them doing the thing and don't arrive just a minute late so that they do it and the plot continues""). You can amass tokens to upgrade your gear, just like in every other FPS. There are save 'checkpoints' and laggy texture loading, just like in every other FPS (that has been optimised for console - how much did you pay for your 'battlestation', oh scion of the 'PC Master Race'?)

This is a lame, tedious, generic shooter that no-one would have given a toss about without the name. Given that only 30%-odd players have got the 'Knee Deep in the Dead' achievement for game completion I would suggest a lot of these glowing reviews are a noisy minority or weirdos trying to obsessively-compulsively level up their Steam account. Or worse, a portal to a dimension of Low Expectations has lazily yawned open and an infernal army of morbidly obese virgin gamers have waddled out, desperate to find commonality with other Mountain Dew-guzzling sexual inadequates by aggressively agreeing about sub-par shooters.

In summary, an appallingly dull game that has now put me off a) starting other games I was going to while away Coronaboredom with and b) modern gaming entirely. Does John Carmack not own enough Ferraris?

Rip (off)'n'Tedium (haha get it???????????)"
"I was there from the beginning of the genre this is just to say that I've played every ID software's major title to death All Dooms, ALL Quakes, Rage and many add-ons and modes to those games. DOOM 2016 I hate with passion. It`s a pity that ID Software was swallowed by Behtesda because we ended up with another attempt at Skyrim rather than a proper Doom game.
 I tried 3 times to try and like it but every time there was something different that just turned me away from it. This is my personal opinion - Bad soundtrack, Bad A.I. My Gawd the sound is so bad it`s just unbelievable. When monsters appear it`s like someone constantly is vomiting in your ear and there`s no telling from where enemies will pop up since this disgusting all consuming sound just overshadows everything. 7 times out of 10 I can`t even say what killed or where it came from for that matter. Bad Level design (lock downs which prevent you from exploring previous areas), Bad gunz sound,NO ATMOSPHERE. And you know what ? I think those little secrets with original Doom levels is just the developers trying to convince everyone how ""amazing"" that 2016 Doom is in comparison to the original. Just like them sayin' - ""Look and see for yourself how big of a progress we've made!"" Well yes and no - I just revisited Brutal Doom and believe it or not it has much more punch to it than this abomination of a game. 
 If you are a casual player without high expectations try and check it for yourself but if you consider yourself a connoisseur pass by you won't loose much.
* Update. As of 03/03/2023 I`m still unable to finish the game since it is so bad to my mind that I really have to force myself to play it (I`m hunting a particular achievement). I come back to Doom every once in a while but can`t endure more than half a level at one time.
 Now if I calm down and close my eyes and try to remember something memorable from Doom 2016 what do I see ? This stupid air bicycle taunt that's it. 
P.S. If you try to over pack the game with trivial features to please everyone the game consequently looses it's character. Just saw the release of Doom Eternal saw the same colour scheme I'm passin' this one too by."
Won't launch anymore. tried to reinstall and no luck. my game drive is not being picked up. installed on my main drive and still no luck.
"my pc shut down mid game and for some reason i now have no game progress and no hud when i tried to man up and try again fuck this piece of shit game fuck you for wasting my time and fuck you again for the sake of just fucking you, you piece of shit game, fuck you
i uninstalled and restarted the game.......i finally got up to where i left off, pc shut down randomly AGAIN!!! I LOST EVERYTHING A SECOND TIME THE CREATORS OF DOOM OWE ME HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK EEING AS THOUGH I SPENT THAT MUCH ON YOUR GAME FOR FUCKING NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!! FUCK YOU SO FUCKING MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Still a lot of cheaters around - and this is why I am not going anywhere near Doom Eternal..

There are plenty of very good players.. 
However, you still get players that are running around at a much faster speed than everyone else ALL THE TIME. Some also have ridiculous movement in the air (A level above having Thrusters) and often kill you with one shot.. Others are lagging (deliberately) as they run around - making them almost impossible to hit.

You can tell a good player - and as mentioned, there are many of them.. The cheats are a level above and there are plenty of them..

If they still haven't dealt with Doom cheaters, they're hardly going to be any better for Eternal.. A Hard Pass from me.."
"I don't hate this game, but I think its the worst experience I've ever had. 0/10 DO NOT BUY"
"There are a lot of bugs unfortunately. I've died to so many bugs. UI for selecting praetor suit upgrades is also buggy, sometimes it selects upgrades my mouse cursor was nowhere near. I really doubt it's an issue with my pc too, running an i7-9700, 2070 super, 16gb 3000 ram. I feel like I've spent too much time trying to figure out a bug or find where a glitched out mob was for me to recommend as it's just frustrating and it happens nearly every level."
"You kinda have to entertain yourself in order to have fun. Very slow introduction to it's guns and mechanics. Just buy eternal, skip this one"
"Dogshit arcade mode, may be playing for 30 mins but if u clip on moving terrain you die and whole run is ended. 

As well, checkmarks are bugged in arcade mode and even somtimes in the campagain. One playthrough is more than enough the singleplayer is boring as shit. 

Arcade mode is the best but man is it BUGGY. Gameplay is fun. but most arcade levels are  brutally shit. 


sorry for spelling errors i cant be bothered."
my dad plays this game
-
"Doesn't launch at all and no way to contact support, I've tried all the fixes in the forums."
"Get it on Sale.

The only real reason for the negative Review is the Feature of Glory Kills Finisher. I expected fast paced Gameplay but anytime you can do a Glory Kill finisher why shouldnt you do it? So you do the Finisher but now your Gameplay Speed has come to a complete halt because that fancy Animation now has to completely play thru.
A Friend told me that you can get a Upgrade to decrease the Finisher time, but reaching that Point / skilling that Thing is still not a complete removal of Finishers.
Obviously you can just leave out the Finishers but now the Game becomes Bullet Sponges and low Ammo for you nonstop.

Good:
+Doom
+Music

Bad:
-Glory Kills Finisher"
"Unskippable 1 minute long title screen when the game starts, every time the game starts, and then game crashes and locks the whole PC. Completely unplayable."
its janky garbage from when it frist came out and even now
was loving the game until i got to the point where you get BFG and then my game crashed and would not let me on the save cried for a good 30 minutes
"I don't like shooters. I gave borderlands a try and ended up loving it so I thought I'd give this a try too since it goes on sale so often, but I didn't really grab me. Too bad because I've listened to the soundtrack and it's absolutely glorious."
"Heads up to any new players looking to pick this up since Eternal's release. Old bugs have returned with updates to this game
such as the good ol' black screen, so the game (mostly) works out of the box, but is iffy on whether it wants to actually give you video. Controller support also seem to be broken; I had to unplug/replug in the controller at every load screen for it to remember it was attached."
"great game but it has hidden features - when you play online on 4g, your weapons stop working at some point. When you switch to offline and play, progress, and switch back to online - your progress is puff, gone."
"Game crashed,  reboot, it just corrupted the saving files."
Where the fuck is toggle charge weapon?
"I've played DOOM multiple times, and I wish I could give a neutral / mixed review on Steam.
Compared to Doom 64, Final, Doom 3, and Doom 2016; I have played Doom I and II the most out of the three.

Let me explain what I do like about DOOM 2016:
- I love the controls. Running around is smooth and aiming is pleasurable being able to trace my cursor on enemies.
- The demons designs are spot on and love the details on the models. Great work on designing all the enemies.
- The graphics and atmosphere is good and makes me feel like I'm in the UAC, Mars, and Hell.

Minor issues I've had with DOOM 2016:
- The sounds on the weapons could use more 'umph' to them. More heavy, make them sound more powerful. Think of when id 'nerf' the thompson machinegun in RTCW by just lowering the sound.
- Gameplay is just okay. The shooting enemies with the guns provided feel kind of bullet spongy on harder difficulties. Would prefer enemies to change behaviors and more enemies to deal with than increasing the enemy's HP value.

Nitpicking:
- I'm just not personally into the music. I'm not into dubstep.
- Would like the final blow animations to be more like ripping and tearing of flesh and bone than ripping and tearing brittle paper. Sound overhaul might help with that as well.

Largest issue I have with DOOM 2016:
- The pacing. Unlike Doom I and II you can go room to room freely, pick up items, and kill demons on the way. You can choose to go back to the room you were in to find some items, go forward and kill some demons on the way,  or if you want from start to finish rush forward in a straight line, massacre demons on the way and rush to the exit.
(PS Doom I and II had an excellent manual that gave you the player some premise as to what is going on.)

In DOOM 2016 having to constantly be locked in a room, kill demons in an arena, demons respawn to where you have to kill them again, then finally having the room unlock to go to the next room to do it all over again can get very old. It breaks the pacing of the game restricting you from choosing how you want to pace your game.

I haven't played DOOM Eternal yet, but if the arena areas are limited to just a few to break the pacing in the game, that would be fine. Being in an arena every time throughout the game gets dull to me.

This is just my opinion of DOOM 2016. Like I've said I wish I could give a mixed / neutral review."
"Does feel like Doom. The guns are weak and the mosters too much a bulletspunge. 

Glorykills are fun, the first few times but afterwards they become a chore. But they look good in trailers and streams and that's all that matters. So it's a small sacrifice to [strike]criple[/strike] adjust the rest of the gameplay to facilitare them as much as possible.  Who in their right mind would play a First Person Shooter when they can play a First Person Brawler. We can only hope they will remove those annoying guns from the next Doom game.

Needs mods to be fun. https://www.moddb.com/mods/weapons-mod-for-doom-2016"
"So this game used to run flawlessly. At least it did at launch and a few months later. Then it mysteriously stopped running. I tried years later (now) and it always says to update your video driver. So I did that... Then reinstalled the runtimes it required... Nothing. Then clean install and nothing again. Then verify cache and, you guessed it! NOTHING. It says its driver related but it is clearly not driver related at all. some internal error was never corrected in the main programs code. I tried setting launch options to open GL and Vulkan and still nothing. I am fairly disappointed as this is the only game that has ever had this bad of an issue when it comes to just booting. I cannot recommend a game that has this big of an issue as its no longer playable. And yes, I tried it on multiple OSes. I verified the cache and rinse and repeated all the same steps. The devs decided to stop updating the game yet force it to be played with all the newest updates with no work around for that either. Meaning, the game is perma FK'ed! I am not sure if Bethesda is behind it as they have grown very lazy with many recent games, but it does stink of them. All other ID software games in the past still run like a champ."
"I just lost ALL the progression I made. Why? Because #bugs or #IdiotDevelopers
You s*ck, Id/Bethesda. You hear me? YOU S*CK!

https://steamcommunity.com/app/379720/discussions/0/357286119107723272/"
"I can't recommend this.

Previous Doom games allow you to save your progress any time without restriction. This game will only allow you to save at checkpoints.

So...something made 20 years ago has a better saving mechanic than something made in 2016. That is not progress, that's intentionally hindering a function."
SHITGAME
"KILLMOVE KILLMOVE KILLMOVE...
This game has nothing of the original Doom and tries too hard to introduce gameplay elements of newer games in it.
Its not doom anymore but instead a generic modern shooter."
"When the Doom Eternal came out I decided to try out this Doom and form my opinion about the new franchise. While the game is high quality, it has some questionable parts that you should consider before buying it. My first complaint about the game is its length. It is too short. I was able to complete the game in 7-8 hours. At the half-way of the game it became just repetition. New content does not appear quite often and because of that, when I was close to an end I was really bored and thought to myself: ""When is it going to end?"".
During game progression you will encounter several bosses. They are not particularly hard or have a lot of moves or special attacks or story that will make them interesting. So they are lame to me, because they just feel like mob enemies. 
From the gameplay perspective you will see all the game content before you reach half-way of the game. As I said before it just becomes repetition after that point. I hadn't had much fun due to that.
OSTs are great, sometimes during fights it synchronizes with the gameplay and it feels fantastic, but there are not enough of these moments.
Multiplayer part is not really bad. I would say it is good.
Overall, I am quite disappointed by the lack of content and what the game offers. Even though it has a lot of cool Easter eggs and some small contents, the game feels a bit lacking something. So in my opinion if you are interested in a good game progression with enough content to not make you feel bored, you shouldn't buy this game."
"The base gameplay is alright. The shooting is fun enough, and the very well-made animations never seem to become tiresome to watch.

Everything else wasn't done right. My biggest gripe is exploration: while the game starts strong in this regard, soon enough the level design becomes nothing more than a series of gauntlet rooms that are connected by one-way drops and doors, even though there is absolutely no reason why they need to be one-way. If you decide you want to go back and look for some secrets, you have to restart the entire level (and sit through all the unskippable cutscenes again!). It doesn't help that there are no manual saves, only checkpoints; and there are plenty of bottomless pits to fall into, so if you are the sort of person who prefers to explore every nook and cranny over using a guide, get ready to restart from some annoying checkpoints lots of times. Also, one of the collectibles uses a reference to the original game, so if you never played that, you are very unlikely to find it.

The challenges feel more like fetch quests than challenges. Annoying chores that discourage you to approach fights the way you'd want to. And on top of all that, most of the time you have to look at the game through a horrible looking piss filter. The original doom games used plenty of colours, including vibrant blues; in this one, you don't get anything other than gray and orange.

Don't pay full price for this."
"waste of money even on sale, ammo is impossible to find and system requirements are a lie. badly made in genral"
"Don't play this if this is your first DOOM game, I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this game even after buying it on sale. This game feels slow even though it was clearly made with the intent of being fast FPS with loads of action but it has too many load zones and too little demons to kill. The maps feel like mazes, I was focusing more on my map than killing everyone"
"Not my kind a game.
I tried this game 2 times and both times lost interest after meeting Olivia Pierce 
 ~ 2h ingame.

I feel like a big part of this game is searching for secret rooms that are kinda complicated to get into in order  to find keys that open doors which will allow you to progress the campaign....

50% of the time is shooting Monsters while the other 50% is trying to figure out ways to get to rooms that have keys for closed doors....

Just not what i want to spent my time on"
I can't get Doom to load it just crashes
"About 20 hours into it, the game becomes Donkey Kong.

Notice how so many positive reviewers from 2016 only have 15-20 hours in game in 2020?

Yeah.

Lots of fun and then you have this horrid bridge level where you jump from platform to platform like Donkey Kong.

It ruined the game for me at about 19 hours in. From reading the reviews from 2016, it looks like LOTS of reviewers quit at about the same place and after giving the game such a glowing review. Go figure.

Doom should be a demon stomping, bad-guy splattering type of game and Doom 2016 is all that, until it isn't. I'm in a level where there is nothing to shoot at, no demons to kill, only another long jump to another hand hold to another high place.

If I wanted a platformer I would buy a Nintendo and play Mario something.

This was a great game. I was having a blast. I ripped a boss demon apart with my bare hands and then... Donkey Kong.

If there is a mod to skip this level, it might make the game playable to the end. As it is, 19 hours in and dustbin."
Too little for the price.
"Horribly coded. Refused to start after adding a new monitor, save games frequently corrupted."
Very mid.
"I shouldn't have to spend hours hunting for solutions online to make a game launch. Still can't find a solution that works, can't play it. Not buying anything from ID again. at least I only wasted 2 dollars on this."
"The only thing good in this game is optimization I can run it 165+fps maxed out 1440p with 980ti i7 5930k and 32gb 2666mhz ram story and everything else meh

Since I can't review Doom Eternal gonna post it here don't buy it if you liked the first game the second one feels like a downgrade FPS is worse and graphics ain't better at all thank good I didn't buy it"
"The game's great. But for me, it was no inclusion of toggle between running and walking. Due to the running always on, you can't admire the atmosphere and could get lost easily. That's right this is a kind of game where you ask yourself ""where the heck do I go"" a lot. Adding toggle for walking can easily solve the disorienting problem that you get a lot while playing."
"we aware there are progress reset glitches still in this game even now in 2020, not going to play a game that just reset my progress."
"Will not launch saved game, level select, or even start a brand new campaign. Reinstalling 60gb of game data hasnt worked either and just results in the same thing... loops you back to the main screen where it advertises the new doom ultimate...

i guess iD and Bethesda will break your old game unless you buy the new shit... f that"
"Bugs on the second half of the game are actually innumerable. Mission near the end was bugged for me so I had to restart. Game is good obviously, people love it, but the bugs are actually extremely annoying. Specifically the bug that launches you around areas when interacting with terrain. It just did not stop happening to me and would cause so many deaths. Getting stuck on terrain in the middle of fights, really ridiculous. Honestly saw no reviews with this problem but it happened to me so just putting it out there. No one will care though. 

TLDR; Bugs in the second half of the game for me were insane, double jump is really bugged, terrain clipping happens alot"
"i've made a lot of progress on this game, found all of the easter eggs and secrets and the game restarted my game. didn't save or auto saved after getting all those stuffs! i don't want to restart and get all those secrets"
"Game crashed after a few hours of play and permanently corrupted my save file. There is no backup save, and I am unable to recover it. This has been a known issue since the game's launch and they haven't fixed it. Unacceptable quality from a ""AAA"" studio. I will never buy another ID game again."
"I normally don't at all enjoy serious-faced, gory, mid-octane, and all around intensely violent shooters, so it's rather a surprise that this one has won me over. But the controls are excellent, the combat is satisfying and presents a reasonable challenge, and it feels good to play, fail, and overcome. Even the highest difficulty feels satisfying and kind of fair, despite a permadeath mechanic that I don't personally enjoy.

There's also some incentive to explore if you like to, and that element is well done too, but Doom got me hooked more on the action.

The use of christian symbolism and allegory, though not particularly deep, can also be fun to think or talk about if you don't take it seriously (or if you enjoy taking it too seriously).



Why thumbs down? Bethesda doesn't deserve your money."
it dont start up
"I Reminiscing the days where I had to go through multiple chapters to complete the game.  I only was a cheap kid and played the demo.  This game I completed it and paid 60$ for the demo.  What is the game like?  Quake 3 Arena with a Doom Theme.  They put you in different areas, it turns into a cooperative deathmatch where its all of them against you.  No, that's not necessarily a bad idea.  My gut was tight in each match. 

It was enjoyable, but eventually the maps became bland, enemies were the same, the last boss was the boss from the first doom.  In the end all they did was added how many they could add to the map at once without it becoming too much.  Now Doom Eternal enters in as the second Chapter (see what I did there?) and they are demanding another bit.  Only less than 30% of players completed this game... 30.  Don't try to say it was a great game when only 1/3 of you completed the game.

Hate it or like this review. Facts are facts.  If you buy this you have a 30% chance of completing this game as other games are entertaining."
"After Doom 3, the atmosphere was so severely disappointing that I didn't make it more than a few minutes in. It was nothing like what I'd hoped it might be, no horror element at all - just a point and click shooter."
Kinda fucking boring after a while
"my save got corrupted 2 times not letting me finish the game after beating 3/4 of it, fuck this. also, thanks a lot for not fixing a bug that's 4 years old that resets your skill points and collectibles progress"
runs bad. might be just my system but not a good experience in that regard. other than that awesome game
"This game is such a shitty mess. Bethesa fix your fucking buggs, i cant even start doom twice without it crashing. What a shitshow, fuck you."
"MY SAVE DATA GONE!!!!!!!!!!!
HOW?"
"Literally unplayable at this moment. It's fun when it plays, but lately it changes all of my screens resolutions on start up, and will change it's own screen assignment and resolution as I'm in windows trying to fix the resolution problems it caused, WITHOUT ME EVEN TOUCHING THE PROGRAM! It doesn't matter what the configuration files say, it will always start at 640x480 on my SECONDARY monitor. That's not even the main problem. The main problem starts when I start trying to fix it. I change it back and put it on the primary monitor and set my resolution back to 1920x1080 (using its poorly placed settings menu... I mean seriously, it's not even in the main menu. I have to go to campaign, then my save file, THEN settings to get to settings.) then my secondary screen is still stuck at 640x480. Okay, fine. I alt+tab and go to windows display settings and set my secondary monitor to 1920x1080... or at least I try to. Now the second monitor is fine, but my third monitor is now at 640x480 and Doom has switched to it as its display monitor... and that monitor is in portrait mode. Windows is also freaking out and slowing down every time a change is made.

Eventually after enough monitor musical chairs, I have everything set up how it should be. Problem solved right? WRONG!

Now when I actually attempt to play the game, every time there is anything like action, I get massive amounts of ghosting on my screen. It looks like it's trying to display the same frame twice over except the second one is 1/4 seconds late. No settings combination or presets seems to mitigate this at all. My frames are still reading normal, so it doesn't seem to be performance related, with having it on low settings with the issue persisting supporting that observation. I also don't want to restart the computer or the game because I don't want to play monitor/resolution guessing games anymore, which has happened every time I have started the game except the very first time.

I am honestly just probably going to uninstall the game, and because of this I have no interest in getting Doom Eternal. I mean, it looks like a lot of fun, but I'm not going to pay $60 for a game that might not work or when it does, makes my eyes bleed while puking from motion sickness.

So far the only Ripping and Tearing this game has had me doing much of is my own hair."
...
"Paid for, eventually downloaded, constant Fatal Errors, unusable. feel ripped off"
"THIS IS FUCKIN TRASH!!!!!!!!!! FOR A GAME THAT START ONLY AT 640x480 PIXELS RESOLUTION (NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO) YOU SHOULDVE AT LEAST LEFT THE OPTION TO CHANGE THE RESOLUTION WHEN WE LOG, BUT NO, THATS THE ONLY GAME WITHOUT BUTTON FOR OPTIONS!!! AND IT AUTOMATICALLY START AT 640X480!!! COMPLETELY UNPLAYABLE GARBAGE LEFT BY THE DEVS!"
"It worked perfectly, when I lasty played it in 2018, wanted to play it again before buying doom eternal but its not working so im not gonna recommend this game to anyone. How do they ruin a game with updates?"
"This game is actually amazing, but DOOM Eternal blows it out of the water in every way. Play that instead, here's the link! 
https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/"
bad
cringey nostalgia bait rehash garbage
"The game is exceptional.
The thing i want to criticize is the execution.
I came back to the game during the lock-down and self-isolation. My save file is corrupt. Game loads when i press SPACE it boots me back to the main menu. ESC no longer lets me quit the game. So I sit trough 4 hour filechecking and nothing is detected to be wrong.
Starting a new campaign works.
Hope ETERNAL is better executed (pun intended)."
"Pros
- Good graphics and music
- Decent levels
- RPG-elements: choose some minor improvements to weapons and yourself

Cons
- No free saves; you died? Repeat the last 15mins for the 5th time!
- You die out of nowhere because once the scripted fights start you're surrouned by a hurricane of flesh and bullets and screams and some monsters one-hit you from afar
- Oh yeah, scripted fights. Enter room, doors close, enemies appear out of nowhere. Rince and repeat. Forever. Yaaaaaawn.
- ""Challenges"" require you to risk your life for some minor buffs or achievements; wouldnt be bad if you could SAVE YOUR GAME before getting started

The CONS are so severe and terrible that I'm stopping to play for the second time now and I dont think I will ever come back to finish this crap. Really sad."
"Optimization is the worst ever seen in a AAA game.
Always get 30-40% CPU usage and 40-60% GPU usage, causing heavy and frequent framedrops (30-40 FPS).

Using:
i7 8770K@4900MHz
Msi Seahawk RTX 2080
Both overclocked and stable in temperature"
"I had more fun playing Brutal Doom, this feels like quake arena + doom."
i wouldn´t recommend the game because of the bugs. every single time i die my screen will freeze for 15 minutes and then the game shut down. either that or i gotta shut down my computer cause i cant ac ces my home page.
"it's just not for me. I can't get into it. I've forced myself to play for 8 hours, and I'm gonna fuckin beat it, because I fuckin paid for it, but I just dont like it. It's not my thing."
TOO MUCH POLITICS!!!!!
this game is boring
The early game is some good fun but I really wish I dropped it about halfway through and never finished it.
"It started great, but I didn't like the mechanic of having to kill enemies from up close. Felt like there's only one way to play the game, and I didn't like it."
If you want to mindlessly kill things with minimal story then buy this game.
"I'm running Win 10. Every single time when I quit the game to desktop, the game crashes. every single time
it's 2020, please at least make it playable"
kil fdevil32
"if you like doing the same thing over and over, this is your game."
"I mean the graphics are sweet as they should be. But i'm just not impressed with the liner aspect of the game. I'm constantly dying because of jumping into invisible walls and falling to my death instead of just landing on a rock or platform. I see the demons jumping on all kinds of stuff. It's just not fun thinking you just kicked ass through a section of the game just to have 1 jump kill you because there was nothing in the way. Thus making you do the section again. All this game is teaching me is not to explore and run is a straight line down the giving path. unless the ultra liner aspect is changed is some way i cant recommend this game. Really the only reason i cant recommend the game. The enemies so far don't seem very intelligent, always shoot where you were so its easy to dodge most shoots if you stay moving. Just don't stop moving lol. If you like being shown the way and not exploring at all this is a good game still. Oh yeah the pistol is OP. haven't seen a point in using the shotgun tho just to clear with alt shot. I wish there was a neutral choice."
"IF YOU TRY TO EXPLORE THEIR LEVELS THEY CLOSE EVERYTHING OFF TO YOU MAKING YOU HAVE TO REPLAY THEIR GAME MULTIPLE TIMES JUST TO SEE THE LEVELS. NOT FUN GAMEPLAY, JUST A CHORE TO PLAY , AND YOU CANT EVEN EXPLORE. TERRIBLE. MADE BY IDIOTS."
"After defeated the last boss, I got a bug and could not finished him. He just lay on ground and rotate as I move and do nothing. I choosed restart mission and did not want to get throught whole level again and this just say, the game is not much fun for me. All game is just arenas with monster spawn, sometimes its super easy, sometimes its insane, unbalanced. Some monsters could survive massive amount of shots and this gives away the good feeling of slaugthering action, the killing animations get boring after a while. I would say this is a slightly below avarage FPS, but the last bug kills it for me."
"It's a boring game because its mindless, it's akin to a clicker with a metric ton of gore. Press melee when shiny the game."
Too much action and shooting and not enough mindless cutscenes and events.
"Great game, but honestly, you're better off on console. This game is a broken mess on PC. I have NO problems with other games, but everything from ID Software is a logistical nightmare to work with. If I go from my laptop screen to a TV or monitor plugged into it, it completely breaks the game and I have to delete the config file EVERY effing time I change what I'm playing on. And to this date, I cannot get the game to work on bluetooth headphones. Every other game and app works. Why not this one? Sorry that I can't give a proper review of the game itself. But every time I try to play it, I spend forever trying to get it to even work. Don't waste your time."
Eh

The game consistently gets stuck on 95% and never moves past the loading screen when I try to continue the game its incredibily frustrating and infuriating and I hate it.
too scary
"I don't know how but I got bored. It feels souless. Guns have no punch to them. Comparing to Rage 2 the shotgun in Rage 2 feels satisfying, you just want more enemies to shoot at. But in this game, you don't feel anything. I bought it for like 4 euros, so no big lose."
I'm sorry but you can't just do Mick Gordon dirty like that and get away with it especially Marty so until justice has been done this review will not change back to positive.
"""Let's bring it all back, proper""
""What, exactly?""
""The bad. Also, since original games were fairly good, let's come up with more bad of our own""
""Ok. What about the good?""
""No way.""

This is the dialogue that, judging from this game, went on in Bethesda's dev meeting. I'll give some points, why I think so:

* Entire game is basically arena after arena of respawning monsters and you can proceed ONLY if you've killed everything. Now, I really, really don't think this is good game design or anything enjoyable. Once you hear metal music pick up again, you know you're going to button mash for next 5 minutes. Ad nauseam. Every level has about 10-ish arenas with nothing of value inbetween. NO OLD DOOM GAME DID THIS, except for actual final boss fight. So forget about going your own way, Bethesda makes you kill every monster put into this game, period. Because it's so cool or something (it's not).

* Upgrade system that is unecessary and makes game feel rather limited and dumb. 20 shells for a shotgun, good luck! Again, original Doom games (1, 2, expansions) never tried to force a ""survival horror 2-bullets left"" thing on you. You ran out of ammo,  you could backtrack and pick up more, find secrets, and enemies dropped ammunition as well. Not here, except that...

* You're basically forced to use abysmal glory kill system or whatever sacrilege they did with chainsaw. Seeing those animations is cool for first few times, but force you to do those entire game to have any hope of proceeding, well, it's hard to cope with egoism put into this. Apparenly, ""our animations are so awesome that player will have no choice whether to use them, whatsoever, the main gameplay element is admiring how cool our animation artist was"". Christ.

* There is no exploration. Maps are horribly linear, have very little of alternate approaches, further hampered by terrible arena/locked door system and even secrets are usually at best, just nooks and crannies that open. Added to that, levels are farily boring, being basically sameish space station thingy and ""hell"" made of Disney dungeon assets that didn't make it into Skyrim.

* Enemies are bullet sponges, extremely quick, and have little feedback of either hurting you or getting hurt. So rather than being bloodthirsty space marine, you're circlestrafing while keeping one eye on health bar (because that's only way to know if it has depleted any, your character lacks any feedback) and other on horribly underpowered rocket launcher hitting nothing because even easiest enemies jump around like ninjas. Until ammunition runs out, because it sure will. For some reason, some weapons are supposed to be used sniper-like, aiming precisely from afar. That makes no sense whatsoever, because majority of enemies just charge your face.

Why play this game? With no sense of exploration or setting your own pace, non-enjoyable gunplay, horrible arena system and lackluster weaponry, what was point of this entire exercise? Yeah, it feels a bit like old games, but at no point ""as good as old games"". One should be really shooter-starved to consider playing Doom 2016."
boring
falling off shit you didnt realize was a cliff simulator
Very repetitive and overall boring. Not sure what people see in this game. It says glory kill. more like boring kill.
this game sucks shit too easy short as fuck final boss fight sucks full of shitty music and memes and doing 50 fatalities a second to get your health back from generic enemies that look like they belong in deep rock galactic overall F- rather play doom 2 and the new one will be the same shit fuck this game
"Good game, nice mechannichs. But is not my cup of tea. Very very focused in the intensity of the gameplay and the killing. And at some point you get bored. Also, I got lost many many times, the maps are confusing and annoying and make you circle back and stop agh, I just couldn't finish it"
"Although the game is fun, it is broken and at a certain mission I can't continue.  No more to say.  I am requesting a refund, hopefully they honor it due to the fact that I have supported steam, and refund requesting is not a normal thing I do.  In fact, this I believe is the first time I have requested a steam refund."
"I cannot recommend a game that suffers from unresolved technical issues like this. GTX 1060, 16 GB of RAM, Windows 10, everything up to date, the game stutters and freezes. The support is barely functional for this game.

Also Multiplayer doesn't work.

However, after getting a community kind-of-fix, I can say this is a great FPS. Really good package for SIngle-Player content.

If you see in a good sale, buy it. Otherwise, don't."
gets boring in half an hour. same 5 animations for plowing through enemies 1 by 1
"This game was great for the 12ish hours I have played it. But ever since a few months ago it will no longer start up and is completely unplayable. It constantly gets stuck while loading the title screen with the message: ""NOTICE Loading Title Storage"" and just stays like that with the menu music playing in the background.

Researched the issue and can barely find any more information other than this apparently happened to the bulk of players (on PC and console) around 2017 but was resolved. Everything I have tried to do to fix it (uninstall/reinstall, launch Steam in offline mode, delete game cache and settings, run commands, etc.) NOTHING has worked. This really pisses me off since I like the game so much and now I can't even play it."
"Everything about this game is amazing except while playing it, there were a lot of boring or obnoxious moments for me because of the design of the levels. The design of the levels require you to jump from platform to platform, very often in order to progress. And if you do not jump properly, you die and have to start from when the game last saved your progress. So in this game, you can't save when you want to save as well."
Broken Achievements
"I'll be really honest.  Although this is a well-made game it's just not quite my style and pace.  I loved things like Crysis and F.E.A.R. which are more tactical than this.  I like to sneak up on groups of enemies, scout their positions, learn their movements and then engage from a surprise attack, staying in control of the fight through position and tactical advantages.  DOOM is a frantic ""blast everything"" experience where enemy-spawning and placement of doorways means that enemies usually detect you before you detect them.

It's good but not really my thing.  I picked this game up at an absolute bargain-rate and I got very much what I expected.  But when it's cheaper than a cup of coffee ""why not give it a try"".

Update: I gave it another try recently, and got further with it but it's still just not my kind of game."
"To be fair to DOOM, it wasn't a game that looked like something I'd like. My favorite FPS is Unreal, and this looked like a FPS that lacked all the things that made Unreal such an amazing game. I only purchased DOOM because of the high ratings and recommendations, but it turned out exactly as bland as it looked. The arena-style combat just is not for me, and the environments are boring. The only cool thing is that you are this ultra badass, and roleplaying as him provided the only fun I had in my 5 hours of play."
"Feels too generic... Glad I picked this up on sale for super cheap. Plays fine, looks good, etc but nothing about it seems special in any way."
worst game i've ever played buggy glitchy mess i think i would rather kms than play this game for another second
"Save decided to corrupt 15 hours in, googled solutions and tried them all but couldn't recover. Other than corruption issue, it's reasonably fun but becomes repetitive pretty quickly."
if you want a fps shooter don't get this game if you want a platformer that seems so not work half the time and suck all the enjoyment out of it then this is a good choice
no
Level design.
"Very meh game, only 7 hours of gameplay while casually playing and 6 of those feel like the same thing over and over. Near the end i killed the final boss and didnt even realize since it felt just as repetative and boring as the other. If you can get it on sale for 5 bucks or free try it out."
Servers are dead. Didn't see that one coming..
"Not recommended,"
"overrated meme game, feels like someone looked at OG doom and thought to themselves, ""you know what made this game fun? well let's remove all of it, slow it the fuck down and add melee executions, because THAT is what doom is all about."""
"First off:  I played DOOM 1 and 2, I played Duke Nukem 3D, I played the Quake games.  I play a lot of games, and I've been playing them for about three decades.  I still play about a dozen hours of multiplayer shooters every week, in my 30's.  I remember the old games, I remember having fun with them.

If you take off the nostalgia goggles?  This one kinda sucks.  It's well polished, for what it is, but underneath, it's empty.  It's not the worst game I've ever played, but I'm VERY glad I only paid $6 for this mess, and skipped it when it was a new release.

TL;DR:  It feels like a high-res version of an old-ass game.  We've learned a lot about game design in 20+ years, but not here.

People talk about fluid combat, RIP AND TEAR, etc.  What they don't talk about, is that for every 30 seconds of ""intense"" combat (pick any gun and click for a few seconds while strafing) there's 5 minutes of wandering around, backtracking through each level, checking the awkward in-game map every now and then to look for ""secrets"" or even just to find your way to the next objective.  There's no ""cutscenes,"" but there's tons of forced stopping points to sit and listen to someone talk, or perform arbitrary actions (see, this one door doesn't open when you approach it, you have to press E, how exciting), despite Doom Guy's apparent attitude of ""FUCK YOU I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME.""  As a grown-ass man, a lot of the player character's behavior feels like watching a hormonal preteen throwing a temper tantrum, and it's more silly than ""bad ass.""

I don't know.  I could write more about all the specific failings, and go into more depth, but I guess I don't care enough.  DOOM 2016 is mostly just a very Generic shooter with a handful of fun-ish mechanics, crippled by indecisiveness on whether or not it should focus on action or puzzles, like some kind of awkward FPS-Metroidvania.  Wolfendoomtroidvania?  Who knows.

I think, also, I might just be too old for the BLOOD GUTS DEAD GUYS SAYTANIC RITUALS FIRE SKULLS aesthetics here.  I feel like the intended audience might be dudes who wear trenchcoats, collect katanas, think naruto-running looks cool, and probably need therapy.

You want a flowy shooter with great movement, tons of enemies, deep customization, and gameplay that's all-around actually interesting?  Go play Warframe.  You'll get so much more out of it, for free.  
You want something hard?  Play something competitive, like Siege.  If you got hard at my mention of trench coats and katanas and really wanna lean into that?  Go play... Postal 2?"
no
"It's a good game but we're back in 2004 with checkpoint saving and BAD CHECKPOINTS. Congratulations iD Software, it's a blast to the past with having to replay entire sections because somehow you're unable to add a quicksave and quickload to your game. Literal W.T.F."
Doom is a shooter that seems to take a lot of nods from a game with the same name released in 1993. I Guess that's okay but I'm not into the idea that it's a ripoff.
"I'm sure it's a great game, but the absolutely horrendous mouse lag I experience kind of ruins it for me."
"UPDATED my computer to play Modern Warfare (which runs great brw) and DOOM still runs at 13 FPS. WHAT A JOKE! Best optimized game of all time, 10/10. 

Brutal Doom is still WAY better. 

--Original Post--

Game just does not run on my computer at a decent frame rate for me. It should. Does sometimes. But over all it doesn't. Have tried everything. Here's what I've gathered so far. Its a good game but the hype is WAY overblown for me personally. Weapon upgrades, Doomtalities and level design are all just meh to me. The world is very nondescript and orange, and suffers from what Oblivion suffered from where ... its basically just bunch of rocks and spikes. I'm sure there are other facility levels later on but so far every area feels like a Canyon based deathmatch arena / jungle gym and its just not doing it for me. Where are the psuedo facilities that made Doom awesome? Doom to me is a game where you play a Badass out of luck, with no where to run, charging straight into hell because you'll probably die and there are no other options. You have little to no identity. In this game you're a creature who has already dominated his environment. You're there because you're supposed to be because you're the Doom guy and you're in Doom. An already established cliche inside his own environment. I'm not saying Doom ever had a great story line but it just feels weird and almost Duke Nukemish. Something about making things more and more .... high fidelity just takes it more and more away from the surreal comic book style vibe that made it what it was in the first place. Put the original wall and floor tiles up against the look and feel of this game and the original is way better. Far more creative. After Diablo, Event Horizon and God of War the hellish world we get here seems bland to me and I can't shake it. 

Is the game good? Yes. Will you love it? Probably. Should you listen to me? Absolutely not. Its just to me the overall style is once again being missed. I want a fast passed corridor shooter where I battle zombies and demons in biomech facilities and this game doesn't seem to provide that. Instead I just keep getting Oblivion style death match arenas. Far closer in style to Unreal Tournament or Quake 3 Arena with npcs than Doom. I think if Brutal Doom didn't exist and if people weren't constantly make mods and maps ect for it, maybe if I had been Doom starved for decades, maybe if I really liked the direction Quake took with deathmatch maybe I would like this game. To be clear it is a good game and people would probably like it even if it wasn't Doom by title. Hell tbh I like it and if it ran at decent frame rate I'd at least play it through once. Will I play it more than 10 times through and find myself downloading community maps and mods for it almost 30 years later? No, not even close. But hey, its the best, closest thing you're ever going to get. Yay Doom."
too many aimboters
"Shadow of a previous era, now a console delight, for all family to enjoy."
Maps are poorly finished.. most of my deaths are from being trapped against a wall or falling through the ground. game will also occasionally glitch and all weapons will stop working. I cannot recommend this game.
Questmarker.
ton of hackers one hacker in every game pass beginer piz fix
"the game is great. but it just freeze randomly. it took me me several hour to figure it out. just switch to vulkan and install vulkan driver. suck
why not you checking the program before the game was released?
win10 i5 9400 rtx2060"
"Wow. Why did I wait so long to play this? Very entertaining. Super quick run and gun style FPS. Very reminiscent of the original Doom like impossible difficulties and bad-ass demons, with what you would expect from a modern take; armor and weapon upgrade choices, good 3D map, fun melee kills. This is not the jumpscare garbage that was Doom3. This is true to Doom and Doom2 game style.

Edit: Changing my review. The non-skippable intro screen is supremely annoying when you have only a small window available to get a game in. The wait times for multiplayer are bullshit. You do not need to mapvote, and you certainly do not need a full minute to do so, then a 30 second buffer, then another 30 second character/weapon select, then ANOTHER 10 second ready once in the game. WHAT THE HELL? This isn't a damned battle royale, just get on with the deathmatch! Once a multiplayer game is over you can't actually LEAVE THE GAME until you watch the whole ""you win"" or ""you lose"" crap, and the top three players. SO MUCH WAITING for what is supposed to be a fast paced shooter game. Stop with this garbage. The auto-join sucks. Wish there was a pick your lobby like in the old Quake and Doom days. Let my escape key do it's job. Waiting in multiplayer is the worst and the intro screen sucks. End rant."
"Total garbage. The entire game is this stupid ""mechanic"" where you are on the verge of death, even at 100% health, and you have to melee enemies to get health back. The little health you have is gone instantly when enemies hit you, and you are being hit from enemies that spawn all around you. Try to aim and you die instantly. You circle strafe, left clicking and mash 'f"" (I think it was 'f'). Over and over and over. That is the game. Oh and get lost in the maze that the space marines decided it would be a good idea to build their base as.  You can carry barely any ammo, so you run out and have to pick up ammo boxes constantly.  Sweet 2008 graphics. Insane mouse acceleration. This ""game"" sucks."
"a mediocre shooter in general, a terrible episode in the doom series. shotgun is decent, though."
Have you READ the end user licence agreement?
servers shut down days after the sale. TRASH
"Campaign is decent but not very long approx 18 hours on nightmare
Multiplayer is fun but i cannot connect to the game anymore for some damn reason."
"Cant recommend since Bethesda just removed all their titles from GForce NOW, as a result people who payed their money for the game can't play it anymore."
walk to an arena. fight. walk to another arena. fight. gets old fast.
"Pulled out of Nvidia GeForce now service, lost access to all Bethesda products I bought exclusively to play on GeForce now since I don't own a gaming PC. Don't trust this company to protect it's customer over making that extra little bit of money. Thanks zenimax."
"Not really sure what makes this game overwhelmingly positive. Extremely boring FPS. Picked it up for $5.99 wouldn't say its worth much more.

Also, beat the game on normal in 12 hours. It's extremely short. I cant imagine paying retail price for something less than 20...the replay isn't that high either unless you like hard mode or finding collectibles."
"Save games always got corrupted, preventing a reload & forcing a restart.  Every. Single. Time.  Game also locked up/crashed a few times.  Basically it is unplayable."
"Cannot recommend this game despite the clearly positive reception, as the game will not start. Upon launch I am treated to a screen that says ""Notice: Loading Title Storage"" which is followed by an immediate crash or the game freezing entirely. I have yet to see the main menu, and no amount of googling has given me any information as to how to fix the problem."
"too much like an arcade game, and not enough strategy to be interesting."
"This was a big letdown for me. The graphics are great, but the pickups have a singularly console game type feel which breaks the immersion. It's a mindless shooter which should suit anyone who likes to just run and gun. I personally prefer the Fallout 4 types of RPG shooters which take a lot of thinking, broad tactics and management of inventory, with a rich levelling up system. I played about 3 levels of Doom and cannot see myself going back to it."
"No longer on Geforce Now, Bethesda is greedy for our money"
"Thing won't even load. Be a black screen for 15 seconds then crash. Even if you have a better graphics card than they specify, it still might crash. A lot of tutorials that allegedly fix the bug don't seem to be ""AMD friendly"". So if you have an AMD graphics card, please be careful when purchasing."
"Loved Doom ... until it didn't work.  10 hours after playing it   
 Stuck so I Googled solution after solution to no avail.  After all it was fun when it worked.   Maybe if I can get it working again I'll think about buying Doom Eternal.    But Bethesda is known in the community for having broken games and issues. So maybe not"
foundry level
Can’t turn up the brightness so I couldn’t see
"Devmode bug is still around. 2 chapters left and my save file is corrupt. 

There are workarounds but I'm not going to spend hours trying to find the solution. This bug has been around for a while and has received no inclination that it will be fixed.

Bethesda has turn into a dogshit company, fuck you bethesda."
Doom is supposed to be scary dark and creepy. This one is just ... dull!
"As like many others that I have read comments about.   The load times are terrible or it hangs and you have to completely restart the game...   It isn't my computer, checked all that."
"I have to be honest: it's not a bad game, I had fun playing it, but it's absolutely not a good DOOM game. If it had another name I'd have sure recommended it, but the name is carrying has a very big responsibility. This game basically become a meme of itself, the focus seems to be on exaggerate everything (the glory kills for example).
Let's start from the beginning: the first two DOOM games were masterpieces, they changed gaming forever. Now, I know the times are changing and mechanics and all have to evolve, but the original DOOM games are like a cool guy, this game is like a poser guy who tries to dress the same way and says ""hey look at me, I'm cool too!"".
Now the serious, technical part: the game is basically structured in ""rooms"", where you're locked in with all the monsters and the doors opens when you killed everyone. It was so much better in the original games where you have a level structure. 
The part that everyone seems to love, the glory kills, is just boring. After the first 50 demons you slay, it's not funny anymore to see a scripted animation of a demon face exploding, it just interrupts the pace of the game, that is already slow for an old style fps.
The game is pretty easy, I played it on ultra-violence and finished it without efforts. 
The multiplayer is very bad. It's very different from the single player, made by another company, and it's like a mix of halo and cod, where you're slow and can carry 2 weapons a time."
"It's a platformer, but in 3d, and with very limited ammunition (3 magazines for the machinegun). You will -literally- need to scavenge for every magazine, everytime you fight.

Don't be fooled, it's bad. Stupidly bad."
"Apparently, Bethesda did not learn its lesson what happens when it tries to copy EA's path. They removed all their games from Geforce Now. This ridiculous. I paid for this game and I should be able to play any where I want. I will not buy any other Bethesda title unless they treat us fair again.
BRING THIS GAME TO GEFORCE NOW BACK!"
Boring game
YUCK! :P
"I played the game because I like action, horror, guns and gore stuff. The game satisfied me with my expectations, but there was a big problem for me. I didn't know where to go most of the time. And it's so frustrating after a time."
"2020, thought to give Doom a try.
Just as a heads-up: I've played the original Doom games when they first launched. Yeah, the very old ones (Duke Nukem, Heretic, Hexen, Wolfenstein, etc). 

Positive thingies:

- Runs well on an i7-8700K with a RTX 2080Ti.

Negative thingies:
- The game does not recognize a standard 21:9 resolution (3440x1440) when starting the game. You'll get a peasantry resolution which you have to change. Strangely, the main menu doesn't have a straight up [Settings] button. You have to click on Campaign, select a save slot and afterwards you'll get to Settings. I find this amateurism.

- Motion sickness. Yeah, you heard that right. Though I played hundreds of FPS during my 25-years gaming experience, the movement of this game causes nausea. And I am used to fast paced FPS. As a comparison, I loved playing Quake 2 and Unreal Tournament.

Raising the FOV and disabling motion blur does not help. The overall pace of movement and animations are just chaotic.

- I despise the yellowish color palette. Makes everything look so dull. Reshade is recommended for those who share my thought.

- Weapons are underwhelming: Haven't played much, but the pistol and shotgun are so weak, while the melee attack is OP. This game should be a gun feast, but it is just so boring to have pea shooters. Why should I bother with guns, when I can just spam my melee attack and get the job done fast? Add to that the fact that you constantly run out of ammo. 

- There isn't any spatial sound. You'll hear a foe who grunts above or below you, to your left or right. You turn and there's no one. Few seconds you realize that the foe is above or below you. Sound immersion 0.

If you consider any of the above negative thoughts to be a downer for you, then hey, you're in the same boat with me and I don't recommend buying Doom.
If you can live with them, then by all means, buy the game."
"Unfortunately we are seeing the downsides to DRM like steam this week. I own this game on steam, but if I login to steam using a GeForce Now server I cannot play this game that I own. Bethesda and other publishers are asking steam to prevent this and they are obliging."
"EDITED 07.31.22

After many, many hours of playing Doom Eternal I have amended some of the gripes I had with 2016, while others have become even more aggravated.
1. Unbalanced difficulty - Nightmare suffers most from this, in particular. Some of the Heavy demons get trivial while the Imps are as imposing as bosses due to their aimbot.
2. Snapmap is extremely limited and doesn't hold a candle even to the early OG Doom level editors. But at least it's something, rather than the big bowl of nothing we have in Eternal.
3. Zero replayability, if you're not interested in an Ultra-Nightmare run. Eternal makes an attempt to mitigate this with Master Levels and Horde Mode.
4. Mediocre multiplayer. And it's dead, too!
5. The garbage constant red/brown color scheme of the campaign that constantly make some enemies camouflage themselves. The later Multuplayer maps are much more vibrant and colorful. Thankfully, Eternal goes full force with colors.
6. If you're a completionist, the sheer amount of Points of No Return in campaign levels that cause you to restart the entire level when you miss a secret WILL make your blood boil. I am SO thankful that Eternal gets fast travel points when you're about to complete a level!

Overall, it's fine for a single playthrough (not counting Ultra-Nightmare) and mucking around with friends on Snapmap, but not for much else."
"Good game. However, Bethesda's move to remove it from Nvidia's GeForce Now is a stellar example of corporate greed and betrayal of customers. Bethesda shouldn't have the right to tell me on which and whose hardware I play the game that I legally purchased and paid for."
"Game starts on 2nd Screen and stays Black, are we in 2006?
Now i need to find a fix for this sh..."
"Enemies are bullet sponges and multiplayer is boring

I seriously don't understand the appeal of this game... just walk around and punch things while good music plays for 10% of your playtime? How immersive"
"Overrated as fuck. Combat is boring and simplistic and that's like 90% of the game. Audio is also bad, its very noticeable if you turn off the music, its like there is absolutely zero echo/reverb and zero dynamics. If the game costed a fraction of what it does, I might recommend it, but I think it's absolutely not worth paying that much money for a game like this."
"It didn't take long for me to figure out that this game wasn't for me. It's not a knock on the game though, at least not wholly. The way this game handles movement is very disorienting for me, and everything from running to camera movement is actually *too* smooth for my eyes to deal with, which is a sentence I never thought I'd have to write. Fact is, the game for some reason just makes me dizzy as heck, to the point of actually feeling sick if I play it for more than an hour at a time. I'm an edge case and I don't hide that, but if it happens for me, it may well happen for someone else so I figured I'd at least put this in writing for those select few people.

This is a great game that is a genuine throwback to the best of 90's shooters, but if you're prone to motion sickness or dizziness, consider yourself duly warned."
"Bought it because of GeForce Now.

Failthesda withdrew from Geforce now."
"I bought this game for use with geforce now. After almost two weeks, Bethesda withdraws her from the service. Kick in the balls for the fan"
"Liked it at first. Now that I bought it myself and revisited it. I hate it.
it is boring and repetitive.

the checkpoint saving system is something wrong. If you consider that you have to scavenge a lot for ammo and armor. It happened to me that I missed a few jumps and instantly died. SO I had to run a lot to get the armor and ammo from different places and the try the jumps again.

And why does the player have no legs? Is this still a thing?"
"Very repetitive, I turn it on for some mindless fun but always end up closing it after just 2 hours or so. It's pretty much the same thing over and over in different locations. Not a bad game but nothing to keep me hooked. Soundtrack is great though."
"Doom has a great gameplay, it's fun to play and it's definitely worth getting acquainted with, perhaps, purchasing through some ultimate sale, or by not purchasing at all. Then why do I say ""I do  not recommend it""? 
Well, because as an AAA project with full price (on launch), this glitchswamp abandonware has no right to exist. Bugged achievements, 4k crashing my monitor, infuriating UI decisions, which require you to enter startup arguments to fix some of them, and others are just bad code. Totally f****d up physics sometimes throwing you in the nearest wall, and OMG that collision of rocket launcher's projectiles. Levels designed without clear articulation of the allowed and not allowed places. That all happened to me. Now read all the forums with hundreds of pages complaining on this game. Oh and the ending is so predictable and so disappointing.
Summary: did I enjoy smashing demons? Yes, very much. Did I enjoy the GAME? Not so much."
"Bought this game and several others because I could play on Geforce Now as I have no gaming PC or current gen console. Now I can't play it because the publisher is greedy and pulled their games from the service. Obviously won't be buying their games anymore as I couldn't play them if I wanted to. Good job alienating a group of paying customers. What difference does it make how I play the game so long as I buy it? It's not like the publisher makes money from me buying expensive computer hardware to play the game, they definitely won't get my money if I don't buy the game simply because I don't have the resources to play it.

In short, I bought the games purely because I have Geforce Now, without Geforce Now I won't be buying more since I can't play games without it."
"Pulled from Geforce NOW, not good at all"
"The game is great. But, since I paid for the game, and it's tied to my steam account, I should be able to install it and play from any of my PCs, even via the cloud. The fact that I can't play through GEForce Now, or buy a copy as a gift for someone with a non-gaming PC to play on GEForceNow, is B********it. Fix this Bethesda!"
Too many demons for my liking
"So I've literally bought Doom, Dishonored 2 and Wolfenstein: Shadow of the Colossus to play them for the first time on Geforce Now. Created a Steam Account for this. And now practically I need to play those games on my PC, which I hate and actually can't. I will never get to play them, literally they have 2 minutes of playtime each.
As I'm not even able to see the menu right now, this games deserves -10 stars."
"Doom: Battle Arena.  Rinse and repeat: open door, fight enemies, unlock door and continue.  There was many fold more creativity and care gone into the older versions.  Even Doom 3, which had a somewhat similar rinse and repeat felt far more thought out.

Played Doom primarily on a friend's computer and was let down, but decided to try it again on a free weekend and was reminded of why it feels just so dry and bland.  Throwing in gore does not cover up the lack of design or care.  Don't be strategic with your actions and combat, no, just run in.  This version of Doom has become exactly what every other first person shooter has become, a bland repaving of 'put in more action'."
"Good game. One of the best modern day first person shooters, and it's destined to be a classic. I can't give the game a positive review though, since for some reason on my computer it crashes every 20 minutes."
game doesnt even fgcking launck gaddam
"The audio in the game is a cacophony of gargling, screaming, and gunshots. I play with headphones and honestly I can barely tell whats going on half the time. It just makes me feel anxious and uncomfortable. The gameplay is fun but I cant get past that horribly disorienting feature. I cant even enjoy the voice acting while in a fight since I cant hear them over the sounds of demons coming from every angle. Its incredibly disappointing to have everyone I know tell me to get this game for me to hate playing it. 

I'm sure if you have a better audio setup or something the game is a lot more fun but for me its not worth the money."
"I'd been looking forward to playing this game for quite a while as my old graphics card didn't run it very well at all.
Having upgraded my PC this was one of the first games I tried and I've been left underwhelmed.
The environments are interesting but are let down by poor quality textures which just look out of place.
The game play is very arcadey and seems to be based around clearing an area and moving on giving little bursts of action and no sense of discovery or exploration.
Despite the games age several technical issues persist including an annoying issue with the game overriding Windows and choosing it's own audio device.

If I hadn't owned the game for so long without being able to play I'd be requesting a refund."
"ID and Valve blow balls. Went to restart a level to get to a hidden item and the game reset ALL of my gameplay for the day. I lost 8 hours of playing time, achievements, runes, etc.

Googling I find out this has been an issue for YEARS and is still not resolved.

Well....there goes a sale ID and Valve because I WILL NOT buy the new version. No excuse for these bugs to last this long."
"It's basically a glorified arena shooter. I've played doom 1, 2, 3, 64.... This DOES NOT capture what originally made doom great. Graphics are always nice, but it means nothing to a lot of us if you completely change the gameplay in what essentially feels like a round of quake or invasion- over and over and over and over. 

If it isn't broke don't fix it... the older dooms had levels and enemy placement that felt good. This just feels lazy. Hop into this room, lockdown and kill all the monsters. Rinse and repeat. I'm not looking forward to the next one if this is the 'new' formula I.D. is going for. It is a shame too, because we can imagine what doom would be like if we stuck to the original idea.

Everything except for the gameplay looks and sounds great, but the gameplay is just hyperactive twitch shooting in an arena for the most part. Very disappointing. I had to force myself to finish this after starting it up multiple times just so I would get this out of my backlog. 

You can polish a turd until it shines beatifully, but in the end, its still a turd.... A shiny, beatiful turd of what doom used to be"
ok doomer
"Garbage.. Just another crappy arcade shooter, but with the name doom on it."
"Bought it, played it for an hour, and spent most of my time searching where to go cause all the places look exactly the same.
Boring in my opinion."
It's not for me. I'll try to finish it but this is the last Doom game I'll play.
"The multiplayer has and always will be garbage. All of the cry babies who complained of hackers ad nauseam in 2016 and 2017 are the only fools STILL playing a game that was never popular. And guess what -- they are all running hacks. It's pathetic, embarrassing, and a shame the platform fails to do anything except lean back and count bills while people spend hard earned cash on games that are never level playing fields from launch. F you Steam, and F you iD/Bethesda. I'll never drop a dime on your products again. 

Oh and the campaign is legit."
"@10 hours play time....An OK game. fast paced, lots of weapons and monsters/demons. beautiful level design.


EDIT:
@16+ hours play time..., game has become very repetitive. so much so that I have become bored to the point of not caring if I finish it or not.


Edit2:
At 21 hours I uninstalled. it's just the same thing over and over, and over, and over."
Stop advertising games in games !
corrupt save file make me lose all my progress. Great job Bethesda
"I have 4 hours on the game, 3 hours of it i spend looking for hidden stuff and secrets in case i missed an upgrade.

Judge this as you will."
"Very boring,
after twenty minutes of play,
I was annoyed,
and I stopped.

Always the same game‑mechanic,
since 23 years.

I didn’t find it fun.

I played with Wolfenstein شيطان and Doom in 1994.
I had 14 year,
now I think : « big mistake and huge waste of time »."
"Tried starting this game a couple times and its just shoot punch, shoot punch, move fast, shoot punch. Most boring game I've ever played aside from Warframe."
"The Game is very overrated I finished it in 8h and was pretty dissapointed with the story mode, the first 2-3h are very good, you get new weapons you fight new enemys and the game makes you feel like a complete Badass but it gets old very fast, the boss fights are pretty boring especially the last one, the levels are all the same (except for the tower one and the Vega one those ones were very very good), Hell just doesnt feel like hell at all, Im very dissapointed with Doom I also want to say that i took my time with the game, I didnt rush it i tried to explore everything that i could and still finished the game in 8h, as for the multiplayer mode its basically Quake (but i have to say that the Snapmap feature is pretty cool). So yea i dont recommend this game at all."
"I just couldn't get into this.  It was a slog to log even 90 minutes.  At each mission complete screen, I'd invariably save and quit because I just wanted to do anything else.  Perhaps worse, this was one of the rare games where I had zero desire to go off the beaten trail hunting secrets and super tough boy points or whatever they're called - I just rushed as quickly as I could to the end.  At each summary screen, the game would tell me how bad of an explorer I was, and I was fine with it.

I found the combat tedious, particularly the glory kill mechanic, which is cool for maybe the first 5 chumps whose jaws you punch through their rib cages.  The vertical movement was clunky and irritating, which hurt the fast paced style they advertised.  Most of the encounters were uninspired, and I found the level design to be either boring or confusing.  Also, in a game supposedly all about high octane slaughter, most enemies spent all their time running away from me.  Not even getting the absurdly gas-guzzling chainsaw could salvage things for me.

The tone is likewise uninspired.  Between the glory kills, the silly metal soundtrack, and the few ""story"" moments where your guy just gets angry and smashes computers and elevator buttons, it all felt really ham-fisted.  It's like the whole game was developed after someone dug up my old middle school trapper-keeper and found a doodle of punch-gun man, who has shotgun knees and wears an awesome trench coat.  Which, that would be fine if the game was built around that kind of goofy tone.  But the environment here just doesn't support that.

Speaking of (and to say something nice), the environments themselves were beautifully rendered.  The explosions from grenades or the barrels haphazardly left all over the place were very satisfying.  The game ran wonderfully, and the guns I did unlock were enjoyable to use.

Maybe if I'd played the original Doom games, this would have grabbed more of me, but I kind of doubt it.  Nostalgia can only go so far.  The only one I've ever really played was Doom 3, which was apparently an outlier.

If the idea of killing a bunch of losers as a, frankly, juvenile vision of badassdom sounds tiring, I'd avoid this."
"It's very fun combat, but quite easy and even on high difficulty battles tend to end quick. After this is annoying jump and run... and more annoying - rune challenges.

If you like arcade Doom - you will have fun
For me is a big annoyance. 

P.S: I'm coming back for the combat, tho"
Froze at loading screen after start up. Refunded.
"Was a good a game, now so painfully riddled with cheaters I really hope you save your money..."
Low ammo count violence orgy. Personally didn't enjoy it much.
"Nothing like forced masochism. Griefy checkpoint system, active anti mod, active anti save share, awful level design, no cheats. In short absolutely no way to appreciate the game as a piece of art or play it in any way divergent from COD. 

Seriously need to take a minute to expound a bit, this level design is terrible. Clearly the goal was to make it Q3 style arena shooter, nothing like a defensible position anywhere, That means no hallways, no staircases, no balconies. These things exist but there's always a breaking aspect. And if there isn't expect enemies to flat out teleport up your ass.

And yet they want it to hopefully pass as an actual human built facility. It doesn't without serious disregard or oblivity. The result in any case is schizophrenic architecture that would give Lovecraft's outer horrors a headache that despite that lacks any hint of freedom. The entire thing is composed of invisible walls in the form of shit you can't break or climb over or through resulting in a monorail experience. Doubly ironic considering all the literal holes in the engine speed runners found. 

I suppose that makes sense, Lovecraftian architecture, holes in reality. QED.

Also the platforming.... Just wow. Every possible fail was crammed in to this level design.

Insecure tryhard epeen mentality taking a warm dump on Doom's legacy of freedom and enjoyment on the player's terms. No cheats. No mods. IN A DOOM REBOOT. It's like rebooting mario cart and not having power ups. The greed is real.

Doom 2016 is an absolute chore shooter and you WILL play it as the devs prefer, or not at all.

Good thing I only spent 6$. 

Seriously what is wrong with people? Who enjoys being completely stripped of all agency and being given pointless tasks purpose built to be annoying? Everyone but me apparently.

Edit: Updates on 2020-02-18 1121 AM and I found a cheat mod that makes it remotely playable as a casual artistic experience, as opposed to the epeen ""I'm such a baydayss dude check out mah flames!"" trash lamented above. (Literal flames in doom eternal FWIW. This entire review applies there also minus the even trying for realism bit.)"
"It's just not fun. This is the second time I've tried to play this game in the last few years and already I want to uninstall it and move on since it is once again not even mildly amusing. There are numerous annoyances that are not easily dismissed such as splash screens, a map that doesn't remember preferences and voices that keep repeating the same useless message over and over again.

The action moves too fast compared to other earlier FPS titles which means that reactions are too twitch based and do not allow for sufficient strategy development which in turn makes all the weapon mods difficult to learn and appreciate."
"I've been a fan of Doom ever since the first version came out on DOS, and spent a lot of fun hours playing solo and with friends and creating custom maps etc. As such i was quite thrilled to see the reimagining with modern graphics and techniques, and I was going to give it a solid recommendation after seeing the result and getting some basic gameplay in, finding the challenge interesting with pretty smart AI ranged aiming etc. (although once you figure out how it ""thinks"" it becomes less of a challenge).

That is, until it became painfully clear what the game mode of this game is; no matter what environment you are in (which are nicely crafted!) the basic gameplay is this:
1. Enter room
2. Room closes, locking you in
3. You kill x enemies in the room
4. Room opens up and you continue down the otherwise completely linear map
5. Rinse and repeat

Each room being relatively small, arena-style areas where the enemies get game-cheating advantages to provide ""challenge"" (in quotes).
The bosses are just bullet sponges to make them tough, but really, making them very bland endurance fights is pretty lame.

So, overall verdict: it's pretty, well made in terms of visual appeal (if you don't get tired of the repetitive nature of animations), but the actual gameplay just absolutely kills this as a negative. Sorry folks, nice try but I can't honestly recommend it after a number of hours of play."
"Don't think I have ever disliked such a technically competent, visually pleasing and nicely scored game, but after the moderate fun of the first few levels, it felt like a chore and I had to force myself to finish the last few levels to reclaim my SSD space. I like the engine, Vulkan API feels like the future and the models of monsters and weapons are good if somewhat generic. The levels are also visually nice, though I liked Mars much more than hell. I just hate the gameplay choices. Seeing the same finishing animations and locking the player into rooms with a dozen monsters at a time are tropes that get old really fast and bigger monsters are bullet sponges that feel like cardboard you occasionally clip through with no physics. I basically hateplayed it to the end to be free of it."
"black screen on startup still an issue after 6 years very good stuff id, fix ur game b4 churning out more shit for ms"
Would it kill them to make a good game?
doesnt boot
"Triple AAA game. 
Multi-million project from a huge game company. 
I only get a black screen."
its a fucking headache but fun
"Нorrible optimization, does not start on nvidia 780 graphics card"
"Doom is one hell of a game. One of the best FPS campaigns, If I could've finished the fucking game. Halfway into the game, and I glitched through a wall that caused me to skip a few checkpoints. Didn't have the right item to progress in that area and had to restart the game. Game save got corrupted. Bethesda, please fix the game breaking bugs on a fucking 4 year old game. Other than that, 8/10 IGN Makes you feel like one badass mofo."
Rip and try to hold back tears
"Game worked for about 2 hours then never worked again.  Blue and black screens of death constantly.  Developers are posting garbage fixes like command line statements and installing framework or C++ specific versions that don't work.  I've had temporary fixes using everything from nvidiaInspector hacks, disabling SLI, to reinstalling the game and graphic drivers.  None work permanently.  Broken mess.  I've literally spent twice the time attempting to fix the game than I've played it.  I'm uninstalling and reinstalling my bootleg version from launch time that I know actually works.  I'll be damned if I want to pay full price for the sequel if they can't even get this right."
This game does not run in Linux any more. I want my money back.
so far no news. purchased last night and still can't get it to start........
Amazing that I install after over a year of playing and old bugs still haven't been fixed.
"A disgusting shooter with a stupid rethinking of the plot, with constant finishing off opponents for the sake of bullets.
Frankly weak multiplayer."
"The Good so far (3 hours, 4 weapons found):
- Graphics
- Level design not linear
- Soundtrack
- Adrenalinic during battles

The Bad:
- fucking checkpoints... on high difficulty if you die you must kill over and over again the same fucking daemons (or recover same fucking armor, or walk along the same path, or do again the same fucking thing that you didn't do when the game decided to save your progress) losing time uselessly until you reach new checkpoint.If I were masochist and i liked to fight same battles or see same places endlessly i would play Prepare to die, not Doom. It's almost game breaking for me.

- doom 2 with sprint speed and a fucking double barrel shotgun was much much better, more adrenalinic, more frenetic, more satisfying.

-Disappointing physic of bullets impact, enemies sometime seem to be like a sort of bullet sponges with almost no reaction to hits.. and shotgun seems to fire blanks even on close combat.

-even if he runs, doomguy is slooooow, firepower so far has been replaced by ""fatalities"" but meh.. i want point-blank instakill shots back... 

-Again, when i use my shotgun a few inches from an imp, the poor creature should EXPLODE and the corpse should be thrown back in a blaze of blood, not just almost ignore the hit or sway like a drunk waiting for fatality, for god sake!  

So...
At the moment i can recommend doom only if you aren't a fan of old doom games ....and if you endure checkpoints and fatalities."
"I love the soundtrack music to this game, which is great because the game itself has ABSOLUTELY NO SOUND.
Nothing during gameplay at all, pure silence.
I can hear the proud swish of IDSoftware on startup and a low hum during loading screens but that's it.

Mick Gordon is the only reason I haven't refunded yet.  I'll go listen to him and play a game with sound instead."
"The game wouldn't load but I managed to fix it after a while of looking up fixes, but everytime I tried start arcade, singleplayer or anything like that it just freezes, After Looking up fixes and nothing working I had to unfortunately refund it, Shame."
"Platforming, weapon upgrades and repetitive gameplay. In a nutshell you just enter from arena to arena and fight your way towards the end. It's boring as hell. No real feeling of progress. Just same looking corridors and research facilities over and over again. And the guns. Only the BFG9000 felt powerful and satisfying to use.
Pinky demon takes 6 rocket launcher hits??! Cacodemon takes 5?! What is this shit? Not anything I'd expect from a Doom game. I so much wanted to like this, but let's be honest here. This is not very appealing as a Doom game nor generic FPS. In every way it's uninspiring, mediocre, repetitive, generic arena shooter with no real feeling of progress.
It does run well thou and I only encountered one glitch during my 2 playthroughs and it was not game breaking. So, if you're in to arena fights in same looking enviroments it's just the game for you."
"The review for true doom fans.

There's no middle thumb so... Doom 2016 is basically just a generic FPS that was over-hyped something fierce.  For an aging gamer like myself, Doom 2016 was nothing special on release and the fact they had screwed up the multiplayer and had no level editing what-so-ever in the traditional id software sense was maddening by itself.  But since Zenimax bought out id software and John carmack one of the last original founders of id left id hasn't been the same since and you can feel it in the direction of the game.

In the 90's back when the original doom's were released.  Doom ushered in game modding on the PC and to have a game that gave birth to modding not have the open ness of the tools the devs used to build the game with is maddening.  Part of the reason modern AAA gaming sucks is the removal of tools from the end users and community.   Which left the doom mod community in a lurch when we knew we were getting the garbage snap ""editor"" in which pre-fabbed rooms can be stitched together in simple ways but bars the complex level editing of the original dooms.

In comparison to Doom 3, Doom 3 had a better feeling world and atmosphere than Doom 2K16 even if Doom 2016 is better looking and has faster combat, there's something artificial about doom 2k16 that is offputting, especially in the later levels that really drag as you move from locked room to locked room to clear the waves for the doors to open.  A feature that becomes super annoying if you replay the game to try to clear all the secrets.

On the whole the game design is uninspired and you'd best off looking into the original doom/doom 2 and getting the fan made updates with brutal doom and checking out fan made levels if you're looking for new and interesting gameplay.  Doom 2K16 is everything right and wrong about game design, the game is too focus group tested to bring anything new to the table because the people at id were fearful about alienating 'modern gamers'.

There's also something floaty and gimmicky about the glory kills that get really old, really fast, thereby defeating their purpose.  Many of the glory kills and how you perform them is not obvious, why is that a problem?  When upgrading runes or doing challenges they want you to do certain glory kills in order to get the upgrade/do the challenge.  Knowing you have to specifically look at certain body parts while enemies are staggered can be realyl annoying because you literally have to experiment multiple times while combing over every angle to figure out which performs what specific glory kill.

The story tragically is typical programmer garbage, something a bunch of stupid teenagers who are tech geeks and haven't read much in their lives would come up with.  The potential for dooms world is there buy the way in which what little story there is, is presented, is largely bad and you're really on your own to read codex's.  But long story short, the story is simply tacky and you won't even know what is really going on unless you go out of your way to stitch things together.  There is a reason for this:

Hugo on robocop as inspiration:

https://youtu.be/vsoVQWnSOfM?t=851

Watching that noclip you can see that the original devs have gotten far away from what the original doom games are about, it's sad that there is no modding or level editing tools because the doom community would have went ape-$h*t and fixed all sorts of things that were wrong with the game.

At this point in time I can safely say doom 2k16 is a skippable fps and you should only get it at a discount.  The game has very little replayability.  The multiplayer is largely dead unless you use the ""Teamplay option"" since the way they coded the game is screwed up compared to quake where you'd just run your own dedicated server.

All in all Doom 2K16 is a typical one shot game, you go through the campaign and simply never touch it again."
It's 2020 and this game still has bugs that cause lock-ups and crashes to desktop. Skip it and wait for Doom Eternal and hope they don't screw up like they did with this game.
Pretty good.
"I loved the classic doom games, also doom3, but this one is not at all as good as expected.
The gun fights are not challenging, grenade explosions sound really weak, the music is annoying.
Instead of creating an intimidating and thrilling atmosphere they made every room full of flickering lights combined with annoying villains or advisors talking to you on speakers.
The levels seem to consist mostly of arena-like-fights, where you have to eliminate a couple of waves of enemies, and when you killed them all you are allowed to proceed.
I can see that many people have fun with this game. And if the gore and the fast paced shooting action suffice to call it a great game, well then ok. I got bored really quickly."
"The game is VERY boring, for me at least. Graphically is ok and everything seems to be fine - but it is too little to make this game great (or even good). The Doom 3 was fantastic comparing to this one. Anyway, it is my opinion."
"Game crash. Save file corrupt.

Try every fix online. Save file corrupt.

Download a save from online. Save file corrupt."
"I struggle to see why this game gets such high praise and love, in my opinion, it's average AT BEST.

The gameplay is boring and super repetitive. You would think that coming from the ID Software - the pioneers behind FPS shooter genre would bring a game into more dynamic experience, but nope, the only one mechanic that remotely resembles the said trait is a double jump, which essentially feels too arcadey and less engaging as a result, compared to the sprint/bunny hop mechanic which in the game of this caliber should be essential, otherwise it becomes boring with lack of speed.

And boring it sure is, the level design is uninspired. While levels are big, vast, and often has not only linear but vertical progression(for secrets and stuff) it often feels like a chore. Doomguy is very slow, so trying to find more secrets and items is a tiresome process. It doesn't have any sprint mechanic(like in OG games), it doesn't have any bunnyhopping(like in a Painkiller game, which essentially is the same single-player arena-based shooter) There's no real sense of speed, so the combat feels lacking as well.

Art direction and the graphic design are very shallow and don't have any type of details, that were present in Doom 3 in its unique setting of horror and dark tight corridors. Having the headline such as the RIP & TEAR tells you everything from a start with a very self-explanatory fashion - this is a passable experience with zero details or depth. As a result, you have a game with pretty, but uninspired visuals, that have that very distinct purpose to the player of being overwhelming and easy to notice. Everything is lit and colorful, enemies have that plastic feel to their bodies, making encounters feel all the same with no lack of character to the enemy. There's no sense of self-presence, you won't feel engaged in the scene of the combat, as the atmosphere is lackluster.

And then there's a problem with gameplay standpoint. A glory kills the mechanic which essentially is a legit press F to kill. It feels repetitive just after the first 20 mins of playing a game which says a lot. And since it's tied into the game design, it's pretty hard to play without it, because it's a tool to refill your ammo and health. It's one of those bad game design choices, that makes this glory kill encounter a mess every time. It messes up the flow of the combat, you see the same animations over and over again with zero transition frames so the scene looks rough all the time. It even locks your fov from customized 130 to the 90 just for this animation sequence. So much for smooth gameplay, I guess. Not to mention the constant problems with the movement. Apparently, doomguy can't move freely over the 5cm cables on a floor, stopping all the movement momentum.

It's a mess of a game in my opinion — boring, uninspired and gameplay gimmick doesn't add up to it. It feels dated, Bulletstorm or Painkiller is a better example of games that done right in this regard.

Not to mention the classics of Serious Sam, which frankly, albeit having almost non-existent budget compared to this title, had a much more engaging soundtrack, than your average WUB-WUB. At least Sam could keep my interest throughout the whole game.

Still trying to complete it through the power of my effort, but can't be bothered to play more than 30 minutes. It's just not an impressive or engaging title. Just as your typical Bethesda really - average work, commonly even less than that, but overhyped to the magnum opus standards.

I can't agree with that, will not agree with that."
"Jumping on levels was fun in Super Mario Bros.,  but this is like pushing Boston dynamics' robot off the cliff. Over and over again. Occasionally some zombie-demon-alien- meat bags emerge, you shoot them, and continue climbing that frigging tower. Why should I play this when it's not fun?"
took five hours to get of a black screen
"A very boring shooter, compared to Brutal Doom or Doom 3, not to mention modern shooters like Wolfenstein."
When you play doom 2016: PEGGERS
"Just really underwhelming. More like Painkiller than Doom.

Looks nice and the shooting is fine, but the general repetitive gameplay loop of rooms locking down and several waves of enemies becomes tedious as ""hell"". Just Play original Doom wads via GZdoom instead, as it's far more satisfying."
"Like it's a'ight. It's just mega over hyped as everything else sucks so bad at the moment.

I'm a moany old man who grew up on Doom/Doom II, my major issue is that this game doesn't get the atmosphere right, It looks like greasy plasticine with a lego man and feels like every other generic sci-fi FPS from the last decade. Just compare the Cyber Demons, one looks like a horrific tortured monster with machinery butchered onto its body and the other looks like a big purple teddy bear wearing a bin liner. The story is dumb, but sort of fun, but mainly dumb, at least they didn't mention anything about pet rabbits. I feel sorry for Bethesda who get picked on by consumers for expecting a billion dollar games company to lip sync the only character with lips and about three lines of dialogue, in protest to these greedy ungrateful gamer's Bethesda have refused to bother fixing any bugs in this game. 

This game is like the fun brightly coloured kids TV show version of Doom 3 and that's where it works. It's fun and it's fast and you don't have to think about it too much. It's the antidote to every game with regenerative health and aiming from behind cover. 

doom 2016 is fine, its just to me its more of a remake of Corridor 7 than Doom. I think the new Bethesda Wolfenstein games are better and more interesting and I would recommend them instead."
"The game play starts fun but gets super repetitive by being balanced around executions (which means the action stops for a little cut scene), and also still suffers from technical issues.  Load time are terrible at all stages of the game including the initial loading,you can't skip the idiotic villain ranting cut scenes, multiple monitor doesn't work properly.  Essentially any time you are not actively in control of your character and shooting is the time when the game is absolute garbage.  The time when you are in control and actually playing is IMO not quality enough to justify the issues."
for some reason i get this fatal error screen every time i launch it and the game refuses to work im worried i just wasted my money....
"Ammo, health and armor scarcity makes this game a very annoying thing to play.
Add to that the necessity to be constantly making quick time events to restore ammo and health. 

There is a great game hidden in here, but these mechanics just ruin what could have been one of the best fps ever."
"What would be a really fun demon slaying fun by utterly one track mind protagonist (don't look for deeper story - it is not here - you are here just for gory fun) is severely marred by totally idiotic decision to lock progression behind secrets (which now are MANDATORY if you do not want to be a gimp) and totally retarded challenges (which takes you out of the fun part of the game and shoves into a tiny map with stupid objective with totally retarded restrictions) which - surprise - are also mandatory, if you don't want extra ""challenge"" playing as a gimp. Do you remember good old days where secrets and challenge bullshit were OPTIONAL? Yea, good old days.. Too bad they are gone..."
vomit feeling
"This game sucks. For one, it takes up 70GB of space when it's completely unnecessary. (Shows that the dev team didn't k now how to efficiently store their data) Playing the game is just like any other FPS, but it's just so stripped down. There's no semblance of a storyline, you move WAAAAAYYYY too fast which is disorienting, and the drops don't add anything to the challenge.

I literally just glory killed all of the mobs everywhere straight through the second chapter of the game. If I die, I restart nearby where I died, so it doesn't add to the challenge.

It just doesn't hold my attention, and I see why it's only a $6 game. It could have been really good if they gave it some effort."
"SHIT HUMAN BEINGS IN MULTIPLAYER WHIOI FUCKING XCHEaT, FUCK THEM"
"It didn't feel challenging or fun. The guns felt blase and hit like nerf. The enemies were just bullet sponges, nothing special. Not the game I remember from my childhood."
