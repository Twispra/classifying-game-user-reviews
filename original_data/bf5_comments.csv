fucking let le skip your shit animations. they are FUCKING HORRIBLE And make no fucking sense.You butchered the people whom fought in this war and made them sound like littel faggots. fuck dice. fuck battlefield devs. They all deserve to burn.
leveling up pistols is pointless no camos no upgrades
i can't event play game. RTX 4070 super can't event play with 60fps. Optimize so bad
could've been better if there is no 500 lvl cheaters suck my nuts EA worst game ever
Going from BF1 to this slop was insane whiplash. Extreme downgrade in every aspect. Nordlys campaign in particular was especially disgusting.
"EA need to get over themselves with their anti cheat crap!! I just want to play the single player version but when i go to load it comes up with ""the latest version of EA anti cheat is required to play! It installed the crappy anti cheat after i wasted my time downloading 90gig worth of data!! If the latest version isn't on the game files then too bad! i shouldn't have to jump through bloody hoops just to play a game that  i've paid good money for!!!! What a joke!!"
got bored fast recommend if you want something temporary to play and waste you'r money
no
not worth the 2euro
The game doesn’t even work on the steam deck. Waste of money. I was really looking forward to playing it.
dying simulator all i can say
not for 2025
"literally unplayable. The back button doesnt work in the main menu forcing me to alt f4, every time i restart the game i have to play through the unskippable intro again, forgets all my settings. I am not playing the intro mission for the third time"
Battlefield 1 is way better then this
unplayable game
BF1 >>>>
Cant even launch this shit. I hate ea games :(
badbad
"With DRX or DLSS, the game is unplayable. Yes, I know it was early days, and they subtly warn you in the settings, but even without it, the game still runs terribly. Transport and camera constantly twitch like they're lagging behind the render. With all complex settings turned off, I’m getting an average of about 100 FPS, but 1% lows drop to 30-40—and, of course, the dips always happen at the worst moments.

I spent some time researching and found tons of articles and discussions about people experiencing inconsistent FPS and performance drops on the PC version. You have to tweak settings, disable DX12, stick to medium quality, and so on—but I’m over it. A mainline AAA title from a major studio with a $200 million budget shouldn't run like this."
APEX is offering another perk—simply click to uninstall and you'll free up 82.75GB of hard drive space for free.
"played it with friend long ago on multi, the game feels bad, kinda funky in a way, didn't really enjoy it"
unable to connect ea server
Retared ass game built shittly give me battlefield 4 back
"Horrendous. I don't want to hear female voicelines squeal in my ear every 30 seconds in various languages. Especially, in a World War 2 setting. Extremely obnoxious autism. Hope the devs are robbed of their ability to interact with computers for the rest of their god forsaken lives on this planet. OR they lose their hands entirely"
The beginning of the almost end for the Battlefield franchise.
Next game is going to have child soldiers if this garbage keeps up.
"Эту игру можно описать одним предложением: ""Отваренный лучшим поваром в мире, максимально красиво уложенный в вашу тарелку, мишленовский кал"".
Игра невероятно красивая. Все эти взрывы, эффекты, в целом пейзажи, но геймплей это просто ужас. Во-первых, вы играете абсолютно одинаковые миссии, просто по факту на разных картах. Что-то типа ""Доберитесь до нужного места, по пути вырезая сотни врагов, привет реализм"", потом ""захватите 3 населённых пункта в одиночку, тоже реалистично очень"", ну и конечно же в конце нужно оборонять этот опорный пункт, пока на вас спустили все самолёты, танки и артиллерию с пехотой в ближайших 500 км.

Отдельно хочу выразить мерзость миссий в Норвегии. При всём уважении к женскому полу, но каким образом 15-ти летняя девочка даёт за щеку целым базам немцев, потом гуляет со своей мамой, которая одета только в футболку в -35, на мосту их берут в окружение с двух сторон и казалось бы, вот и всё, спускайте курок и наших героев нет, но зачем-то немцы начинают с ними болтать, потом мама трагично обнимает и скидывает дочку с СЕРЕДИНЫ моста, дочь как-то выживает от падения где-то с 20-30 метров, потом непонятно почему начинается красивая, но абсолютно тупая часть миссии, где ГГ холодно и ты ходишь по местности и ищешь костёр чтобы согреться (за 3 минуты без огня вы умрёте от переохлаждения, логично!), потом в определённый момент важная книга, которую нам отдала мама, каким-то хером вылетает из нашего инвентаря (вы же тоже документы будете хранить не внутри когда идёт метель, а снаружи, да?), мы подскальзываемся и падаем в ледяное озеро, которое почему-то не замёрзло, как всё остальное вокруг, каким-то образом и так с переохлаждением не теряем сознание и не получаем судороги в воде -30 градусов, а выплываем, доходим ещё 5 минут до домика, где сидит немец, который нас заметил и вот спустит курок, но мы же ГГ, мы с переохлаждением и обморожением конечностей берём бутылку вина и лупашим немца по голове, от чего он падает на колени, а потом мы, 15-ти летняя девочка с переохлаждением, начинаем его душить и побеждаем, после чего сразу падаем без сознания у дверей. И вот бы всё, теперь точно конец, ведь ты умрёшь от переохлаждения во сне, но нет! Чудо света! Наша героиня, хорошенько подремав, просыпается уже утром и собирается в новые начинания.

Гениальный сюжет! Хлопая стоя. А если серьёзно, то ощущение, что сюжет писала феминистка, которая ушла из Диснея, где делала мультики для 5-ти летних детей, где в мире всё хорошо и цветут цветочки. 
Покупайте игру максимум за графику, но вот такие однотипные сюжеты, просто один в Африке, а второй в Норвегии, вам надоедят примерно после прохождения арки 1 персонажа."
please release firestorm as a separate game it seems like such a good idea but no one is gonna buy BF5 just to play it
"It requires a separate launcher.
It's woke.
Its campaign is too short."
"Such a massive step back from BF1, arguably the best Battlefield game they've made. It's actually that much of a step back it really makes you wonder what the hell were they thinking. All they had to do was basically re-skin BF1 and it would've been incredible"
buggy af
lots of bugs
"Poorly polished game, bad in-game mechanics, horrible sound design and childish campaign. Would never recommend after playing such an amazing game as Battlefield 1."
Se ve tan bonito que no veo a nadie

"The game is a joke. Buggy, tanks are too strong, hit reg, and dsync are a joke, im playing cheaters and for some reason there are women running around the battlefields of WW2."
garbage game
ass
lag
trash
fKING hACKERAS LAGGY SHITTY
Need origin to play it.
i down vote every game that has 3rd party account required
this game sucks
I got this game as part of a sale deal with a bunch of other battlefield games a few years ago. I had heard many rumours about how poor the quality of this game was for a battlefield entry. I finally decided to give it a go here recently. I can wholeheartedly tell you that this game is a terrible entry for the series. It is beyond frustrating how the graphics stutters beyond belief. There's no real sense or rhythm to any of the maps. The classes are lackluster. the weapons are boring. This game is a huge disappointment and I didnt have high expectations going in.
"I only played campaign so here's the review for the campaign.
It sucked. The story was great but the gameplay is repetitive. Only the ""The Last Tiger"" campaign that felt different (and the greatest one). Compared to Battlefield 1's campaign, it's just bad."
This game is so UNBALANCED and doesn't make any sense for the time period. No hardcore mode. Dog shit mechanics.
nothing  spec rly...
"Played this game in like 2019 or something.
Was a buggy mess.
Wanted to try it again
Got the following error message:

Fuck EA."
Game sucks
this game sucks dont buy it also peatear just went 1 and 9
Battlefield 1 better
"Poor optimization, constantly getting disconnected from games even though ping is in single digits. Online games are filled with hackers/cheaters and nothing is being done about them (Typical EA), which is a shame since online can be quite enjoyable without hackers."
GOT HACKED :(

TEAM CAN NOT PTFO
"The gameplay feels worse than BF1, is too light and arcady for a war setting. On that, the historicity of this game is atrocious, and made me very angry, as an historian who enjoys games. The game looks a bit prettier than BF1, but it's optimazation is worse, surprising since it's the same engine

5(V)/10"
"Really great software, EA. I just love how changing any of my monitor settings either crashes the game or makes my pc restart. Well done."
GARBAGE
full of cheaters
its aight...
"I am going to not recommend Battlefield V because I look at it from the modern Battlefield perspective, which is characterised by excessive destruction. There, I find Battlefield V to be significantly lacking. Perhaps a bit puritanical from my perspective, but I can't see Battlefield V as a ""true"" Battlefield.

However, if you're looking for a less modern Battlefield and for something more in the vain of late early-mid 00s WWII shooters, then this is actually a decent option."
"big L for battlefield V! why the sigma cant i simply pick the side i want to play? why cant we choose sides when the teams are already balanced? the inability to switch sides of this game is incomprehensible, thats why i uninstalled"
dogs**t maps
"I love not being able to regenerate my health! Random recoil (spread to recoil conversion) is a very good idea for a video game guys! I love being laserbeamed across the entire map from a location that I didn't even know existed! If you caught on the sarcasm, just go play Battlefield 4, 3 through Venice Unleashed, or Bad Company 2 through Rome."
"I hate a game that has so much potential only to let you down. It reminds me of my ex wife, you think you got something good then the nightmare starts."
enfia o tank junto com o avião no 🆒
"Hard to say that is worth to buy. Lots of teams and squads playing in group than sometimes can eliminate the whole lobby and there is nothing you can do about it. If you are going to play alone, I cannot recommend it."
"This game is mediocre as hell. The visuals are good, everything else sucks. The characters are cringe-y with bad voice acting. The maps are uninspiring, even more so when you take into account that this is a WWII game. The gunplay is arcade-y. There is no hardcore mode. This and 2042 feel like Temu Battlefield are soulless rubbish. Save time and money and play BF4 and BF1."
"TERRIBLE game, literally cannot see any players in this game regardless of graphic settings. They just blend in with everything i can hear them great but thats all. Visibility is the worst of any FPS i've played and thats like 15 years of experience. I would rather deal with sbmm in CoD than not be able to see where im being shot from. Game is for rats DO NOT BUY!"
gods most devious punishment toward humanity was allowing this game to be made
takes 10 minutes to boot up
cesspool of humanity
so bad !!!
The game is very unoptimized playing with friends. Keep getting kick out of the game
trash
"Too many cheaters. I've ran into 3-4 games where there was a hacker dominating the whole team, making the game unplayable."
How they missed the mark so much from Battlefield 1? Unplayable.
"a washed down, sweatier version of bf1"
trash game
dogshit
"Fuck you, garbage EA server"
"After absolutely loving playing battlefield 1, I played this at beta and then didn't return until after the season passes had ended because I thought things might improve. It did not.

Vehicles do not make any sound unless right next to you, which adds to them being especially deadly and yet impossible to kill. A directional damage system for vehicles that only half works causes most hits to do about 5 damage to a vehicle with 100 health. Add to that that the dynamite has been massively nerfed, AA options are nonexistent and the ammo pouches which every support player in the game is defaulted to not giving ammo for gadgets all makes for insanely frustrating combat against vehicles. I have tried everything within the arsenal and somehow even on hardcore servers lunge mines seem to be the most viable antitank option which is frankly fucking insane. Suppression does absolutely nothing after being nerfed from the last game. OCE servers are practically dead too.

Overall this is an insultingly bad entry to the series, and following it up with a weak launch for 2042 has put me off ever giving one of these a chance again.
Poor balancing on several fronts, and a lack of features like autobalancing for teams are the icing on the wet turd of a cake that this game is that leads to one sided matches where level 500 players use meta weapons to thoroughly stomp out any interest you might have in the game even on sale."
i hate the snipers
"I really had hope for this because I used to play this all the time when it was released. The game has changed so much since then and I really wanted to relive the good days of Battlefield. It is impossible now.

There are so many hackers/cheaters on every server. It is impossible to play. Between Wall hackers and aimbot, to planes being able to spot you from across the entire map. DICE needs to have all of their games removed from any platform and it needs to be free to play now. They do nothing to fix the hacks and cheats. It is rampant in all battlefields. DO NOT BUY! Waste..."
no working steamdeck new update  before was working
"EA blocks all Proton, Wine, and Steam deck users. Alienating an entire community from playing, can't recommend bad business practices."
Just get Battlefield 1.
"EA fucking sucks ass, and they barely maintain these games anymore, also very historically inaccurate"
sh@@@t game
stick a rod in my balls and shoot a load on my chest cus holy fk this game is annoying
"Battlefield. For the fifth time.

Remember, war never changes.

(Btw BF1 better.)"
worse battlefield 1
"Great game, but packet loss, cheaters everywhere?
Nope!"
"The audio is trash. Selected every setting and saved it, didn't do a damn thing. Removed my headset, played through the speaker and it was the same result. 

Single player is similar to shorts on Youtube.
Multiplayer is like finding a needle in a haystack. Good luck finding a match."
"Logged in after three years of not playing just to see all my progress was wiped, contacting EA support did nothing."
BF1 was better
shit
"Spawn. Die. Spawn. Die.
Spawn. Die. Spawn. Die.
Spawn. Die. Spawn. Die.

Repeat.

2/10."
"the games pretty fun if your a good player, the action and fast paced gameplay is what i like to see. Although as for the campaign they are just trashy and buggy while i cant even play them if i wanted too since i just get nocliped or stuck halfway through, i don't get what the problem is and i'm not looking foward to fixing it"
i have ptsd
"Okay, let's be honest - installing EA Anti-Cheat is acceptable, since other games nowadays have the same (e.g. CS2, Team Fortress 2, but for Valve games, it's built into the game as their devs of Steam). Here the game doesn't recognize it, I managed to launch the game only on the 3rd attempt, because the previous attempts returned an error that the Anti-Cheat program was outdated. The next account check - I didn't receive a security code for 10 minutes, and after a while my mailbox received a spam of 3 emails (I asked for a confirmation code three times). Finally, the gameplay after a quick setup of the controls, weapons for each class - I joined multiplayer sessions with my friends and at first three times in a row after appearing I couldn't move. The matches themselves are not interesting because of the presence of cheaters, regardless of your system, and the only way out is to start or join another game.

Definitely, the game does not deserve to be purchased, I received it as a gift, however I will remove this game from my library in the end."
"The stories are fun and the online gameplay is entertaining. The game is so extremely unstable that I can't recommend it. I have tried all types of changes in settings including fps limitations and lowering the graphics settings. To finish the first story (takes about 1-2 hours if you aren't a very skilled player like me) and it took me about 6 hours total because of how many crashes it had. I tried playing online and it was the same thing. Disappointing experience, especially since I tend to like Battlefield games."
it's a joke
"Women screaming in pain that make your ears bleed. You got bunch of custom characters/custom weapon skins that further ruin the immersion. Gun play is so arcadey its pathetic little to no recoil whatsoever. And the downed feature where you are waiting for a revive is downright the dumbest game feature added to any Battlefield game, takes so long to respawn.

The only pros are incredible graphics and sound design, but everything else is just disappointing. This game will forever go down as a shit stain in the Battlefield franchise and straight up disrespects WW2 in every way possible."
ภาค 1 สนุกกว่า....
"Just cheaters, no way to compete against them"
Game dynamics suck. This game is big pile of steaming turd. Stay away from it.
"There's absolutely no need to write a lengthy review discussing why this game is garbage. It's garbage. The multiplayer is packed with cheaters and the single player campaign is insultingly bad. They put literally no effort into the single player whatsoever. I could take mediocre storytelling or dull settings or what have you, but for fuck's sake the underlying game mechanics don't even work properly. Do not waste money on this even on sale. And yes, it's tempting to buy this at $2.50 because what do you have to lose?

$2.50, and briefly your sanity. That's what you have to lose."
Too many cheaters. Current Anticheat cant deal with autospawn killing (which stops all players from playing) and the last update for anticheat has been YEARS. The game is dead until the new one. Classic EA. I will remove this review for 5.99 if EA is reading this.
i have 6 hours of play time tried to come back and play again and im (banned) because EA is a terrible company thats doesnt know how to make a game playable
EA.
"Gameplay is normal Battlefield fare, actual gunplay is fine, fluid, and plays well. There are some minor quirks such as animation locking that you can't avoid, such as when you get tossed an ammo or medpack, however generally its a smooth experience.

The problem is twofold, the monetization, and the cheating. Monetization is god awful and you're forced to do unfun co-op missions to get a healthy amount of company coin if you wish to avoid spending real money. Cheating is rampant on DICE official servers, people blatantly aimbotting on fresh accounts (or old ones), teleporting, but the major issue currently is also plaguing the community servers - which previously acted as a bastion against cheating and abuse - but are now also facing problems. People can join into ANY server as a spectator and force crash the server, and if the community isn't actively moderating there's nothing that can be done. Unfortunately the community servers for this game have been mostly abandoned with admins/mods just simply not bothering. 

DICE games, especially ones on maintenance mode, end up turning into cheater-ridden or exploitative messes at the end of their life. For $3, it was worth the time, but the frustrations began piling on after servers kept being crashed and nothing is being done."
EA specifically making sure that I get put on the braindead team that gets curbstomped every match
"tankfest the game, honestly crazy how one mechanic just makes this game unplayable garbage. 

Like this make black ops6 look good.

actual trash no real fps skill needed just tank sit on hills and be a lifeless loser 

i actually refunded my 2.50 for this trash, can't even justify that price for how garbage it is"
unplayable with the glitches and hackers
Purchased after watching video... too many hackers! Not recommended!
it works for one or two days and then it keeps on crashing !
The game has lots of wasted potential.
"buns game, dead servers, sweaty cunts who dont get off will shit on you, worse than seige"
"After playing this game during the very beginning of its life on my Xbox back in the day I will say this game was a massive missed opportunity to be a great game. I like the gun play, and the mechanics of it are really good, its fun, however. The balancing, bugs, lame maps, and awful wacky cosmetics ruin it for me. Wish this game leaned more on the historically accurate side, like why make a WW2 game if you make the soldiers not look like their from WW2, and why in the hell would you make maps based on the lesser know battles of WW2?! The amazing sound design of BF1 is gone, this game is so damn quiet. For a war game I expect roaring gunshots and loud explosions with soldiers screaming all around, like in BF1. This game is so quiet. Also they abandoned this game way to soon, and near the end of its life they decide to make better maps that should have been in the game in the first place, and then they released historically accurate cosmetics when the game is done being developed!?!? What thinking is this!? I appreciate trying to make the game be more historically accurate, but its 2 years to late! Like whats the point!? Doesn't help that the game is full of such awful looking soldiers, doesn't matter that they added better looking cosmetics since everyone looks so ugly. Also this game has no team balancing, like your whole team can leave leaving only you on your own and the enemy team would still have like 32 people on it... Great job DICE and EA..."
uneducated
"i bought this game just to play the story mode (single player) yup i was disappointed, there not much to play & the playable thing you no control on the story its like you're watching a history movie, not to mention i cant play offline unless i open the ea app online , so you need internet to play"
"It has terrible stories except the last tiger and is definitely unfinished, the multiplayer games are mediocre at best. Honestly, if you got enough cash just buy BF1 that game is golden compared to this."
not fun
The fucking leafs can block a Kar98 bullet its absolute bullshit
game is good but too much cheater
"Game's multiplayer fully stopped working after getting a new pc, no connection issues and it gives me a ""can't connect to server"". Reinstalled the game, flushed dns, tried everything I could through from what I could find on the internet. Absolute dogshit buy."
"Infested with cheaters that can doxx you, this game makes your information vulnerable. DO NOT BUY"

"I bought this on a sale for 2$ thinking it was going to be similar to BF4 with the story mode. Unfortunately this game does not have a typical campaign, it instead has 4 ""war stories"" which are mini 3 mission campaigns that take about 2 hours to complete. It aims to tell you about important events in World War 2 but you don't really end up learning a whole lot. 

So yes a story mode is non existent.

I really don't know about multiplayer. I tried to get in to a match, I tried every single gamemode out, but it seems like this game is completely dead as I failed to get in to a single online match.

The game is also pretty poorly optimized and requires the EA launcher and anticheat which are just extra bloatware and spyware. 

I would not play this game if it was free. And I would have refunded my 2 petty dollars if I hadn't exceeded the 2 hours of playtime."
This wont open EA is also dogshit dont buy play like some else fps ww2 game
Fcuk You EA
"Absolutely unplayable game infested with hackers, no point playing if Dice or whoever does not ""fix"" this.

I give a 4 for game play, variety of weapons and vehicles, graphics and maps.

Don't waste your time.

4/10"
"easily the second worst battlefield title besides 2042. why the fuck are there women fighting on the frontlines ? did the devs not do their homework? the guns feel terrible, the game flows terribly and immersion is ruined by many inaccuracies. For me , a fan of history, the game just aint it.
Not to mention the blatant cheating thats still going on in multiplayer lobbies. I really want to refund this steaming pile of manure."
"Battlefield 1, but worse in almost every way."
"The gameplay is fun and feels pretty dynamic, but I can't freaking see the enemy. The game has great visibility issues to the point where i just can't enjoy playing it anymore. Plus, the game is abandoned, so they aren't going to fix any problems. Go and buy BF1, if you haven't done so before"
"I like the game, sort of. But it's easily the worst BF game of all time. I know I'm late, but it feels like they heard the complaints that some people had regarding BF1's gameplay approach of simplicity and said ""fuck it, make everything more complicated!"" 

The game is just kind of mechanically bad. I like the movement, but it feels like it traded smoothness for complexity and I don't know if that's necessarily a good thing. Vehicle rape is bad. Anti-vehicle gameplay in-turn is not good. Gun-play is fine but the remaining servers outside of the US have a ping levels that make it unplayable most of the time. Maps are pretty forgettable. Visibility is garbage. The color palate is dark and muddy, and not in an immersive way. Lastly, Attrition was unnecessary and a general misstep in evolving the series past it's kind of antiquated gameplay systems -- nice try I guess?

OH --- and there's cheaters everywhere lol"
Never coming back again. Worst spent money.
"I just bought it to play online, but game unexpectedly crashes after finding a match."
"The game crashed after completing all the tutorials, and it did NOT save anything... it wants to force me to play all that shit again, even though i'm a veteran player (took me 30minutes)

I won't risk doing it all again if it decides to crash again.

I would not recommend you buy this garbage, i will request a refund."
"EA wants us to think their launching system is better than the one from Steam, and it makes their game unplayable."
"Invasive ""anti-cheat"", collecting players information, janky unfun gameplay and the worst, absolutely laziest singleplayer, if you can even call it that. Also tons of obvious cheaters, apparently they are left to be despite the invasive anti-cheat?
Virtually nothing has been improved, yet many things drag behind earlier iterations, say battlefield 4 for example. Map design has been awful for a long time, and decline just won't stop. Not worth any money to get slapped by cheaters and bad game design, plus intrusions in technical aspects"
"tl;dr: it's not fun.
Movement is slow and janky, gunplay is awful - too much aiming sway and horizontal recoil makes it a frustrating experience.
Large maps with very little cover turns every game into a snipefest.
Vehicles are extremely difficult to access, they are almost always taken. Devs should consider implementing them similarily to the most recent Battlefront 2.
My desperate plea to EA is to look at what other devs are doing, and how BF compares in terms of gameplay.
Battlefield is standing with one foot in the grave, because devs mismanaged it for the past decade. EA already killed the Medal of Honor franchise, and unless they start actually caring about the product, the same will happen to Battlefield."
"What a disappointment! I was hoping for the Battlefield 1 experience but with a WW2 setting and what I got was a giant pool of cheaters wearing skins that look like they got pulled out of Rainbow Six Siege.

You (The new player) don't get to fight back on an even playing field because everyone else has unlocked the ""Specializations"" that make guns do more damage, fire faster, ADS faster, etc etc. You have to hit your head against the BF5 brick wall for hours and hours just to unlock a fraction of the stats the level 500 guy has. 

That's to say if you even get into a lobby without blatant cheaters ruining it for everyone. You'll be lucky to just get an aimbotter, 25% of matches my squad was put into had cheaters ""Force respawning"" everyone in the lobby, rendering it completely unplayable.

Oh and you need to give EA full access to your operating system so their anti-cheat can be absolutely useless. Very cool."
slow running slow reloading unaccurate shooting very low health
Game is buggy asf. cant even play it for some reason and EA will always kick you out of ur profile for some reason.
female characters in this game is retarded
"Might as well be world of tanks. As a new player, it is not a fun learning experience to face tanks that just perch themselves at the top of a map and fire below. There's not enough coordination to take these things out- anti tank characters do not have enough ammo to land 3-5 hits to take these out. At least give anti vehicle characters enough anti-tank ammo to feel like they can accomplish something- a coordinated tank squad that's repairing the tank is a horrible experience against random allies that will not work together. Glad game was only $3"
"This game is absolute garbage, this game is flooded with cheaters that makes it unplayable
I wish the employees of EA the worst in the world for this sh!t they have programmed"
"this battlefield V is legit shit. the game is beautiful. but the weapon system is shit, the maps are stunning but shit, way to few players, legit running simulator, or if in a tank or plane, enjoy being farmed. There is nothing fun about it."
"This game is so frustratingly close to being amazing, but it just kinda sucks."
"very bad game in multiplayer... good in singleplayer...very cinematic and choppy laggy cutscene

multiplayer dont worth your time... alot hacker,saw someone glitching around.. shoot through wall...alot gun dont do much damage even headshot... mostly sniper.. im really frustrated why my sniper need to shoot someone 3 bullet to kill even headshot but enemy shoot me just one shot... same with other guns"
anti cheat does not allow me to play kinda bs
"I literally watched the leaderboard as my team had 22 people on it, the enemy had 28. They gave the enemy team another 3 people, making it 22-31. Fuck. You."
one of the worse games i ever played. 4/10. not fun. boring. not even competitive.
1st match in and there is a blatant cheater killing everyone. Good job EA keep making your games like this.
Just a lame game of campers !~
"For this price,it's a piece of shit"
no
easy anti cheat broken now
"Fuck you EA, can't easy install/play. Got error on start up to turn on game from your distribution platform. Fuck you!"
"Gameplay is good but there is no Red Army, too many cheaters, no bots on the battlefield, many women and disabled people with prostheses, which completely nullifies historical authenticity, in general, the game is not about the Second World War, but about the war in the imagination of Americans. Disgusting company, calling to sympathize with the defeat of the fascists."
"Spawn - die - spawn - die - spawn - die - spawn die

I remember playing battlefield 1942 20 years ago and it was fun but this is trash"
I couldn't do the Nazi salute
"Still A buggy mess, Single Player has dispicable stuttering, cast and voice acting are fantastic but the gameplay is the worst since the series began. Battlefield has truly lost its way....."
In the campaigns I randomly out of no where cannot switch or use my weapons and have to last checkpoint to fix it and it is very annoying.
the game is done
This would be a lot more fun if the game didn't randomly stop letting me change weapons when I use equipment like binocs or the skis. only fix is quitting the mission and reloading.
Feels bad to play compared to BF1
"How can I get a refund. This game doesn't load?????
I instaled this game  - it loaded to the menu screen and i went to the firing range... then crashed - I uninstalled it then reinstalled it and it didn't load at all. I want my money back! My computer runs BF1 and Insurgency perfectly - but this won't run at all. 
I have absolutley no idea why Steam clocked me at playing this game for over 103 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!! I saw the firign range for 15 minutes before it crashed!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Very buggy game, Cutscenes dont work for me, overall this game is verry buggy for me and unless this game somehow works for you i wouldent recomend playing"
This game is a corpse. Murdered by the ones who once made a great series called Battlefield. Now it's CoD except not good. I sometimes wish I was mentally disabled so I could enjoy the fruit of idiots labor.
"bunch of type2a losers,dont buy this game."
"This is literally just a far worse version of BF1 in every feasible aspect.

Looks worse, plays worse, performs worse with constant stuttering (RTX 4070 Ti SUPER + Intel i7 9700K, btw), and feels worse. Maps are worse, enemies are bullet sponges, and more...

Overall, just get BF1; it's a far better and more enjoyable experience."
"Spent around 20 hours playing in Open Beta in August 2018. Just realized the game has same bugs with merging HUD and menu screens, not spawning after being killed and revived at the same time, etc. You can play with absolutely unrealistic skins looking like dudes wearing leather jacket from 80s looking like Tom Cruise from Top Gun, women with metal hands, etc. This game was joke of WWII and still is, even after years. Highly recommend to give a chance Squad 44 or Hell Let Loose. Refunded.

4/10"
"The campaign is great, do not misunderstand me, but optimization... My lord, even if on my PC with RTX 2060 this game lags as hell, I don't know what will happen with weaker devices. Good luck completing this laggy excuse of a Battlefield which lazy ###holes from EA didn't optimize properly."
"Game is completely overrun with hackers/cheaters. Every single lobby has at least 1 cheater in it. People are constantly teleporting around, flying above and through the map. Wallhacking, aimbotting, damage cheating, and so much more bs. If I could ask for a refund I would."
"I have 300+ Hrs on console. I would have loved playing this on PC, but your dogshit launcher, seemingly designed by literal monkeys with autism, won't allow me to anymore.

Good game, ruined by shitty launcher.

Battlefield Studios better not have this dogshit."
just bad
FUCKING CHEATER
"Everyone who plays this game in 2025 is a giant fucking virgin, no you may not play the game casually and try to rank up as the game intended, no you may not fly a plane without getting immediately shot down, no you may not try to snipe, you are also not allowed to play as a tank on any map with airplanes."
F\SGA\SZGZSAG
"Green green, whats your problem green?!?"
EA app & cheaters.
I'm really convinced that I spent the original price of money and now it's too cheap to reduce the price to such a low price.
"Slop anti-cheat, not playable on Linux"
Jungle Carbine
like shit
Genuinely just not that good.
"the gun mechanics need work, other then that i just don't like how a shotgun 5 shots in doesn't leave a scratch at 10 feet but at any time a rifle can kill you from anywhere"
"EA has effectively killed this game with their new anticheat, game pins i9 at 100% cpu load on its own now.

Thanks EA."
"Bought it on sale for 2,49€ and wouln't recommend it if you wanted a World War 2 shooter as it feels like a REALLY bad cosplay of WW2

does some things right and some things wrong for a Battlefield game."
the games ass
There isn't one story about American troops in the pacific or atlantic fronts. Every story is weird and uncared about. Terrible story
BF 1 lepszy
[h1]cheaters[/h1]
"Every match you play, you will encounter a hacker. and it will map you Some people keep their names hidden after they kill you. Can't you handle any of this?"
There is no Turkish language support
game is fine but ea launcher is barely functional and prevents me from playing
"actual piece of shit game, fucking ruined, get into match get r**ped by some camper or shoot an enemy 500 times cuz you shoot nerf darts and the enemies shoot actual 50 bmg or some shit and kill you instantly, not to mention if ur new ur just gonna quit because of all the tryhards and the before mentioned nerf darts you shoot, fuck this game honestly, it was better years ago (oh yeah did i mention all the cheaters lmao? yeah this game is swarmed with them!)"
"extremely bad game, very cartoonish.

feels like it was released 3 years before battlefield 1.

also why does germany have 50% women and black people? what the..."
"if you press play then most of the time the game wont start because ea client is dogsh#t and mandatory to run the game, also some maps too small and it plays like call of duty there (if i want small map i play that trash, not this)"
Disconnect everyfuckin single time. THX MF.
Always redeploy! Too many cheaters! Glad that I bought this on sale. Gotta play the Story mode instead.
worst battlefield
"If you're not a fan of Battlefield games, then you might enjoy this one, doesn't play like the other BF's before it, and in essence feels worse off, maybe its just me, but I'm glad i bought it when it was 95% off.

don't pay full price for this"
shit game apparently
"bro ur an EA, do u guys have anti cheat huh?"
THE MATCH MAKING TO BS. you can have all nubes on your team and multiple high\max player on there.
"game sucks, vehicles ruin it, people hoard them, maps are immense and it's such a shitty experience it made me go back to battlefield 1 believe it or not."
"Cheaterfield V, even kernel level anticheat can't handle that"
Game keep crashing on cutscenes
thrash.. play bf1
"Playing on brand new, very high end pc. Game runs poorly, textures look cheap and rushed. Gameplay is boring and uninspired. Even though I got it for like 2 euro. I cannot recommend it.

I loved Battlefield 1, and ironically this feels like a cheap copy of Battlefield 1, even though Battlefield V is made two years after Battlefield 1."
"played this game a lot of hrs on the origin launcher. they update and add kernel level anti-cheat. V E R Y first game that i join has a hacker 120-0, 32k pts with closest next person at 6k pts. 

EA can never stop being awful can they?"
"dont buy this piece of shit, i've play this game for 15 hours and I I've lost my mind cuz how the f there are people who run faster than a fucking airplane, AND THE SLANTED CHINESE MAN WHO HAS AN AIM LIKE HIM HAS NEVER TOUCHED THE GROUND FOR 1 CENTURY. so dont buy this game, buy another games likes hentai game or something similar."
"fun game, lvl 500 recon players singlehandedly ruin it for me, for 2$ it's a good game though i'm probably gonna end up returning to bf1"
"steam deck not supported, i need a refund!"
"although a good graphic and quality game, but as a cod lover finding other cod like games to play, this story is just a mix. Wouldn't recommend."
Gunplay feels trash.
I will firmly say this game is a buggy mess even if you get this discounted. Just don't buy any EA published game. They don't even pay their coders or staff to keep the Battlefield franchise going.
"An unoptimized piece of crap with a shitty EA launcher. It takes 20 minutes and multiple fucking game restarts just to join a friend’s party or invite someone. YOU HAVE A TON OF MONEY, are you really this incompetent that you can't make a properly optimized invite and matchmaking system? A waste of 100GB of my bandwidth. REFUND."
Bought the game and the first match was spawncamped by cheater teleporting himself the entire match
"Even without the 1000s of cheaters this game is too arcadey.

The tanks will wip its gun around 180 in 1.2secs and blow you up when you get near"
"hot garbage. every match there is either a cheater running around or a full squad of E-Sport players with 3 ping mowing down our entire team. I have not won a single match yet. DX12 mode runs like utter shit, stutters like a mess and hasn't been fixed since release."
The EA app sucks it so bad it made my monitor into a light show.
Absolute guttershite is what EA is as a company. Stop supporting these freaks and play something worthwhile. They want us to build their games for them. STOP HELPING BUILD CASH GRABS.
best game forever and piece of shit
"Empty servers because the game is no longer supported. But thats okay, theres always at least 1-2 servers that a full and available to play.

EXCEPT, thats these servers are always hardcore (unless you get lucky), so you take more damage. Meaning a sniper rifle or revolver doesn't require a headshot and instead you can be shot in the toe with a revolver, sniper rifle or the medics jungle carbine and be 1 shot. 

It is just camping simulator with snipers camping in spawn 1 shotting your ass by shooting you in the foot. Tank players that can just sit in spawn (out of bounds) and camp next to a resupply, getting the most insane killstreak free of charge with no worries. I also like that these servers ban shitty auto reloading snipers or huge 1 bullet anti-tank rifles because they are ""TO OP"", but its okay for me to get 1 shot in the foot by a revolver or a medic using a jungle carbine thats camping near spawn."
i got banned in the EA app for no reason
I literally wouldve payed more money to not have every single weapon unlocked immediately. what is the point of playing the game lol
Players are actual garbage
EA added kernel-level anticheat (malware) making the game unplayable to Linux users. It worked fine before they made the change. Adding this kind of malware after the fact should be against the law....
downgraded bf1
There was no refund...
"I know you are going to hate me for saying this but i'd rather play Battlefield 2042 than this POS. The maps are so bland and you barely hear any foot steps in this game, it's like they just spawn out of no where."
"3/10. kinda fun multiplayer, but just way to chaotic and stressful honestly. boring to get killed by airplanes or tanks all the time. and the game modes without vehicles are few and trashy. the single player is the absolute worst."
"The accumulation of all the DEI hiring at DICE throughout the years has resulted in this soulless piece of shit, the worst Battlefield game EVER created. Somehow, it’s even worse than BF1, how the fuck is that even possible?

There are no redeeming qualities here. The maps are utter dogshit, and only about two of them can even be considered playable. The gunplay is a fucking joke, no wonder all the trash casual noobs love it. It’s a laser-beam shitfest, except when RNG decides to fuck you over and makes every shot miss for no fucking reason.

The graphics? A fucking disaster. Not only are they somehow worse than BF1, but the visibility is hands down one of THE WORST I have ever seen in a video game. And as if that wasnt bad enough, the game is a broken mess, riddled with bugs, like the fucking sound barely even working.and the vaulting system being worse than BF3. How the fuck did they manage that?

Every single person involved in making this game should be embarrassed and fucking ashamed of themselves. I am fucking done with this garbage fucking franchise that cant produce ONE playable game in 10 fucking years.

DICE, genuinely, go fuck yourself."
KEEP APEARING CONNECTION TO EA GAMES SERVER TIMED OUT BRUHHH
"The only good thing about the game is the Last Tiger mission thats it. 
You want to play multiplayer ? Well go play world of tanks literally its way better cuz here in this game if u play as anything else other than tanks you will make kills but you will loose the game. Assault with RPG ? If you dont find a ammo depo u have 2 rpg shots barely does something to a tank. You found ammo depo ? Well gj now u will do a lil bit more to the tanks. Broken af tanks broken game ITS far from what from good"
Hackerfest
cant even play it. crashes a few seconds into the game
so many cheaters just pressing a button that kills you where ever you are.. you could be in HQ in a building under the stairs and they would still get you this game is literal fecal matter leaving a dogs orifice... please contemplate playing anything else other than this lazily put together walking simulator... this game lacks everything it would need to be called a battlefield game it was so underwhelming that i had to stand up and walk outside to start vacuuming my lawn because my brain could not make sense of what reality the Devs were in when they decided to green light this whole operation this game has vandalized my pc with its very presence and will never recover i hope none of you waste your time.
Empty servers. Finally found a match and it wasn't very fun. Glad it was only 2$ during sale.
Horrible single-player experience. One man army/stealth every level gets tiring
"bought it because i used to play it 24/7 back in my xbox days, now the game is dead. it was fun while it lasted GG battlefield V"
"Even though campaign is short, it is buggy as hell to the point that you are forced to restart the campaign chapter. Good thing this game copy was grabbed for 2.49 only."
better buy battlefield 1
"Очередной бездарный высер от EA, симулятор прохождения ебаного пролога, тупо нихуя не сейвит, даже блять настройки.
Надеюсь ЕА будет след Убиками и нахуй закроются"
It's was good but ..too much cheater these day!
"The downfall of Battlefield started with this series.

I just wish DICE listens to their community just once."
This game as no anti-cheat!
when i start the game up it gives my monitor a black screen i have to turn off my computer to fix it. and was having trouble with the EA launcher this game should be considered a virus and kicked off of steam.
i hatae this  EA app..suck..still cant login to my acc..i hate app EA app
"the ea stuff sucks, the party system sucks, it sucks"
i fucking love EA
not sex
"EA launcher is horrible, the game doesn't save itself. Every time i launch it, i have to watch first mission intro and setup everything again"
when i launch the app it always crashes. Tried all fix in the internet but none of it works
Boring could fall asleep playing this game
dm game loz lam hack vaicac
Lost all my progress shit game shit company can't even save my account when they give me a random ea account whit nothing on it.
game is about bunch of losers (cheaters) whos running around 50ppl n killing em like its nothing n u cant even report em
"If it weren't for having to go through the EA launcher my review might be different, having to stare at a white screen that says ""EA"" for 30 minutes just to load into an already poorly optimized game is sort of a letdown. 
Horrible frame drops, laggy servers, and the maps themselves are mid at best. Play Hell Let Loose instead."
Trash
better on xbox one....
"bought it when it was on sale, got what i paid for"
"I pre-ordered this game on Origin. To this day, it is still my least favorite Battlefield game."
"not even for 2,5 EUR. should have bought a cheeseburger instead"
"""Please start this app from EA application.""

Do not buy this anymore. They require you to use your shitty launcher."
It's still full of bugs. I playes twice and each time I loose progress. Even settings are not saved. Even with 95% I can't recommend it.
"Campaign is worth 2 dollars, barely. You play 4 different ""campaigns"", the first three are copy paste, go to this place destroy this thing, then go to the next place destroy that thing. The last campaign is the only thing close to a linear campaign and its barely that, because you get to drive around in a tank and actually participate in the war. finished the game in 10 hours."
"Тупые блядские уебки, если вы считаете что при каждом запуске игры я мечтаю хуярить в пролог вы глубоко не то что ошибаетесь,а в пиздец каком ебаном неведении.Уебки игре 7 лет,а эту хуйню не исправили"
Removed Linux support.
despite being on steam you still have to deal with EA shitware
傻逼EA我曹寺你的🐎
"EA游戏我不敢一口气买很多然后屯着空闲时才打开了，必须买一个，立马安装看看能否进入，不行就立即退款。

吐槽下在STEAM上买的多个EA游戏都无法打开，就是没有进入游戏玩过。"
"amazing visuals and sound design made by very talented people but unfortunately sullied by not being able to disable the loud screaming women. game is obviously incredibly a-historical on all levels, which is fine because the game is pretty fun anyway, but having to constantly hear high pitched screams and yelling from not so talented voice actors isn't for everyone :)"

5/10
EAlancher is not work
"EA App is a nuisance, doesn't work most of the time"
uuuugh
"boring, tanks run the game"
"For some reason i am banned from almost every single server in this game. The only servers i can join are asian or oceanian servers where i have 200+ ping.

But onto the actual game itself, since i have played it on origins a few years ago, and is STILL complete garbage:

-As with every battlefield game, it is absolutely overflowing with cheaters with every single cheat imaginable, aimbot, ESP, godmode, invisibility, teleportation, no-clip, ETC.
-Not only that but the game is just as unbalanced as BF1 with OP guns that have 10000 fire rate and perfect accuracy and control. Oh and shotguns are still toxic and overpowered and should be removed.
-Garbage and exaggerated animations make it hard to shoot enemies who are sprinting or jogging since the model flails around like a inflatable arm-flailing tube man.
-Movement system is retarded as you can just hop around like a bunny at full speed and be unkillable while still having perfect accuracy and gun handling.
-Maps suck dong and is basically the same formula over and over again where you die from snipers all the time.
-Practice mode does not let you select your class or select which weapons you use. Seriously...
-Dumbass Cosmetics and paid models in the game are ridiculous and shouldn't be a thing. Over half of the ""Soldiers"" you will see in this game are the old Kriegsmarine general in his bright blue ceremonial outfit, or the imperial Japanese lady with tight fitting leggings and a tank top. While being able to customize your soldiers face and uniform is cool, most of the models are wildly inaccurate and look like they are something from the modern Call of Duty and completely ruins any sense of realism and just shows that the game does not take itself seriously.

Its just your average EA/DICE classic where they clearly don't care about their game or their playerbase and make the worst decisions possible while creating their game.

Bought it for 2 dollars and it is not even worth 1 penny. Refunded."
some guy's baby kept crying over the mic in my squad
its playing a game where everyone is a sniper hiding in every corner they find
game can not load
"i mean like its decent. just got stale after a while of playing, maps started getting old and boring to play on, guns started feeling quite boring, i was tired of the constant hackers/sweats constantly, the game just doesnt feel the same anymore.

And to be honest i wouldnt recommend it, only took around 13 hours of gameplay until i was just purely bored playing it"
In 2024 EA updated the game to require kernel-level anticheat to run. Would never have purchased the game if I knew this was going to happen. I just want to play the singleplayer campaign and there's no way I'll let 3rd party tamper with my OS kernel.
ea永远安装不了
EA servers are just terrible...game is good tho
neidomus
I bought this piece of ♥♥♥♥ when it was on sale for 3.50€
"As a new Aisan player I don't like this game because is I saw many Chinese or Asian players used hack aim bot ruined my gameplay. I can do nothing other than report them to Developers but they're not banned yet                
My experience was ruined by these cheaters 
Please do something STUPID DICE & EA"
"Was thinking of returning to this game until moron EA said ""mE aDd nEw AnTi ChEaT tO mAkE uNpLaYaBlE oN sTeAm DeAk CuZ mE a FiNg MoRoN"" -EA probably"
Horrendous Online game play. Apparently this hot garbage is meant to be played that way. Who came up with this BS
Fun game but I would rather stick my fist in horse shit than try to reopen and set up this game after a reinstall
Will not install.
"i live in Australia and this game has no OCE servers and there is no way to check this prior to purchase. 

i will request a refund and help OCE players figure this out before purchasing it.

best latency avaliable is 158ms so 1.58 seconds delay check screen shots i have loaded up."
"I'm not fucking paying all of that money for some cosmetics dude
The campaign is alright but it isnt as epic as I'd hoped"
Get rid of the EA launcher and than maybe ill play it

"modern shooter dogshit slop shovelware. 
probably one of the worst battlefields there is. no cover. bad weapons. dogshit aiming."
"Matchmaking sucks. Every game is a landslide and being on the opposite team is draining. Games are done within 15 minutes, vehicles killing you as you spawn sucks. War is brutal."
The game doesn't boot up at all!
the flying controls are sh1t and tons of cheaters
unplayable due to crashes
shit game. Remove tanks plzz
"""Stiff Ragdoll Physics Ruin Immersion""
While Battlefield V excels in visuals, sound design, and large-scale multiplayer battles, the lackluster ragdoll physics are a glaring disappointment. Dead bodies fall like lifeless mannequins, stiff and unnatural, completely breaking immersion in an otherwise realistic war setting.

For a game that prides itself on attention to detail — from destructible environments to historically inspired battles — it’s baffling that death animations feel so outdated. In chaotic firefights, this issue becomes even more apparent, making the battlefield feel lifeless rather than dynamic.

It’s clear that the developers prioritized performance and flashy destruction over basic physics realism, which is a shame. I can’t help but feel they could have done better in this area, especially with the Frostbite engine’s capabilities. If immersion is important to you, this might leave you disappointed."
"idiotic game, developers have forgotten this game:("
"game is good but the comunity is extremely toxic, very poor balancing of guns like type 2a and zh29, just turn the chat off"
Servers filled by cheaters.
Trash game cheaters...
piece of crap
"check my review on battlefield 2042 but this game is now plagued with a weird bug that will turn on ""share player usage data"" without notifying you, meaning that it forcibly collects data without player consent. Don't risk your data to EA. They should be investigated by the FTC for such shady practices."
the server is very bad
This is from Sydney server view but this game used to be so good on console when there was so many more servers that were damn near full but now I can only pick up 1 full or no players at all. the feel is pretty nostalgic but doesn't feel like battlefield that I remember this would be a cop if you play in larger regions but if you play in a small like me then it's a drop sadly.
GOOD EA!!!!!!
.
"As with all the other titles in the series these are great games, massively let down by a developer and a publisher who do nothing about the rampant cheat/hacks or the horrendous abusive language in the chat. Another case of a game that deserves better than the calibre of people in its fanbase."
The amount of little hacker fkrs in this game IS crazy. Then you got no life trash lvl 500 players OMFG. SO sad from the start of battlefield 20 years ago.
I only spent a dollar on this game and it still wasn't worth it. I regret wasting even just one dollar on this game. Hackers are everywhere and so are snipers and tanks. Get rid of snipers and tanks and this game could be decent.
"vehicle simulator, shoots peas unless its a head shot or a rifle, vehicle simulator, leveling and customization is jus all wrong, vehicle simulator, cant kill tanks for ish as a soldier which why even make a tank killer class if it cant take out tanks, vehicle simulator, maps design and flag placements are either ur straight winning or straight losing unless u somehow manage to get a god send lobby and it actually feels like ur fighting for the map, did i mention this might as well be world of tanks.


The little good this game has is so good. the maps themselves look absolutely amazing, teams are def better than ""no pats"", guns look and sound really nice, some of the game mechanics need to be brought back like yesterday, actually being able to hide from and enemy is really nice and vice versa, the roll over when aiming behind u when prone, the run crouched, the satisfying head shot sound, the realism is so nice, unfortunately im infected with liking battlefield so i will put more unnecessarly fustrating hours into what this is."
waste of money ea will restrict you with anti cheat errors from time to time. dont buy any of the games that need anti cheat.
"The hackers, the gameplay, the performance, the graphics, all vastly worse than Battlefield 1, just buy battlefield 1."
"Battlefield 5's multiplayer is one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had in a Battlefield game. Unbalanced teams, cheaters, etc...."
EW
Matchmaking is bad
No Eastern front =(((((
"Сюжет короткий, онлайн мертвый, игра вылетает не смотря ни на какое железо."
game so ass sobbing emoji pls pllay bf1
"I don't usually rate games but I feel like I need to this time

-The amount of bugs from the ai enemies and allies made me want to KILL MYSELF 
-The ungodly 11/10 vision of the enemies spotting you from 2km away while you're behind 5 layers of pure solid concrete makes it impossible to be stealthy like damn I don't even need to go into multiplayer to see cheaters
-Bland campaign story, it's definitely not bad, but it's definitely blander than the pasta I make at 3am. Fakeass stories
-If you love history and historical accuracy, then this game is your worst enemy

On a brighter note :
-cool realistic graphics
-you can blow up stuff 

Don't buy this shit unless it's on a big sale like -90%, I bought it on sale and I don't regret loosing like idk 3-7 bucks to this, but I would have regretted it if I had bought it on full price
Arbitrary score: 4.5/10 






(and i finished the game in extreme difficulty but steam is too scared to give me the achievement)"
Not worth the money. You will find a game then when it ends and goes to another map 90% of the players leave.
ihan vitun huono peli
"Много читеров. Странные и неудобные геймдизайнерские решения. Рудиментарная прокачка. Проблема с поиском серверов - через автопоиск кидает на полупустые или с ""ожиданием игроков"", в то время как в браузере с нормальным пингом по утрам всего один сервер."
"-It requires the trash EA app
-Woke and fake WW2 stories
-The graphics are somehow worse than BF1
-The multiplayer is full of hackers. Don't even bother
-Bad level design and AI with lots of bugs and glitches"
"The good;
- Campaign puts in effort to tell a story beyond gunfire and explosions.
- Campaign shows parts of the war which we don't often see, such as Norway (as opposed to the usual D-Day, Market Garden & Stalingrad portrayals).
- Graphics are nice.
- The sounds is also nice; guns sound lethal which also helps with immersion.

The bad;
- Loads of historical inaccuracies. Not just minor ones, but major ones as well. This game is pure fantasy and put so little effort in historical accuracy that it's almost disrespectful to the people that actually fought and lived through the war.
- Stories in the campaign are overdramatised making the stories feel fake and the characters feel unrelatable.
- Animations of characters feel off. Movement feels weird, both in your own FPV and in other characters. Movements are very exaggerated.
- Gunplay is very unrealistic and also illogical. Damage dealt is almost entirely unrelated to the power of the round or the place where someone got hit. Instead, some enemies have more or less health based on their role. 
- Ballistics are all off. Bulletdrop and ballistic effects have been dramaticly increased compared to what they would be IRL. The result is having to heavily correct your aim. Damage over distance is terrible and enemies beyond 100 meters need as many as 10-15 rounds even from full sized machineguns firing 7.92
- The AI is very poor.
- The game doesn't have the sandbox/skirmish mode for PvE, despite that having been a staple of Battlefield games.

This review covers singleplayer. I haven't gotten to multiplayer yet and with the way it's been going I'm not sure if I ever will.
This is my personal view on the game, as someone that cares a lot about historical accuracy, realism and immersion. If you enjoy more arcade style shooters, chances are you will like this game more than I did..

I got the game for 3 or 4 euro's on a sale. For that price, I guess I can't complain. But I can say I now fully understand why this game was so cheap despite being from 2018 and from a major game company. If you want to try this game, buy it during sale and expect to be disappointed."
Reinstalled can't open DUM DUM EA retard game
"got scammed by ea, ofc"
Can no longer play it on Linux.
"Review for SinglePlayer stories only:

Ridiculious, unauthentic, bad plot, lame character writing, ahistoric


Requested a refund."
Que jogo mais péssimo. Como é que uma franquia dessas conseguiu decair tanto.
"EA, you stupid Boyi, what the are you doing with the ban? I'm a newbie and I'll be sealed after playing the first one.,Are you a must-raise EA or aren't you? If you don't know how to do it, don't do it, and it is recommended to reopen."
game crashes every time I try to play it even at lowest settings trust me I played it 2 months ago in maxed settings it didnt even lag but now it just crashes and lags a lot
"This game is so bad rather play the new warzone than the ""Firestorm"""
"Daca as avea un dusman ,i as da gift acest joc.Muie EA"
"as fun as this game is, there's still way too many hackers running around ruining the fucking game"
Still waiting for a medic
"Dumbass game with a decent play style, though. Unreal stories, missing story parts of WWII, Cheaters won't get banned, and few servers are playable. Every time the game is on sale, a bunch of new idiots rush in so the veteran players can have their fun. It was great when the game was first published, and the DICE team was like they got brain cancer or something. They decided to make another shitty game BF2042, which I requested for a refund after 10 mins playtime. Respawn points are dumb as hell, either far away and become moving targets, either too close, or just respawn right on the enemy's face."
Nein
"it is quite buggy and some actions of NPC are very illogical that makes the whole experience very artificial.

Also no ukrainian translation is bit disappointing."
"Unfortunately I have to downvote this game and Valve itself. It is my first negative review as I usually consider the effort of the developers. But now...
They added a kernel level anti cheat program that I cannot agree to install for security concerns and this game is not launching anymore. Had I known before I would have never purchased the game. They just ignore my refund request.
Someone seems happy of the new anticheat but others like me are very unhappy of the unpleasant situation. When you deploy such an impactful change you should give your customer the right to choose if continue playing the game or receive a refund."
"Want to love it, but nah, Campaign is bad, Movement is bad, Plane's are actually unusable compared to like BF4, Unoptimized, Cheaters, Guns are not balanced at all, snipers are the only real usable weapon, Just generally janky and unfinished in the terms of everything really."
"The historical inaccuracies really pull you out of it and ruin the experience and atmosphere of the game. It's like if a game was set in Victorian London and someone pulled out a smartphone and asked you to text them. In short:

What this game needs is fewer women and more swastikas."
"Bullshit game. but the  last tiger is peak campaign. 

online is awful and unbalanced. snipers forces u to play sniper instead other roles. scks godzilla's  dck"
"If you're looking for multiplayer, just play BF1"
Inconsistent ttk and at least 1 cheater in every game.
"using cheats in this game is free , 90% of players are using cheats , dont waste yout time and your money on this shit game"
"poorly maintain, tons of hacker"
"Time to kill feels off, sometimes it's too fast, other times too slow. 
movement is also way too animated, makes it genuinely confusing to shoot at people sometimes.
You can go prone in a way that makes you look like a dead body.
Recoil impulse feels extremely cheap and flat, like it's the camera itself creating artificial recoil while your gun flimsily shakes around.
Map visibility is horrendously bad on most, and a bunch of them are also way too big with too many angles to look at. 
Player base is extremely demented and will either make you laugh or rage. 
Planes are really broken and have way too much HP so taking them down is a CHORE. 
The cosmetics are terrible for the most part, and are not restricted to classes, so you can make each one look identical. 
Gun distribution is a stupid mess, why are shotguns only on the support??
Tank controls are decent.
The whole gun specialisation system is neat, but half of the perks feel copy pasted and utterly uninspired and boring.
Game is missing multiple historic guns actually used in the war like the WZ.35 AT rifle, FB Vis.35, MP-41, M1891 Carcano, M1903 Springfield, Breda 30, Owen Gun, Nagant M1895, FN Browning 1900, Browning Hi-Power, M1917 Revolver, TT33 Tokarev, PPSh-43 and PPSh-41, Nambu Pistol, Lancaster SMG, Berthier Rifle, SVT-40, MAS-36 Rifle, Hamada Type-1, ZB wz.26, Mors vz.39, DP-28, M1941 Johnson LMG, basically zero Russian guns (I DO NOT care if Russia was never added as a faction, there is NO EXCUSE) and I probably missed a few more guns but you get the gist.

A lot of obscure and stupid prototypes like the Type 3A (named 2A for some reason) took priority over these historically used firearms, on top of the fact that the devs lazily recycled like 1/3 of the guns from BF1. 

So all in all what can I say uh..
Least the shotguns feel nice?

4/10
It just isn't a competent FPS, or a competent Battlefield title. 1 and previous titles are better, but this one is better than 2042 (lol)."
Woke bs
"very worst multiplayer mode...lot of cheaters ..fast running cheat, prefire cheat, aimbots , one shot cheat..etc"
"Disable the fucking planes
Sweats are camping them and as soon as you spawn as a plane or tank they spawnkill you"
Just really unfun
"Hackers every game, at least 1 every game. Story mode is lackluster. Chat spamming bots which EA will never do anything about."
"tiger in norway in 1940 xddd and this is only prologue, waiting for aliens or zombie naz*st"
"Multiplayer from what ive experienced is riddle with cheaters would not recommend, if you like story then i would recommend"
EA CONNECTION FAILED
Literally the worst BF game ever.
"Not a complete review, but f*ck this game. I didn't need to get far to see some telltale sins of game design. Needing yet another separate acct and client for EA was a bad sign, but other good games like RDR2 need that shit as well, so ok. The first campaign, the intro, gives a wonderful demo of just how awfully everything controls, from vehicles to the player. And then when the second episode starts, the cinematic BS (which I only tolerate in minimal doses anyway ... unless it's REALLY well done, which in this game, it's not particularly well done), during that cinematic BS, the graphics start stuttering and jumping around. My rig (Ryzen 9 5900, 64 GB RAM, RTX 4070 Ti Super 16GB VRAM ... that is not a setup that should have any difficulty) .... ok, fine, some graphics settings need tuning ... but can you escape to an options screen during the cinematic ... NO. No it won't let you. Piss off EA and piss off with your contempt for your audience. Uninstalling. Glad I only spent $5 on this POS."
"Battlefield 5 is a ""fun"" & ""forgiving"" experience compare to Battlefield 1, that is a true fact when it comes to multiplayer side of things.

But the campaign is by far, the most unfun, recycled to death experience I ever played. Stealth after stealth, open ended objectives after open ended objective, 2 levels are literally using the same format. Man do they forgot how to space out similar content.

Other than that, it is the most bland experience I ever had, there's nothing outstanding at all. I know WW2 was done to death at this point, so there's your bias. Except its not true. (COD: WaW campaign is still the most memorable experience, deal with it)


In short, Battlefield 5 has the most cut-n-dry experience I ever had, besides the more impressive Frostbite engine upgrade, its literally nothing outstanding at all. Let alone the character skin controversy, that's not the biggest issue here, as the issue being the gameplay that is dry as hell."
excessive foliage and bad map design makes me a vietnam war vet.
To many Women for WW2
Only if it's on sale.
"""WWII"" game with no USSR, soldier can survive a direct impact from a 250kg bomb on ""hardcore"" difficulty in the campaign. Typical EA trash."
It doesnt work on steam deck.
"Just.. awful. Buggy mess. Boring. I bought this during the super sale to revisit the campaign and having just finished BF1, which was absolutely incredible, to move to this.. I'm just confused. How could it have gone so wrong."
shtit
Its a disgrace to history and all the men that fought and died in World War Two. Its abandoned trash with a decent enough multiplayer to keep players playing. but apart from that its a burning pile of sh*t that bugs out every single second.
can’t play multiplayer
"With the amount of automatic rifles, and experimental weapons never used in combat, this game does not feel like a World War Two game whatsoever. With almost everyone playing as these almost Call Of Duty Warzone - like characters that do not fit the timeline or even the faction you are playing as, the game feels more like Fortnite. The ""Campaign"" consists of ""Go from Point A to Point B Stealthily"" for 2 hours. If you're looking for an accurate World War Two game, play a game like Hell Let Loose."
HORRIBLE GAME I CANT EVEN PLAY AND MAJORITY OF PEOPLE HAVE THE  SAME ISSUE IT CRASHES AFTER LAUNCH.FIX THIS FUYCKING GAME I HAVE TRIED ALL THE FIXES BUT DID NOT WORK.
"I can only speak for the single player, but that was just terrible. The actual gameplay is basically the same as it was in earlier games, but the characters and story are just awful. If it gets better in later parts I do not know but as far as I got they were just dull juvenile cliches. I prefer to play a game through before forming an opinion but honestly, I just couldn't be bothered."
This game is not even worth the 3 euros. I have played for 19 hours and the sheer amount of unrealism is massive. How can a living human being tank 5 50. cal rounds to the chest or a direct hit from a PIAT. You need to empty a half of your magazine to just kill one soldier. The only weapons that do damage are shotguns at close range or AT rifles and even from the AT rifles a soldier is able to tank 2 rounds to the leg. The weapons are like airsoft but weaker and the rest is what you would expect from a battlefield.
"As for Multiplayer, it has some good mechanics, and the graphics are nice. but the gunplay.......... its horrid. and dont get me started with getting constantly bombed by planes... i wish i could like this game but i really cannot reccomend it, its predecessor Battlefield 1 was leagues above this game and it feels like it was made with passion. this game feels like its just a shitty version of 1. The only good aspect is visuals."
this entire game is ether dying to recon sitting on the other side of the map or tanks on the other side of the map
"This game is one of the games that sits in the library not be played for weeks. I feel that a very specific type of person plays something like this, which is fine (however) most people that I know don't have fun... at all. The story is very compelling or interesting... I get that but if the story isn't the point the mechanics should be. The controls and handing are very very very slow and rough. It feels like the player isn't in full control and the WAR IN THE PACIFIC mode is one of the main reasons I bought this. However the lobbies are always empty. So this disappointed me very much, however it has some good qualities that players can enjoyed such as the scenery and 1940s vibe."
This game is very good in term of graphic and gameplay but there is one thing that i am always frustrated when i am playing this game there are to many hacker and i cant have fun
"Whew what a stinker over here.

For reference, I played this game after playing Battlefield 1.

The gamemodes

What is the difference between strategic conquest and tactical conquest? The game fails to explain this and lazily puts the same tutorial video on both. So far my guess is the map variety. Tactical conquest only has British vs German maps while Strategic conquest has that and USA vs Japan maps. Another difference I noticed is that strategic conquest has huge spacing in between objectives. Why is this the major difference between gamemodes? Wow, I really like getting sniped in the middle of nowhere before reaching the next objective. Oh- I should be in transport vehicles? Well then I really like getting blown up in the middle of nowhere while some guy roughly 100 kilometers away gets a quadruple kill.

The maps

The overall color palette is bright and colorful. Why is a video game about war bright and colorful? The maps in tactical conquest are more of the battlefield experience I am used to, but with a more linear approach to map design. All it takes is for someone to memorize all of the choke points in the map to farm kills. The map I probably hate the most is that one desert market map. This map is basically a TDM arena map but for 120 players where everyone gets funneled into a 10 v 10 experience.

The Censorship

This is something anyone can easily poke fun at- which is why I'll make this section brief. The in-game chat has a heavy filter that is inconsistent at best. For example, You can't say ""nazi"" even though the Gemrans in WWII were that but you can say ""grammar nazi"". Sometimes it bugs out and hides random words that aren't really offensive which makes team communication a chore.

Animations in general are sometimes weird an uncomfortable. I don't know how to put it, but it is like everything is unnatural stiff and rigid.

Fire just feels useless.

The community feels dead even though the servers are almost always full 24/7.

There are no moderators. As a result, actual hackers do get on to ruin everyone's day. For example, I hopped into a lobby and a hacker was spamming redeploy to everyone in the whole lobby. Battlefield 1 doesn't have this.

And finally, I just want to note how in the maps, the German symbols and the Japanese flag are incorrect.


On the bright side, plane fighting is pretty cool and shooting them out of the sky with tanks is quite enjoyable.

Anyways, I would recommend playing Battlefield 1 first so you have an enjoyable time before playing this hot mess."
Visual are not much different than Battlefield 1 and yet it run far worse even on lowest setting for GTX 1050. Meanwhile Battlefield 1 can run quite great on GTX1050 with good visual graphic.
"A sad affair indeed.

I mean, the game itself is AMAZING. The graphics are top notch, the mechanics are what I would expect from an online ""war type PvP game"", but sadly no one is online playing this game with a PC.

I did some research and it seems EA has taken NO STEPS to address the hacker community in this game.

Apparently this game is very vulnerable to hacking software and allows cheaters to simply ""one shot"" you from across the map.

I mean, it is a great strategy sure, and it works, but is not in the spirit of an online PvP match scenario. 

And if I may say this behavior is only prevalent in these types of games because of the monetization of streaming services that create followers through ""winners"".

These ""winners"" just hack to get their  rankings and then sell their stream to get ratings for cash.

Don't get me wrong, there are some real players out there, but they are far and few between.

A fair game is a fair game, but it seems hackers have decided to destroy that ideal because they have nothing better to do than to torment the players and the company until success is no longer an option; and they do it for profit.

Sad indeed.

But... C'est la vie.

I do not recommend this game as it is solely based on multiplayer mode and the online experience is just horrendous.

If a company is going to base their sole business model based on online play, I would have imagined they would have created a more fair playing field for their players.

What a failure.

I am so sad for this because the game is BEAUTIFUL.

It is just a tragedy that the world will not continue to enjoy it because the devs and the publishers were lackluster lazy fucks that didn't give a fuck about anything past their MTX and pre-purchase profit.

It's fucking laughable.

If you are going to play this game I recommend playing through a console (and turning off cross platform) based upon the lack of security there is in the PC version.

That is what I am doing."
"IT RESETS SETTINGS ON RESTART!

I absolutely did not expect such common mistakes from AAA studio with more than dosen of years of experience! It lunches with low resolution/frame rate on first start, doesn't allow to change graphics before some action starts (it also a very common mistake, it is not acceptable for a AAA shooter), and some options are requiring game to relaunch. And after relaunch, everything is reset to default!

I've completed the first action sequence and relaunched the game after, all of the settings were default and I HAD TO COMPLETE THE SEQUENCE AGAIN!

Absolute garbage user experience from veterans of the game industry, feels like i got spat in the face."
EA moment
"this shit suck,can't even go to the main menu."
game is fun but cheaters on almost every game
This game is turbo-ass. 0/10
Server connections are teriible and doesnt even come close to BF3
"I was surprised how many skill trees there were for guns and vehicles, BUT, the Asia region is filled with Chinese hackers. So the game is completely unplayable in that region"
it could be better...too many cheaters redeploying the server every few games
honestly pretty bad
"EA security is too broken, i wouldn't recommend"
"On PC alone I've clocked nearly 70 hours, and I bet my whole life that 20% of that entire playtime is trying to get this damn shitshow to even run. For fuck's sake EA you cant do a single thing right can you? not in BF1, 2042, or this bullshit"
horrible
"EA/Dice games are infested with Cheaters, the new EA anti cheat didn't do anything good except to ban the Linux platform. Ignore EA/Dice games if your looking to keep your sanity."
do not play this game
"does not look like trailer at all, not even close"
I really hate that I paid money for this
"Fortnite damage model. 7 shots with a 30-06 rifle to take someone down assuming they don't start jumping and powersliding around to dodge your bullets. Slow respawn times, your exact location shown to enemies even if you're behind cover, no chance to survive in any vehicle that isn't fully upgraded. Flares put you on the enemy's minimap even if you're underground, anti-tank weapons totally useless, reinforcements take the entire round to earn, mounted guns overheat in 15 shots. Footsteps are louder than a Tiger's engine. 200% ""hardcore"" servers fixed all of this, but nobody hosts those anymore.

EA+Dice have abandoned this game, only caring about nicking players for saying non-PC things in chat. Lax / Strict ping moderation removed from server operator's options so expect everyone to have 150ms+ latency."
"I dislike the volume of hackers.  its all aim-bots.  If i want to be fondled and assaulted, i can get that for free at the local park.  EA will never see another dime from me."
"TL;DR - Probably the worst Battlefield Game to date, fighting 2042 and Hardline for 1st. It sucks for old timer battlefield players. And if EA wanted to make an FPS to draw in players who'd never played FPS's before or were new in general, they failed. 

I've been a battlefield veteran for many years and Battlefield 4 was a game I enjoyed so much that I actually purchased it three times for each of the compatible systems I had for it (the PS3, the PS4 when I upgraded, and PC). I've been playing since Battlefield 2 and the franchise was very near and dear to my heart. Naturally when all of the dumb stuff EA was doing with the franchise came to a head in Battlefield V, I skipped it. I wasn't going to give it the time of day and everything I saw about reaffirmed that it wasn't going to be worth the cost of entry. Years later, however, with it on sale for three bucks and with the knowledge Battlefield games often take years to polish up, I decided to pick it up. And boy howdy, it's rough.

For starters all of the unrealistic aspects are here. The weapons aren't faction locked, women are just as numerous on the battlefield as the men, you can play things like a black women amongst the Germans (just lmao on that one), and that sort of thing. There's also a cosmetic system reminiscent of some of the more recent CoD and battle royal titles. These range from really interesting to 'meh' to absolutely goofy and immersion breaking. However if you're willing to let that slide... the fundamental moment to moment gameplay experience just isn't good.

I recall at the time that for reasons only known to God and EA they wanted to make a game that 'non FPS players would enjoy' looking specifically to female players. The way they chose to do this was by the cosmetic factors mentioned above and by hand crafting a tutorial that was somehow simultaneously handholdy and uninformative. They explain the concept of capture the flag and ticket counts no less than four times. Something that even nine year old me (who was NOT a very smart kid, mind you) was able to figure out through context clues. The tutorial is missing, however: vehicle driving, the ENTIRELY NEW TO BATTLEFIELD building mechanic, bullet drop, throwing back grenades, and all sorts of other things that someone brand new to FPS's would *actually* need help with. 

The rest of the gameplay continues the unhappy marriage of the alleged goal of attracting non FPS players and adhering to old battlefield fans. The Time to kill and bleedout timers are some of the lowest in the franchise and are incredibly punishing for newer players. Things like the passive resupply caches and other easy 'help the team and learn the game' items that would be useful for a less mechanically inclined player are just gone. Things that could have been added to help newer players like letting them crawl to a better spot to be revived or getting something of a kill cam (to explain how and why they were killed) are also not here. The maps feel absurdly small for Battlefield and WWII alike and considering half the assets in this game were blatantly ripped right out of Battlefield 1 you'd think they'd of borrowed some of the larger maps as well. As it stands you're often corralled into very narrow playspaces where newer players are chewed up and spit out on the regular. 

For the flip side for long standing battlefield players the lack of strategic choices in most maps is painfully obvious and there's very little in the way of interesting strategies as almost all of the classes have been filed down to have a large portion of their identity removed. Anti-tank weapons are largely ineffective and the battlefield is dominated by a handful of select weapons so progression is simply not all that present especially since the game tends to come with the 'starter packs' now. Weapon selection is very small despite weapons not being locked to faction. Many of the additional gadgets and gizmos aren't all that interesting either with staples of the franchise that were carried over into 1 just being missing. Entire factions are missing even years later. The Russians aren't here. The French aren't here. The Italians aren't here. It's USA, Germany, Japan, and the UK. That's it. It's honestly kind of embarrassing, especially with the wide derth of peoples and factions represented in battlefield 1 even on release. This is the most content light battlefield to date and you can feel that in every menu.

So. EA managed to craft an experience that drove most of your old school battlefield players away and ended up unironically harsher for new players to learn than previous title entries because EA seems to think the way to encourage first time FPS'ers is to explain simple concepts like they might be developmentally disabled and then not explain anything else. So whats the remaining community like? A bunch of whiny, constantly crying about ""hackers"" salty toxic ingrates who spend more time throwing slurs in chat than they do playing the game. There is no team balancing. Matches are universally one sided stomps across the board, and there's more salt in your average /all chat per match than an actual salt quarry in Utah. 


It's sad. Really. Had this had an actually competent leadership team behind it who were willing to let the devs work, had the lead devs not been ideologically poisoned against their own franchise's history, if EA could not be EA for a grand total of 12 minutes, this could have been a great game. This could have gone down in history as one of the best multiplayer WWII games on the market. Hell, it could have been great for new battlefield players and new FPS players as well if they actually sat down and thought about what players new to FPS's might actually need instead of taking wild potshot guesses that anyone with an IQ above seven should have recognized as stupid. Instead, it goes down as one of the final death knells of a once beloved franchise. Do not buy this game. Not even for three dollars. If you were to take those three dollars and buy nothing but gumballs to lodge in your rectum, it'll be money better spent.  Go buy an older entry in the series, or find another WWII game on the market. There's plenty and MOST outshine what this is."
this game is trash got it for 4 dollars and still wanna refund its buggy the story mode is so bad like this is a lazy failed cash grab
fix your game
"Hideous mouse feel, I find it nearly impossible to aim. Mouse settings and raw input on make no difference. The mouse feels filtered and laggy to kingdom come and back, I simply cannot aim at all and I play dozens of other shooters where I don't feel that issue."

the game is completliy dead it said 17k people playing but i played 71mins not even 1 match played"
Garbage game loaded with cheaters
"battlefield 1 is better, target recognition in 5 is so hard and i was dying too many times and without seeing where i was getting shot from, and yes i am a seasoned and experienced bf player, 200+ hours in bf1"
Trash
Don't waste the time it takes to download it.
Game launcher bugged and resets my progress each time i launch the game. After trying everything it nothing works. EA deserves their downfall
Dogshit game
"The TTK of this game is so off that everything that isn't a high firerate SMG or a splash damage shell from a tank or plane just isn't worth using. Somehow this also includes all LMGs which they inexplicably gave maximum magazines of 50 or less. Do NOT buy this game, you could just be playing Battlefield One, Bf4 or even Bf3 instead which are just better games unfortunately."
"Game is fine, sadly the community is cheating for MP.  From clip shot kills to tag headshot kills.  The game has about 9 out of 10 players cheating and those that aren't are getting slammed.  EA did a study and found 65% are cheating on all there MP games.  Sadly Microsoft is a big part of the blame with Directx holes still never patched for over 30 years now.  Unless you want to play the boring single player it's waste of funds, I'd try BF4 for the single player and BF1 well it's full of same cheating.  Otherwise game on elsewhere."
"Kernel level anti-cheat does absolute jackshit. Even when it works normally about 70% of the maps are terrible 

Just buy BF1"
"im using ReWASD tool for my games who didn't support controller and this stupid game didn't want to get launched and it ask me to close the tool if i have to play it so closed the reWASD tool and tried to start the game and then it asked me to restart my PC...GUYS DO DONT BUY THIS TRASH GAME, I HAVE MANY GAMES AND I NEVER GOT THIS STUPID ERROR BUT ONLY FROM THOSE BASTARDS WHO THINK THEY CAN LET ME DELET MY TOOL TO PLAY THEIR TRASH SHOOTER GAME...IN YOUR DREAM"
"I would've given this a middle rating if I could because the campaign is absolute dogshit, but can be pretty fun. I waited an entire night for this game to download, and when i got to play it this morning, i was bamboozled to find out that, even on easy mode, you take a shit ton of damage, and on top of that, the stealth mechanics are janky as fuck. Plus, the destruction mechanics are worse than in BF1, which came out 2 years prior to this, and they reused so many things from BF1 anyway, making it worse. This game is literally the Halo 5 of Battlefield."
"schlechtes gameplay, schlechte team8s noch schlechtere wafen mechanics"
it is a good game but the pacing is horrendes feels like call of duty.
i cant even play the god damn game
"Garbage publisher that publishes breaking changes. Does not work anymore, go to hell thieving EA."
I hope to never play such a garbage game where apparently enemy has all the better items than you.
"As much as I tried liking this game,it just didn't feel right to me,maybe I'm not into Battlefield and I'd much rather prefer Call of Duty,but this one seriously lacks quality and it's most evident in its single-player ""campaign"" broke down into 4 different War Stories that are each worse than the other with the exception of The Last Tiger which is the better of the bunch,but far from a stellar experience.Ironic that the only ""good"" campaign has you play as the Axis.Awful stories aside,the gameplay isn't any better as you have generic objectives to complete and ""stealth"" your way to them in the most bs way I've ever seen,with enemies seeing you from a mile away and guys operating turrets that won't fucking die.The campaigns in general are basically glorified tutorials that unfortunately reminded me of that horrible BF2 campaign,which is honestly better than this piece of crap,As for the multiplayer,I haven't seen so many campers in a game since MW2 and hackers run rampant destroying any last piece of hope I had for this.It may be fun ocasionally,but as a whole I wouldn't recommend touching this unless you are a die-hard fan of WW2 or don't want to spend a whole bunch on a game,but only on sale as it's just not worth the hassle to pay full price for this dissapointment. 5/10"
👎
"Cool game, really polished decently toward the end of its life, with a decent amount of content. I MIGHT recommend getting it if it is on discount, and if you're a fan of Battlefield and WWII stuff, but I can't. This is for the sole reason that there are cheaters/hackers/aim-botters whatever you want to call them, in their servers. Nothing at all makes playing a competitive game online worth it when dealing with literal cheaters. I had heard that this was an issue for ages in the PC community, but thought that DICE/EA had implemented some sort of anti-cheat that worked."
"I cannot run the game at all. Tried so many things
- Set compatibility mode and display
- Remove BFV from registry editor and reinstall it
- Uninstall and install EA App and BFV
- Delete the environment variables that has ""GAME ID"" or something

PS: I just bought my laptop. i didnt install any malicious software whatsoever."
"cheaters, out of the mind teammates. Battlefield 1 is better."
"Online - to many sweats
Story - bad telling, i set it on ""easy mode"" cant get past one damn level without dying multiple times 

1/10 game"
Battlefield 1 does almost everything pretty much better than this
"this game is full of bugs, you can't save the progress. I wasted 3 hours. The sniper 4 and 5 are much better. Don't waste your money on this."
"Invest in good anti-cheat that doesn't block Linux players, but I guess that's what greed leads to."
FIX YOUR GAME
bleh
"If, like me, you wanted to pick this up for 3.99 just to play the singleplayer campaign, don't bother. it's just, just awful. All I can say is, it is very clear that they did not make this game with single player in mind at all, which I figured. Still, for 3.99 I thought it might be worth it. It's just not, it's not worth it for free, it's a waste of your time and hard drive space, and it makes you install EA crap. There is clearly TONS more time and effort put into the short cutscenes between the missions than the missions themselves. Use that 3.99 and buy some cheap vodka, then drink it with your cat. That will be infinitely more engaging."
its a battlefield my main compliant is with the planes its very shaky and i think its cool it adds a lot of action but i can barely see anything when im turning the ground game play is okay its not the best no weapons are beginner friendly having high recoil the only weapons with okay recoil suck and the tank game play is okay and if you go against a tank you are most likely screwed tanks are so broken if left with nothing to counter it and if there is its not reliable the assault class is okay the panzerfaust has only two rounds and you gotta hit the tank in the right location to actually deal damage the dynamyte is better against people and the cqb combat is aids anyone with a shotgun wins if they have good aim and if they can even use the weapons due to the recoil overall 3/10 game would not recommend this game is only for people who hate themselves.(battlefield 4 is way better)
piece of shit
Total shit
"Unpolished - not worth the frustration even if it is free with crashing, bugs/exploits that are left unpatched, and cheaters.

EA app is also broken.  Logs out constantly, but also says youre disconnected when you are logged in and doesnt let you actually play the game you paid for. EA should be ashamed of releasing garbage like this"

"An okay game, sucks when there's campers with flamethrowers. Also fuck you Ea, Their launcher is so shit and even with a decent pc the game always crash or don't want to open certain days."
There's no way in hell this thing came after BF1. The gameplay feels and handles like shit. I really wish i could get my money back
Its shit
"no custom emblems, feels like a call of duty game and is full of cheaters (the game doesnt even need an anticheat software, all they had to do was support community servers with moderators and 3rd party plugins but i guess using the server browser was too complicated for normies) but i still wouldnt call it a bad game, and ill probably keep playing it. if youre planning to buy only one battlefield game buy bf1, otherwise buy them all, they are all dirt cheap.

also the singleplayer campaign sucks ass but who cares about the campaign in a bf game anyway

"Take Battlefield 1 and everything that makes it great...

And now, throw Battlefield 1 away.
WW2 setting, and press publish.


There are literal hundreds of people i've seen running around with very modern-looking skins, and literal holographic sights...
In this W O R L D. W A R. 2 GAME... (That is literally the time setting meant and advertised for this)
 Real EA/DICE talent everyone!

Racial slurs are exchanged like pokemon cards
People using cheats aren't even subtle about it anymore


Yeah, it's not burning garbage for a shooter game (only regular garbage)
But there SURELY is a specifific reason why this is in WW2, no?...

the ONLY redeeming thing about this is that one campaign ""The last tiger"" that seems to have had way less control from the power-drunk people at the top and given an actual glimpse at how much the devs have just been chained to their desks for the rest of the game's content"
"i paid 3.5$ for this and i wish i could get a refund  , if you play this game you have brain damage or have no idea what playing a multiplayer FPS Battlefield  game should look like"
Real Battlefield experience with bunch of retards.
so many cheaters
"Revisiting the game with more powerful hardware to enjoy its advanced effects did not age will. It uses the first gen DLSS which is quite awful. RTX makes the game hang several times, even after caching all shaders it still hangs. Dx11 remains the best way to play it, which my decade old PC could also do comfortably. I wonder if all RTX games will age similarly."
Too may cheaters. and hit detection is terrible.
horrible stealth
i will sue ur ass lil bro and u will be hearing from my lawyer ahh karen
"Ea - компания жадных пидарасов и умственно отсталых ослоебов, которые ебутся в жопу на своей работе. Другого объяснения нет  их всему похуизму на игры и нормальное предоставления услуг."
The only thing good about this game is they advocate sending women to the frontlines
The game was pretty playable until a few years ago. Now it is full of hackers and EA is doing nothing to fix it
"EA games launcher + one of the most terrible shooter

"here is where id put my battlefield 5 game timmy 


IF IT WOULDNT CRASH"
Bad game
"world of tanks- that spawn kill

going back to battlefield 1"
cheater has alot of and anti cheate like fucking dick
I reinstalled this after seeing a friend playing it but I didn't get five minutes in before remembering it was BFV before I uninstalled it
"I actually like battlefield somewhat - > good graphics, gameplay is not too shabby (alltough its going the direction of COD)

BUT why i dont recommend it?: - >

hackers

redirect scam to Origin

lags even with 7ms

political agenda in-game

damage + spawn system actually shitty"
Despite of annoying Vaginal noises and all Virtuous contravercy.. Yes this game is still a downgrade from Battlefield 1. It shows how much more impactful competent sound director is. Skip
Game is good But anti-cheating is poor. How is funny with stay stand and head shot behind the wall?
"terribly optimized, pc literally built to run bf5 can't run it without fps issues on minimum graphics settings"
Micro Transactions? Yes. EA's MicroPenis? also yes
"It crashes after 5-15 minutes and sometimes i cant even come into the start menu

Pls fix your game"
its the worst game ive ever played the maps are to big its not 3 lane and its so sweaty its basicly bo6 just that everyone snipes you and the enemies are basicly invisble untill you see a sniper scope then your dead you respawn and get spawn camped the game is awful fuck you battlefield
"You dont get Company Credits for leveling up so you cant upgrade your guns, its some sort of bug...sad for a 2018 game."
no
EA
too many cheaters in game
govno
it's shit
Shame that newer game is such a step down from the old one (BF1).
ZRBAAA
Bf4 > this
always lost connect haiya
"Jesus Christ EA....What the hell.  I know no one who matters will ever read this.  But please just try to give a damn about a modicum of historical accuracy.  I bought this on the steam sale for like $5 and I could hardly make it thru the opening.  Insufferable inaccuracies, and it looks like I play as an actual Nazi at one point?  I didn't sign up for that.  
Do yourself a favor.  Skip this game.  Punch a Nazi.  Buy a Coke."
I can't recommend it - waaaay too many blatant cheaters. It's a shame that the game has never lived up to its full potential. EA won't fix or update it; they are too busy with DEI slops nowadays.
"kernel level anti cheat for single player
Nope"
I forgot I even had this game... and hated it!
pile of hot steamy dogshit

A lot of bugs
Ca rap
"[h1] Battlefield V: EA's Masterpiece of Chaos and Regret [/h1]

Battlefield V feels less like a game and more like a social experiment to see how much frustration you can handle before uninstalling. Buckle up it’s going to be a bumpy ride.

Performance: A Battlefield Against Frame Drops
The frame drops in this game hit harder than any in-game explosion. One second you’re lining up the perfect headshot, and the next, your screen freezes just long enough for someone named “xXSniperGod420Xx” to ruin your day. And don't even get me started on the RTX-DLSS debacle. Apparently, you can’t enjoy both, because EA said so.

Graphics: Pretty, But Make It Weird
The visuals can be breathtaking until they’re not. The lighting sometimes gives you war movie vibes, but then you notice a rock texture that looks like it was borrowed from 2009. It's like the developers got tired halfway through and said, “Yeah, that’s good enough.”

Glitches That Would Make a Beta Tester Cry
Glitches are where this game truly shines. Vehicles get stuck in mid-air, players do the moonwalk after dying, and once, I saw a tank flying over a mountain like it was auditioning for Top Gun. Immersion? Absolutely shattered. Entertainment? 10/10.

Oh Boy, EA Anti-Cheat!
And now, let’s talk about EA’s pièce de résistance: the anti-cheat system. Not only does it occasionally work, but it also sneakily installs itself as a driver and starts taking screenshots of your gameplay like some sort of digital stalker. Because nothing says “fair play” like an anti-cheat system that feels more invasive than a tax audit.

EA Software: The Cherry on Top
Let’s not forget the masterpiece that is EA’s launcher and support software. It’s slow, clunky, and somehow manages to make you miss the simplicity of discs. Pair that with their anti-cheat, and you’ve got the perfect recipe for regret.

Why I Refunded It
I refunded the game right after I got sniped by a guy swimming through a wall, moments before my tank spontaneously exploded because it hit an invisible pebble. Honestly, it felt like the game was trying to refund me.

Final Thoughts
Battlefield V has its moments of brilliance buried under mountains of bugs, bad optimization, and EA’s overreach with their software. If frustration and anti-cheat drivers installing themselves uninvited sound like your thing, this might just be the game for you. Otherwise, I’d recommend saving your sanity and maybe playing Free Fire instead.

Thanks, EA, for the unforgettable experience. 💩"
so bad
cheaters
Just play Battlefield 1
i can't even play because of ea anticheat shenanigans lol nice uninstall simulator
"completely unbalanced where the defenders always win, SMG's can kill you in 1-2 shots from 70m out, and everything is so completely overexposed you cannot see a single thing but white. it is so obvious they do not give a shit about this game"
"Cinematic's jittery, runs at 30 for a 2018 AAA unbelievable, game puts motion blur back had to change it 5 times in less than 5 minutes."
does not launch keeps crashing
"This game is ****ing booboo literally every EA battlefield and battlefront game is exactly the same just reskinned  

THANK **** I GOT IT FOR $3"
"What would have been a great game. The devs and especially the music composer Johan Söderqvist did an exceptional job. One of the best soundtracks in gaming. But the people in the management had to ruin a perfect game.
Worth buying on the lowest price if you want to play the campaign. But multiplayer is a lost cause. Riddled with cheaters."
login ea app sangat mengganggu dan membuat gamenya crash karena login crash!!!!!!!!!
"Probably the worst Battlefield ever, worse than 2042. Itwalways feels like you die from their first bullet. Fuck this new DICE developers. They suck."
Step 1: Don't buy this game.
i dont like it
Full of hackers. Servers crash very often
EA
I really enjoy watching the animation like 2 times in row after i need to respawn -.- Little bit better than BF1 but still dogsh!t
DONT BUY THIS GAME SO MANY CHEATER :)
too many wall hack users
I love this game but the hacker ruin it
unfortunately 0 autobalance in the game so atleast 90% of the games one of the team i just losing big time and everyone is leaving. Also you can't report anyone for harassment resulting in an even more toxic community then cod... Not what it used to be unfortunatly
its ass
campaign was good but multiplayer was trash
Mal optimizado y el pvp no tiene balance. El BF1 es mejor.
"Loved battlefield 1 as a kid but coming into this one late I am slaughtered by level 300 planes constantly I refuse to be meat. it asked me to revise my review i will. i played this more until i died and waited out an entire game with my character stuck between dead and alive no way of reviving for 10 minutes
dog shit game fuck EA"
game is very badly optimised
"EA forces you to install its shitty launcher even after owning the game on Steam, the launcher decided to brick itself one day and the game doesn't launch anymore. Thanks EA.

Edit: Had to reinstall Windows OS to make it work again, the game works now, but the review shall still be negative."
Bought it in sale for the single player War Stories. No good if most of the times the EA launcher won't work.
"It has an Origin launcher, which prevents this game(and others on a platform) from running half of the time. To fix the problem you have to restart the PC, EVERY SINGLE TIME."
game so bad  4080 gpu  laging video realoud  fps dropping
"There is zero reason why I average 30ish kills and 10 deaths in BF1 but almost always end a match of BFV with 5ish kills and 20 deaths other than actual foul play.
This game's cheating problem is absolutely rampant. Zero moderation on """"""community"""""" servers, easy anti-cheat slapped on like a bandaid over a gaping wound, and no support from EA on the matter as this game is dead and done with.

This game is both a waste of time and money, both better spent on games like Battlefield 1."
"Every game has a cheater or hacker with aim bots and speed hacks.

Attempting to join a server will often lead to you being put in an empty lobby, or failing to join the game, or the game crashing while you're joining.

Spent more time attempting to join lobbies or being on the deploy map screen after being alive for .2 seconds than I did actually playing the game"
"Tried to play 10 matches. 4 had cheaters getting 80-0 from planes, 4 had disconnects, and 2 were actually fun. Was fun until is wasn't."
"Bad gamedesign 
Bad artdirection 
Bad gunplay"
"I want a refund, Hackers in every single game make it unplayable!!!"
fckin hackers in every game
"Feels boring compared to BF1. The maps aren't as well planned out as in BF1 so there's more running around, looking for enemies which is what I would expect when I play realistic shooters but not Battlefield. Starting to regret I bought this."
"This game is nice but there's just too many china cheaters, most of the cheaters were Chinese and they spam china websites so don't ask why am I targeting on china only, because those cheats were made from china, and also Taiwan is a country because according to the law, if a state that has its own military, currency, government will be count as a country nor a state."
"I’ve tried to like this game for a long time now, but I just can’t get over how lazy the game design feels. The gunplay doesn’t even come close to what we had before with Battlefield 1, and it’s just a bad Battlefield game overall. Sorry, I’ve tried, but I guess I’ll have to play something else."
Unplayable. Unbalanced. My eyes hurt.
not even worth the campaign for 3€..
wassnt worth 2$
"These use to have better single player story lines, now they are kinda of choppy. Its super focused on the multiplayer, they might as well only do that at this in the franchise."
worst game. game helps pros. dont buy
I came back to this BF as it was so good before. Now its just full of hackers/cheats with blatant 100/0 k/d. They sit in a plane all game hitting target every single time. another game spoilt by cheats in every server.
Hate from the west midlands
"First time entered the game, it freezes every 5 seconds. Changed the graphics to all low, still freezes every 5 seconds. Tried verified the game files, but EA Launcher wont let me in the game after that. Same problem with Need For Speed Heat. You need to verify here then restart EA launcher, etc etc then you can launch the game and pray you can play. Why cant we just use Steam, JUST STEAM to launch the game? Its unplayable and a waste of 90 gb download. I'm gonna keep it for collection though. I bought it cheap anyway."
"It s stuck, I cannot enter the single play. Keep loading and nothing happen"
Steam deck (steamOS) not supported. thanks EA.
"This game went on sale for under $10.

Aimbots are free. Let fire ants rip apart your sack if you're into self-flagellation. It'd be a better deal."
Played Battlefield 1 and loved it then decided to buy this one because I thought it was gonna be like Bf1 but this one is TRASH
HACKERS ARE PRESENT IN SOME MATCHES. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.
fuking anty cheat
Getting shot in the back simulator
genuinely the worst battlefield i have ever played... just buy battlefield 1 if you want a battlefield game that's fun and isn't masochistic in game play...
thx for showing me unskippable intro cutscenes twice
"After playing this game for about a year, this is all im gonna say.

[spoiler] [h2] TOO. MANY. CHEATERS. [/h2] [/spoiler]

When i first started playing this game, there were a decent amount of cheaters. Sure, there werent any anti-cheat or lack thereof back then, and this game is the only game i can have fun on, so i have to get used to it.

When EA announced that they're gonna put EA anti-cheat on the game, i was hopeful. 2 months after the anti-cheat update, there was more cheaters before the anti-cheat update. Now i will guaranteed to encounter an instakill aimbot or redeploying cheat every day i play. At this point, i was done with the game.

[b] It was a good run while it lasts. [/b]"
"Looks worse than bf1.
Feels worse than bf1.
Plays worse than bf1.
Worst UI I have ever used.
Worst progression I have ever experienced.
Everyone is dressed like they are in Star Wars or an action movie protagonist.
Sounds better than bf1.

Dice will never make a good game again, they don't have it in them."
I'd rather buy winrar.
"same as battlefront 2 just a WW2 skin, straight garbage."
story mode bugs :thumbs_down:
"This game is so unbelievably laggy in multiplayer that I could not in good conscience suggest this to another human being. I would rather sit through a microbiology lecture for the next 5 hours and then finish off an 8 hour day with a 3 hour gender studies lecture. Do not buy this game if you enjoy multiplayer experiences, you will get none that are enjoyable."
Nerf tanks and planes
Another WW2 game zzzzzzz
"In multiplayer mode you are just joining the heavily losing side mid battle. The maps are big so everyone is just sniping from a distance, shooting from tanks from a distance. 
The single player stories are incredibly ahistorical and obviously written to suit modern politics. 
Everyone is running around with automatic guns with laser sights, weapons from any side eg japanese all running around with laser sight stgs. It doesn't respect WW2 history in the slightest. Why bother doing a WW2 game if you're not going to adhere to its history? 
I'm glad I only got this game severely discounted."
incredibly unbalanced
"Plagues with hackers, Specially in South Asian Server, even roblox anticheat  is better than whatever this has. If you are from south asia, don't even bother buying this game"
This game is straight garbage.
"The most DOG SH** PC Port I've ever seen in my life.

If you play this game on an HDR display in full screen, get ready for a seizure of a life time bro.

If you want to play with a controller, get ready for a 720 noscope kind of gameplay by just slightly moving the joystick.

If you own an AMD gpu, good luck. That's all I can say brother."
....
"Team stacking seems to be a much larger problem than in BF 1 or BF 2042. Every second game gets ruined by this.

Sliding makes this game feel kinda clownish, but wcyd. The movement in general is much worse than in BF 1.

Using planes vs ground targets doesn't require any skill (due to rockets, and the fact that fighter guns do splash damage). Furthermore the existence of rockets, fighter planes can even heads-on kill an AA gun, they simply just out-damage it from the far. This means no skill or situational awareness is required from the pilot. Farming ground targets is therefore embarissingly easy and does not add any value to the game."
"My whole playertime was spent on logging in and out of the game trying to prevent the game from breaking my whole audio output, took me extra hour or two to change half the window audio settings,troubleshooting. Game just decides to shit itself by going mute then breaking whole audio on entire PC unless you shut off the game. Turns out its not an unique experience when i read dozens of forums of people having the same exact issue, EA is ran by money driven troglodytes. Sadly unfixable problem for many"
shit game
Too many cheater.
EA bad
BF1 > BF5
The online mode is way too sweaty and there's no storyline.
"The graphics of this game are beautiful, really well done and immersive.

That about sums up the good portions of the game.  I really REALLY wanted to like it.  My first foray into WWII shooters were MoH, Spearhead and CoD2.  This is not those games.

Every bullet flies like you're using a paintball gun.  Horrible physics, you'll be point blank aiming at the chest of an enemy standing in front of you and the bullet goes through them like they aren't there.

I have zero desire to compete against other people.  I don't need to achieve victory over others to make myself feel better about my own life.  Why is there no bot support for anything except practice range and missions?  Missed opportunity.

For the $3.49 I paid, I still feel overcharged."
corporate slop; doesnt even come close to bf1.
The game won't even start. F**k EA
shit
"a lot of hacker , why don't want to add AI mode in 64 match ? mission only can play 4 player , also is not fair 20 vs 4 ?"
eh
"I really enjoyed this game for many years on many different consoles and PC, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!! not for $60 not for $50, $30, $20, $10, hell don't even download it if they make it free I have played the past 3 nights in a row and every single server i was in got ddos by hackers and crashed. this game is unplayable."
"can't believe i bought this trash, all EA games are trash.
Give me back my money, boycott EA. They only know how to take your money"
"bf5 felt like a worse bf1. i consider bf1 as the golden standard, and this game fails to even be in the same league as that game. Operators, elites, skins... on the multiplayer front this game is less a war game and more a call of duty arcade-ish game. compared to bf1, where soldiers feel like actual soldiers with a story and a life, these guys feel like eternally respawning characters with little to no personality.

The singleplayer campaigns are ass (yet again, compared to bf1), the story is less consistent and certain elements have no right to exist (actual example: in the Tirailleur campaign, the mc's friend ""sacrifices"" himself by blocking the hatch to a tank after throwing a grenade inside in order to not let the guys inside escape, yet a few seconds earlier, he shoots a guy who was trying to peek out of the tank. Why couldn't he do the same again? Why is the mc suddenly fine after having to be dragged seconds earlier? Also, the whole reason for the campaign is because the mc turns war into a fight against racism. Maybe the guys in ww2 actually did that, but i feel that this is completely unnecessary and should not exist).

Overall, this game is good, but not nearly as good as it should've been. 6/10, would probably play for another 40-50 hours before uninstalling to get enough space for baldur's gate 3."
"Made by mentally ill people taking more offense to symbols than the horrors of war

Also gameplay is ass if you don't go to hardcore servers

Only buy if -90% off"
hackers ahh game
"It's a good game, but much better on console. On the PC version there is too many controls to press and aiming is near impossible (might be because I have nerve damage in my right hand, but I do much better in other shooters). The guns suck ass though, a bolt action rifle takes 2 shots? By the time the you shoot the second shot off, you have been mowed down by someone with an MG or SMG. It's much better in battlefield 1 as it's practically 1 shot, 1 kill for the snipers rifle."
STUP1D A33 GAME MESSED UP MY HDR SETTINGS CANT EVEN FIX THIS SH1T EA GO SUCK A B1G C0CK U BUNCH OF L0SERS WHAT ARE YALL DOING ALL DAY JUST MESSING UP OUR SETTINGS GO EAT YOUR DUMB A33 GAME C0CK SUCKERS
Why does this have so many non-skipable cut scenes? The story is stupid just let us play the game.
This game is a sweatfest. Some guy with 5000 hrs will get in a tank or plane and cheese his way to 75 kills.
"The game is ok, but the fucking EA app is extremally shit"
"EAC trojan horse in the kernel. mark my words its a huge security risk, someone will figure out how to use eac kernel level to gain administrative rights to yours system."
Very sweaty when i am just trying to relax
ALDRI MER DRIT KJEDELIG
"To be honest i really liked the idea of battle field in general. But for me battlefield 1942 was where is stopped playing. I wasn't expecting super realism or much historical accuracy. I'm a fan of having rare weapons such as prototype weapons and weapons that didn't see much use on the front but were at least made in that period that adds a sort of diversity. The game focuses on semi-automatic and full automatic weaponry, but in a match i saw 2 to 3 bolt action rifles and the rest were assault rifles. on top of that the weapons themselves have no faction limits apparently the British forces can all be equipped with mp 40 smgs as if they were standard issue. The character customization was another downside for me, the ""cosmetics"" were unrecognizable to as i know the clothing item by name and camo type. no camouflage names no real uniforms used by the German army and they had a random name like the ""aristocrat"".  They had to push political agendas with adding female characters, all i heard on the battlefield TM were women screaming it felt like i was in a bloody maternity clinic. Some of the characters look like they came from the madmax universe. Helmets have no name like M35 Stahlhelm or M1 helmet. Some of the British camo patterns were not even real. there is a skin with a woman wearing a gas-mask from the cold war! It feels like it takes a whole mag to kill an opponent. Vehicle wise its pretty OK.
The Graphics are nice, for example the mountains in the fjell map. I am all for adding a few maps that haven't been covered in history or maps where battles didn't happen but just make the game labeled as alt history. I didn't like the way they put this game together i give it an overall 3/10"
"This game is not like I thought, high pc requirements, i does not run smoothly, bf1 is much better."
Funny how Battlefield 1 is what bfV wanted to be lol
"After the last time I played this game, quite a bit of time passed. I went from Xbox to PC and have been wanting to get this game again for all this time. The game is beautiful. Mechanics are great as always. However, there is one thing that absolutely ruins the game for me and that thing is the abundance of hackers; I spent most of my time setting up my classes and vehicles, only to go into a public match right afterwards. I am not exaggerating when I say this match was getting bent over and f--ked from behind. Hackers in the enemy team, killing everyone from places that you would never hit in vanilla BFV. It instantly turned me off from the game and I have already submitted a refund request."
"I haven't played BF since BF"", so after all these years and the sale on, I thought I would give it a go. I cannot believe that I finally bought BFV and found it to be the most frustrating POS I've played. 

Start the game, and you are treated to a loooooong  interactive introduction. You fight for a bit, then you die. Then it loads you somewhere else, you fight and die, then it loads you somewhere else, rinse repeat. after the 5th time, I just switched my TV off, and had a cup of tea. Sometime later I turn my TV back on, and the intro seems to have finally finished. I don't know how long the intro should be, but I reckon 30 mins should be enough for it to fully finish.

I finally get into a multiplayer conquest game. Took a few mins to start. Then after 90 seconds of battle time, the screen faded to black to inform me that someone else is joining our squad. In the middle of a firefight.

Put simply, The game states that I have currently 1.1 hours of play time. In reality, its been little over 2 minutes of actual gameplay.

EDIT: I tried the solo, and the solo missions are extremely linear. Too much cinema, hardly any gameplay. May as well be point-&-click. I closed the game as soon as I was arbitrarily blown up for the story.

In Summary, this is probably the most redundant review for the game, because I struggled to even get to the ""play"" part of the game.

I won't be wasting my time with this again, a few euros down the toilet as a lesson and promptly uninstalled.

I'll see what CoD is like.

Just. Let. Us. Play."
"Straight up cant play this game, and now BF1 because the the anti-cheat wont work without maybe wiping my OS and starting with a new one JUST TO CONTINUE TO DEAL WITH HACKERS STILL! Wont be buying bf 2042 till this is fixed by EA because it isn't worth my time to redo my PC`s OS just because 2 or 3 games don't work. Lol ill just play BattleBit or halo then. Dont get me wont i LOVE both these games but now i just cant play them. Why buy the new one if i dont know if it`ll suffer the same issue"
meh
"waited a few hours waiting for it to download, got through the intro only for it to crash"
"Sorry, but I'm struggling to see why anyone likes this game and generally hate BF2042. BF2042 is graphically and mechanically better, and not as dead. 

In terms of WW2 shooters, this pales in comparison to HLL. But I wanted something more casual. Sadly I was disappointed. It hasn't aged anywhere near as well as people say."
"This is seriously one of the worst games I've ever played. To whoever said this is ""good now"", it isn't.

Stop telling EA you want the next battlefield to be more like this. BF4 or BF1 are much better this. This game is not worth even the 3.50 it goes for on sale. Pick up Battlefield 1 for 2 dollars and have a much better experience."
this game is unplayable on non-hardcore servers
SHIT CHEATER GAME
leeeeee
"Ive been playing BF campaigns in order, and this one is by far the least optimized. The short story is just ""good guy kill nazi WITH explosions!"" I cant recommend this game unless its on 90% sale"
"this game has been out for so long yet the campaign is still slightly buggy and choppy cutscenes, campaign story and gameplay was meh... lotsa stealth mission like as it was discounted Metal Gear Solid.

Such a fall from grace from BF1 masterpiece, everything that BF1 was is definitely not here"
"Everyone's a sweat which ruin's the fun of the game, doesn't matter how good your internet is because you will always have issues like inability to reload, swap guns, MOVE, frame drops etc

The people that play this game truly bring the meaning of ""Hell on earth"" into full effect in the worse way possible as you WILL NOT have fun playing this game with them

Avoid at all cost"
"Probably one of the best looking WW2 games ive ever seen, but thats about all it has going for it. Loadouts are pretty unbalanced with 2/3 of the arsenal being useless (Weapon balancing it dreaful). The servers seem okay. Ping isn't as much of an issue as it once was. Sadly Cheaters have taken over the game with zero reprocussion. Reports go unchecked and they run rampant on Conq/TDM. 

*You Can Paint A Turd But It's Still A Turd*"
Had to buy the game on this account because EA took the game off my main and told me they can't reinstate it because it's a bug.... 3/10
The biggest Bruhh... full of Asian hacking kids.. EA and Dice wtf are you doing??
"Nice graphics but shit mechanics and progression for weapons!!!
All predecessors are better!"
"LOT OF CHEATER, EA DIDN'T DO ANYTHING FOR THAT."
"This is probably the worst modern gaming experience, it is the most inaccurate representation of WW2, it should be called shot in the Backfield 5. Garbage game do not but this dont even get the EA pass to play this shitty game. Worst 11 hours of my life fuck this game fuck EA fuck Dice and fuck all the sweaty bitches that play this garbage fucking game too. Terrible -10/10. Dont do it, dont play this game."
"Battlefield - ❌❌❌

Cheat-Field - ✅✅✅"
"What a pos of a BF game in 2024.

- meta is lame af
- massive vehicle spam in matches
- cheaters everywhere, BF1 was cheater free compared to this 
- most lobbies terribly imbalanced, hardly ever making for a good game
- toxic idiotic player base (the rotten left-overs of the former player base)

I thouroughly started to hate the game after a short while.

₣𝔘ℂ𝝟 𝙀Ầ !!"
"Worst game ever its rage game no tanks just literly spawn kill or be killed. 

ENLISTED better"
It's have more bugs with saves
probably the worst battlefield experience you could ask for. PC gameplay is horrible compared to console. can we all do a the gaming community a favor and just let this game franchise die like the neglected dog it is.
Recently EA have added kernel anti-cheat which intentionally blocks anyone on Linux playing so i can't recommend
"Can't even open the game.

Look, If you're going to sell a bad game for an absurd price at least let me play it. I have tried everything but EA hasn't done jack shit so far and doesn't want to offer any kind of assistance."
"to many cheaters, lads on 3-4 lvl going 54/7... sniping u across the another end of the map."
"Low population. Stacked Teams (No Moderators/Admins/Community Servers).

No hardcore mode.

All weapons unlocked, doesn't make sense to see G.I's with MP40's and Japanese soldiers with Thompsons. No historical accuracy at all.

Female soldiers everywhere, black germans? Wheres the toggle to turn the game into an actual WW2 game? Oh yea. Its not one."
"Bring back BF3 and BF4!! I dont want to play anymore ""old"" war games anymore"
Just NAH
plane play sucks dick
"Not fun. Maps are designed terribly. Movement is a little too arcade-y even for bf games. Seeing guy crouch run and slide with big lmg is dumb. No more classic spotting. Its pings, doesn’t feel right. Don’t recommend this game.
Bf1 is much better and more immersive. Bf1 is more fun. Bf4 is also fun and better than this"
No chance finding a game now. Don't waste your money.
"Not enough tanks
I dont die to tanks enough. All of the pacific theater maps need more tanks. I dont like the tanks currently because theyre not overpowered enough. They dont shoot through bunkers hard enough and their armor against literally every explosive is wayy to weak
Buff tanks"
"Battlefield V features engaging combat and impressive visuals, but is hindered by limited server availability and an unbalanced time-to-kill in standard game modes. These issues can make gameplay frustrating, especially for newcomers or those seeking a more consistent and fair experience in multiplayer matches."
why do i have to install anti cheat if im just gonna play the campaign?
EA continues to get worse. If not newest no support so therefore hacker paradise. Maps are awful. Bullet physics don't existent. 2/10 at best
This game has disgusting micro stuttering even on i9 14900K paired with RTX 4090
wont run on linux
Not fun
"couldn't skip the intro and ""tutorial"""
Game is not launching
"Don't buy this game, this is the last time I'm falling for this S#!% EA, if it was just the horrible balance of weapons, or the In-stent spawn kills (you can't spawn next to your squad member during a fight, but don't worry, will send you right next to 3 enemies soldier GL)  i wouldn't even be writing this review at all, but the consent ping falls (it over 9000) and the hackers have put the last nail in the coffin.
I wouldn't recommend buying there games with a discount   -.- (i would ask for a refund if i could) -.-
at this point its feels like EA is just trolling 

I all most never right reviews, but i couldn't stop myself this time... i really don't understand how they are ""mostly positive"""
inhuman  ct
Recoil is ridiculous and the players are always sweaty. Also WOKE NONSENSE.
"boring, bad shooting system."
"Hard no.

It may have been good when it came out (idk?), but every match is determined by people looking to grief the match.

You think you are playing a competitive game, but your participation means nothing. Your kd means nothing. It is all about who takes the tanks in to points, or out of them... and that happens ""in reverse"" due to malacious intent every single gd match.

Do not waste your money or time on this game. Nor bf1. This series is gone."
waste of money and freaking time full of hackers and hackers an only hackers niggas be killing you from 400 meters with a pistol
EA app is shit
This games blows
dont buy it u get ban for no reason to ea louncher and all your games BANED.
This game had the potential to be a really good game but in classic EA fashion they pre maturely killed the game
"I played for 10 hours, and spent another 12 hours trying to connect to online servers. 
EA Games = Clowns. RIP"
"dont buy this game , the game just wont launch , try fix but cant play this shit"
"Battlefield V, what a disaster this was from trailer, to release, to current day. This game is no longer supported by EA/DICE nor will they likely be touching this game (Since BF2042 exists), so this is a ""What you see, what you get"" situation now. This game was released in 2018, mainly a successor to Battlefield 1 (released in 2016). However Battlefield V did a lot of things different from Battlefield 1 that made me not enjoy it as much as BF1, a lot of changes were rather questionable too.

Positives:
Lots of unique weapons (69 counted, including some from BF1)
Customization for Soldiers, Vehicles, and Aircraft
Amazing final Warstory
Good visuals and effects
Crouch-sprinting
Squad-revive system
Fortification system
Reinforcement system

Negatives:
Specialization system
Poor multiplayer map design. (Some maps allowing spawn kills while others are way too open.)
COD-Like Sliding (even though sliding was in Battlefield 1, BFV's sliding feels more closely to COD sliding than what it was in BF1)
Spotting replaced with squad-based pinging.
Reviving is no longer gadget based but animation based. (No syringe gadget)
Weird gun control. (some guns feel less accurate when ADSing and so on)
Ghillie Suit cosmetics or comsetics that make it difficult to ID targets at times.
No accessbility option to disable or have player cosmetics mirror your own.
Below-Average warstories (All of them have at least one stealth section or more too)
Terrible stealth in Warstories (Downgrade from BF1's stealth)
HP has a ""fixed"" state so you can't repair/heal to full HP at times unless you have bandages (on-foot) or resupply at a marked resupply depot (vehicle)
Elite Kits are non-existant
No custom emblems
No suppression despite being given points for it at times (Suppression was removed from what users say)
A Lack of a Codex (Battlefield 1 had a Codex which taught history about the weapons, world, and of the 1st World War itself)
Minimum DogTag customization/options
No Behemoths (Likely a result of the Reinforcement system)
Only 4 playable factions (compared to BF1's 10 playable factions)
No end-of-game map voting. (Meaning each map is played in order and they aren't scrambled)

As a result I just couldn't like the game. In the end this game feels like it plays more like COD than a Battlefield game which meant my experience wasn't that pleasant. My recommendation is to buy it on sale if you want to give it a try. For me however, this game is below-average and I can not really recommend it in the end."
game macam babi buk banyak
Bring back Steam Deck support!
Save your money
"Wont run, EA ruines everything they touch. AntiCheat is causing issues on my PC and after 3hours of basic troubleshooting nothing helpes> Please dont bother buying any EA game. If i have to pay for a product i demand it runs instantly"
hackers hackers and hackers :(
"Save your money and your time, this just ain't worth it. Go play BF4/BF3"
"Terrible progression system with little to no depth. 
Most people have fully kitted guns with enhanced fire rate traits making everything you use feel useless? To get said traits you need daily/ weekly currency.....wtf is this mobile game design?

Additionally flat maps with no cover are awful to play on? The game doesn't give you enough tools to deal with vehicle and sniper dominated maps. It just makes a complete mess of a game design wise? The only positive is the setting...and even then that's highly inaccurate. 

Save your money and your time, this just ain't worth it. Go play BF4/BF3. Glad I picked this up dirt cheap and not full price."
"Forcing you to linear play, minimum options for improvization and buggy.  Headshooted flamethrower guy 5 times and nothing until you come near and activate his script."
"MP maps way too small, gives me claustrophobia."
Its just bf1 but worse. But hey man the pacific maps are fun.
"This game is literally held together with tape. Invisible walls everywhere. Try to shoot someone you hit a wall thats not there!!!!!!!@!!!!!!! Ai enemies not taking damage in story. The Ai cheat hard in this pile of trash. cant skip videos WTF this game is a pile of trash!!!
The story mode is not fun at all less you like sneaking around might as well play splinter cell."
Keeps crashing after countless attempts of fixing it and every time I open this game it shows me first time intro screen the story and the whole bunch of sheet
"TOO MANY CHEATERS, 
THESE ARE TYPE OF CHEAT THEY WERE USING:
- THE FLASH, RUN SO FAST, ALMOST DO TELEPORTATION
- AIM BOT"
Shitty game. I just started playing and I have to fight lvl 500 players campering every corner and cheating.
"Game was pretty bad at launch. After years of ignoring it, I jumped back in. It is somehow worse. Less BF more COD fag. 

Might only be $10 but save the money and stuff it deep inside your pee hole, its still a better use of your money than this garbage."
would be fine cheaters are insane
bad
One of the worst multiplayer games I have ever played.
"Garbage, no wonder this franchise is dying
Play bf4/3 instead"
What I can do is only sightseeing
New anti-cheat is trash.
horrible game
"New EA Anticheat broke the support for Linux and therefore for Steamdeck as well. No big surprise that EA does not care about customers, but it's a shame that a game that worked perfectly well for several years under Proton is no longer playable."
"I cannot recommend a game that crashes on startup no matter what I do to try and fix it. If you're at all interested in the game, be warned that you may not be able to even play it. EA ought to be crucified for this.

UPDATE: Frosty Mod Manager trips up EA Anti Cheat and stops the game from launching, this happens for all EA games with an anti-cheat even if you're only using Frosty for one game. If you're having similar problems you can find a fix online. EA should still be crucified for adding their awful anti-cheat."
"Probably the worst Battlefield ever.

Tries a lot of stuff and fails so miserably that all the features that came from older titles and were changed (spotting, gun loadouts...) were reverted by the next entry.

If you are a veteran (at least since Bad Company) you will have to relearn the whole game, the minimap Is almost useless, noone uses the context spotting cause it's pointless, clutters your vision and it just sucks, so you have to use your eyes and ears, which sounds amazing until you realize that the maps barely have effective cover, so it's basically getting lucky and catching the enemy by surprise (or them catching you by surprise cause you have no effective intel)

With that said, the game can be fun in TDM (sometimes, if you don't get a cheater, which there are a lot of) cause spotting doesn't matter that much in such closed spaces, depends on the map though.

Fuck context spotting, fuck specializations and personally, fuck the game entirely honestly. Only worth a buy if under 10€ and to play a couple hours max if you get good maps."
"Waste of Money and a Trash Game, OG BF1 players would be devastated .EA shame on you."
cant even play this game without cheater in a match. wasted their money on their anticheat
Poor Performance. Moving on to Delta Force
"I’ll tell you right off the bat—I don’t get why people like this game. It’s just so frustrating.

First off, the “downed state” you’re forced into every time you’re killed is incredibly annoying, and I can’t believe they even carried it into Battlefield 2042. It completely breaks the flow of gameplay.

Then there’s the weapon selection. Unlike Battlefield 1, where every gun felt impactful, Battlefield V’s starting weapons are weak and uninspiring. It feels like you have to use the meta loadouts just to have a fighting chance; otherwise, you’re outgunned in almost every scenario.

The map design only makes things worse. So many maps have wide open areas where you’re an easy target for tanks, snipers, or mounted MGs. On one map, the B flag is practically in full view of the enemy spawn, with only a small, broken house as cover. It’s a frustrating design choice that leads to endless, annoying deaths.

The one thing I do like is the addition of ammo and medic caches you can build on the map. This cuts down on the reliance on Support players for ammo, which is a nice touch. But even this feature can’t save the game from its other issues.

Team composition and the weapons assigned to Medics are also frustrating. Medics have short TTK weapons, so they often ignore revives to focus on combat instead. This means you’re left lying in that awful downed state for way too long.

All in all, I can’t recommend Battlefield V. The game is full of annoying mechanics and design flaws that make it feel like a step backward. If you want a real Battlefield experience, I’d suggest going back to Battlefield 1 or Battlefield 4 instead."
"I love this game, it has been my go to for many years, I have played it for hundreds of hours on origin. I wish I didn't have to write this review but it pains me to know I won't be able to play this game without EA's malware (kernel level anti-cheat) running deep within my system. Removing Linux support was a horrible decision and one I can't stand by."
get you shit together EA and fix the goddamn battlefield 1 anti cheat bs this is hot garbage compared to 1
This game is a goddamn joke
"This pile of EA sh*t is another example of why pirating a game is going to become mainstream. I can't start the game because the game doesn't want to start. Why? Due to it's stupid anti cheat. Well you might think: that's cause you're a cheater. Thing is, how can I be a cheater if i have not played the game at all so far? Also, how can i be a cheater if i have nothing open in the background. It's simple. I have Rectify 11 installed and Nilesoft Shell to make my Windows 11 more bearable. But you might think, how does this matter for this game... Well, this game's anti cheat thinks that Nilesoft Shell is a hack, and that i try to cheat in this game, and won't even let me play single player. If you want to avoid at least a day of troubleshooting why the damn game won't even start, buy this. If not, pirate it, do the single player and move on... To me, no more EA games anymore. It's clear they don't want me as a customer, even if i only want to play single player (for now, or why would i even try it's multiplayer if it won't let me launch).

PS, if you're wondering where i got the 2h of gameplay, it's from before it's last update which completely broke it for me. I played 2h in the first mission back then, called it a day, and now i returned to the game after a few months. In the meantime they updated it with a broken anti cheat, for a game that doesn't even have that much of a multiplayer scene anyway."
"DAWG WATER GAME, POOR GUN PLAY, NO SERVERS, HIGH PING, CHEATERS? DO NOT BUY EVEN FOR $7.50 ITS TRASH"
they where NOT cooking
didint work
unrealistic stories that i didn't expected for a game that describes ww2
boo
"Found it very boring, coming from BFBC2 this is a certain downgrade in fun and implementation."
"Absolutely God awful, stay away from that trash"
This game was fun BUT get boring so quickly
"Cheaters Fest.
the only reason I bought this trash was I heard there's gonna be an anti cheat. 
and there is. but EA anti cheat is as helpful as a broken condom. 
I encounter cheaters every match. EVERY FUCKING MATCH. no matter what time of the day you're playing a cheater will ruin ur day. 
last night I had this guy who one shot u in the leg with any weapon and he used his Teleport ability to get away. 
this morning I thought this is gonna be good time to play cuz cheaters are probably asleep. but I just saw another dude who could hedshot u from miles away with a lewis gun. he had 80 kills and 0 death. the best guy in our team had 19 kills!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if u think there's no cheater you're most likely too naive to spot em or you're the type who camps in a tank or a plane the whole match that's why cheaters don't affect u. 
and reporting them doesn't do anything. my whole team report a cheater but he's still in the match. Dice doesn't ban anyone. cuz as I said it's a broken condom. 
Fuck Dice. Fuck Condoms"
ARABIC
"EA play always runs into issues when trying to launch this game. why do i need to have 2 different clients login to access one game, absolutely stupid"
Wasted 10$ for it NOT TO EVEN RUN AT 40 FPS WHILE HAVING A 4060 TI AND A 12400F LIKE WHAT THE FCK... NOT TO MENTION ALL THE OTHER BUGS
"I have more hours and origin and bought it on steam to play it on Linux.

I can’t play anymore because of the integration of the new anti cheat.

The game was working perfectly fine before. 
As a consumer, I feel deeply disrespected"
Doesn’t work on Steam Deck.
"i love battlefield but the amount of lite cheaters is insane, to give you an example there are aimbot programs that also give you the option to tell you if someone is aiming at you  i only play on hardcore servers and see for your self if you hide somewhere with a sniper and aim in the general direction of other snipers a lot of them suddenly move away even when no one else  is shooting at them"
"So many problems. One of the biggest is the insane amount of cheaters still in the game, even after the ""anticheat"". Wouldn't recommend unless you hate enjoying life"
MY CHARACTER IS A GIRL??!?!?!? WHAAAT INNACCURATE!! THERE WAS BASICALLY NO GIRLS DYING ON THE BATTLEFRONT. woke shet EA
"EA decided to fix cheaters on windows by breaking game on linux. Welp, there already tons of reasons to pirate EA games, you just added another game to that list."
"I have underestimated EA.
Anti - launching the game - cheat and crap
Because fuck you that's why

DO NOT EVER BUY EA GAME. Do not help the enemy."
"It's Battlefield, I'd rather slam my dick in a car door than ever touch this piece of shit ever again in my life, I would rather marry the love of my life, have 2 beautiful children with her, watch her die of a terminal illness, and be raising them alone as a single father, never wanting to fall in love again mourning the great loss I suffered. I would rather stub my pinky toe 100x over than ever even glance as this POS game. Completely ass, would never recommend, would rather play literally anything else. Also gotta install the EA dogshit software just to play a piece of dogshit. 

PS I fucking HATE Battlefield.
PSS i tried playing again drunk, still ass, how can a game be bad when drunk?"
This game is perfectly playable on Linux -- or it would be if EA didn't blanket ban all Linux players. Steam also refuses to issue a refund even though the product was literally taken away from me on a whim.
"i hate the number ""v"""
"A lot of bugs while playing the campaign, the multiplayer is unbalanced, game is not optimized at all, hackers are everywhere."
bad
"Unless you've got an opportunity to buy at a great discount, I wouldn't recommend. There aren't many hardcore servers running, and if you're in NA most of the community servers have poor ping. There are definitely hackers running about at light speed occasionally.

While they definitely did improve by adding the Pacific maps, the stupid decisions that the devs made are still present. EA and DICE are bad companies that you shouldn't support. Spend your money on better games like Hell Let Loose and stop giving these clowns money.

I got it for like $3 and wouldn't put more than that into it."
"It is as feared.

US uniforms in 1940

Women soldiers

The SBS being referred to as criminals 

Basic controls 


Don't even buy this on deal!"
"It was quite the satisfaction to delete this obnoxious thing called Battlefield V from my PC. 
I would rather play Mario Kart than this ****."
"Mmmm.  I played the first mission and the last one.  Unskippable mid and after-action cutscenes sure make this game drag on.  I alt-tabbed over to type this review because I'm not interested in being forced to watch the cinematic feels for the Nazi tank commander and his crew.  Aircraft are a joke in this game; both flying them and shooting at them.  They fly with the the grace and speed of pigeons when you're shooting them, have magical tracking abilities if they're shooting at you, and do some stupid rubber-banding when you're flying one.  Fly away from your target for thirty seconds, patiently gaining altitude and distance, then turn back and you've got a good 3 seconds to lineupyourtargetOMGthereitISSHOOT-NO-TIME-PULL-UP!  Would not recommend.  I can't imagine paying the full retail on this game."
fix the game launcher for heavens sake EA
"One of the best battlefield games out there (BF1 was trash).

That being said, I mostly played this on console when it first came out. Bought this again on pc and the majority of the servers were dead. The ones that weren't or had any sort of population was fine at first, but as soon as there's a distinct losing team they turn on their mods/hacks and don't lose more than 5 tickets while yours get absolutely drained. Not worth playing anymore 2024 onward. This game has zero anticheat, you're not going to have fun."
Do not buy any EA games. Hackers Paradise and they do not care.
гавно❗ не дали мастерство на разведчика
BF 1 better
"Oh yeah please make LMGs more unfun to use i am sure everyone loves it...

Witnessing battlefield to evolve backwards."
"Garbage. Worst of the battlefield games so far. Aiming in this game is terrible,  and the settings are ridiculous and over complicated in the options. Stories are a joke, that's not a campaign."
"Vittu mitä paskaa, enemmän codi kun bäfä. Kannattaa ostaa BF 1 mielummin vaikka tonnilla kun tämä 3 eurolla, saatte enemmän vastinetta rahoille.

In English:
Paska peli"
Feels More Call Of Duty Than Battlefield...
Insane lags when any other game runs smoothly. Shame..
Парашка
when the competition is making newer anti cheat that doesn't work while worsening the game and my opponent is EA
"Playing this game it's more like I'm disrespecting the history of the war. Too much of cosmetics in WW2....game.....
It's like bunch of ""clowns"" running around the war instead of real soldiers....

Welp, I'm just gonna stick to BF1 instead"
fucking campfest
definitive edition give me the fucking special class mastery assignment!
First they take your money and then block you from playing because you're not using the right OS.
"Don't touch it. Play Battlefield 1 instead. It has better graphics, gameplay, controls, audio, feeling, customization, etc. Just please don't buy this."
"I purchased the game because I loved the old BF1942. Though the graphics are much more stunning in this, the constant having to unlock weapons is annoying. Why can't everyone just get the same weapons out of the box? 
Lastly, I game on Linux, and now with the Kernel level anti-cheat, I can't even play the game in single player mode. I mean, if it's single player, why do I need anti-cheat? A thumbs down to EA for shitting on a game I liked."
"Worked fine on Steam Deck for years, now they suddenly added kernel level spyware, making even singleplayer impossible to play on Steam Deck, Linux or inside VMs.

You still have more people cheating in multiplayer than ever before, as there are multiple known workarounds to create a new account without paying again. Yet actually legit players are no longer allowed to start the game.

Zero logic, pure actionism, typical EA move. Just stay away from anything this company is involved in."
"Revised Review: When this game went on sale for $7.49, I decided I might try the game out. Well, after playing for a while, I started to enjoy the game a little bit more, the campaigns are a bit more open world then previous entries, although not to the same quality. Multiplayer is alright, although if you live in the US, you're basically fucked, the only consistent US servers are run by a discord group and practically almost always have a waiting queue of a couple players. I don't think it's as awful as I did before, but I still don't recommend this game.
Original Review: When I saw this game on sale for $7.49 I figured that even if I didn't play it for too long I would still get my money's worth. And after trying a bit of everything I have to admit I have not gotten that money's worth. The single-player story was meh at best, and the online multiplayer was not as enjoyable as previous entries. If you want something akin to this game I would highly recommend Battlefield 1 instead."
"After 5 years, EA still doesn’t give a f to that imbecilic reloading saved gameplay issue. Before buying this, keep in mind that although you’ve played the game for a couple of hours, as soon as you quit the game and restart it, your settings will be default again and you need to run through all the opening plots again. Great job EA, such a POS"
Trash
Game is good but EA is useless
"I played this game for a while, but then I stopped for a year because my PC couldn’t run it. Now that I’ve upgraded, I decided to come back and play, only to find out I was banned for no reason. 

4/10 it was fun tho."
"they banned me in this game i dont like it why they banned me i play all the games 
unbanned me Battlefield V"
"completamente bugado, prefiro ffazer uma lobotomia, precisei usar programinha pra liberar conquistas bugadas, terrivel experiencia."
cheaters
Doesnt work on linux anymore. Is winows paying yall off or are you just too lazy to check a box on battleye software?
"i really loved this game… all Battlefield games are awesome the only downside whit all of them is EA and DICE trying to squeeze every single penny out of their community and somehow they are not even trying to please the community.

cool und fun for casual gaming on playstation or pc but every other port has major problems or the support just got cut of like on the steamdeck… thats sad i bought it just for my steamdeck cuz i really liked it on ps4 

sad but true i will never buy anything from EA or DICE… so many years of “oh com on EA is not that bad” are over"
played this game back on xbox and it was great. got it again for PC and I couldn't even launch the game. I tried asking support but no one would help me. if you can get the game to run then I'd recommend it but im not paying any amount of money for a game that doesn't work on my system.
"another trash game. trash movement, trash tanks, trash server quality. if you are a movement player, like warzone or bo6, never try it. I regret the one hour of my life I put into trying this out."
Shuttering and clunky
"Went to play the game after months of inactivity, found that EA intentionally broke Linux support. Won't be buying online games from these scam artists again, I have enough unplayable garbage now thanks."
"Lost all my stats when I loaded the game on steam, Forced me to play 2042. It's a sad point in time for battlefield!"
it is mid
Adolf Rizzler is not in the game as promised
ea + crashes on launch
"i dont know but the server is pretty awful for company this big, especialy in asia server

and encountering few chineese that is toxic on voice chat"
"Either servers are empty are they are way across the world the US server empty
If you want to play the Campaign for but MP you won't get that experience it seems"
It just wont start
"Something went wrong!

The EA app encountered an error and couldn't finish installing (error code: INST-3-1920)


FUCK THIS AND FUCK YOU."
BF 1 is so much better and has better gameplay and graphics even though it came years before this.Also this game on PC in infested with cheaters and EA went from useless Dice anticheat to another useless EA anticheat as people still are cheating in a major way.Instead of making a proper anticheat system they spend time developing garbage like 2042.Next BF will probably suck as well and will have the same cheating issues like previous ones.If you really want to play this game then I suggest do it on console as cheatiing is not noticable there so much.
"Sadly can't give a positive review considering I barley put an hour on this and the single player cut scenes run at like 4fps and every 20 minutes the game shuts off my pc. I got a brand new pc with a i9, a 4090, and 64gb of ram. The fact this game is doing this makes it absolute garbage."
cant launch the game
No realism. Downgrade from BF1
"Game told me i was banned the moment i booted it up, no way of taking that ban out, wasted money."
"rather un-fun, no rhyme or reason as to weapon damage, everything feels rng"
"The game stopped working on Linux.
Can't refund it, but won't recommend it to anyone due to the blatant disregard for their customer's experience on the side of EA.

It is not ok to break game compatibility on a whim."
"dude battlefield 1 came years before and is so m,much better still like lmaoooooo"
NO
constantly crash after playing for 30-45 minutes.

"hey! i got an idea! lets make a video game about a group of super tough muslim and black women who led a secret special forces group that was like totally responsible for putting an end to napoleon's reign of terror!!! that happened!!!!! right ...????

ok, how about an all super far left feminist movement chicks who totally aren't butch ... maybe... but totally kick butt and they show up to save george washington's butt in the revolutionary war with a bunch of freed african slaves who were actually nigerian special forces before they were captured by white guys in khaki shorts and carrying elephant guns and horribly enslaved ""back in da day! yo ...."" that help like totally defeat the french! i mean british ... wait, was it the british or the french we were fighting? or both ...??? hmmm ... like, im totally getting a headache yo ... 

ok, ok, how about this ... a bunch of super tough, but totally not butch chicks free a school of down syndrome children from the nazi's and show them their true potential! they build a time machine, and we go into past, and we meet up with a bunch of minority and/or effeminate men who like totally worship us and the down syndrome kids like totally kill hitler before he takes power and stops ww2 and totally saves the world! and like, totally put a native american in it too!!!! a female native american! who teams up with an angry tomboyish 15 year old, who totally isn't butch! maybe ... and they like totally rebel against her overbearing dad, who turns out to be an awful bad guy she has to get rid of and replace with her girl power while all the sissy guys cheer me on! yay! girl power! right ...??? 

ok, ok, how about this ... a super tough muslim chick leads an insurgency where tons of muslim dudes obey her every command, like, you know, that's totally believable right??? oh wait, COD already did that with one of their crap shows??? darn ....

ok, ok, how about we do one where we show how it was actually overwhelming numbers of black men in the northern army that won the civil war! and we'll make lincoln black! and grant! and hell, we'll even make good ol boy robert e lee black! no ... wait ... a muslim woman!!! but a strong tough muslim woman!!! who's actually a teenager rebelling against her overbearing evil dad!!! totally wicked!!! right ... guys ...??? i mean this is all the stuff you're weird teacher with the long red hair on one side and the short blue hair on the other side in the middle of transitioning taught you guys too in school, right ...???? 

am i the only person who thinks nancy pelosi and the obamas bought EVERY company in the world that makes video games? and then immediately installed an angry woman at the helm? or an effeminate and/or gay man desperately trying to impress/not make mad some angry woman who is about to take his job??? is there ever going to be a time when they make a game about an actual historical event that took place nearly a century before wokeness was a thing without injecting 2024 semen and bile into it before sticking it int he microwave and overcooking it??? i mean really?

my real, non-sarcastic/exasperated/fed up with modern garbage review is:
made P.T.E.16 (Post Trump Election in 2016) so of course it's full of woke silliness. any games made nowadays that aren't? further, to be quite honest, i wasn't as impressed with it as i was COD WW2, and i wasn't necessarily thrilled with that either. smash those 2 things together and yeah, it could've been better. alot better. but why do we need quality when we can shove nordic mother/teenage daughter terminator teams down the nazi's throats while black french soldiers run commado ops to show those whiteys what for!!! but get their brothers killed being too overzealous to tell the man to shove it and spend the rest of their life regretting it before telling the sad fairy tale that never happened to some kid who doesn't care 50 years later .... we are so screwed. but it's ok, i'm sure a bunch of girl power me too movement chicks will show up with a bunch of effeminate dudes to fix everything any day now ... annnnnnnyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy day now......."
At the time of writing this it's just cheaters versus cheaters in the top scores. I had way more fun with this game than I expected though!
Fun game but they broke support for steam deck. Sucks especially when there wasn't really a cheater issue. Can't recommend

Why more ch**ting in game?
"blocked steam deck and linux users from playing the game by adding a subpar kernel anticheat into a 6 year old game, without any care or concern shown to people who were able to perfectly play the game on their respective systems."
"De facto abandonware. Issues with visibility and bugs remain unfixed, while the maps are generally mediocre. The gunplay is decent and on sale it's not a terribly buy, but a WW2 game missing so many factions is absolutely atrocious."

The graphics and animations are really good though."

TO MUCH CHEATER
Thank you for help. Now my game begining play.
"not fun anymore sbmm is terrible and there are barely anyone playing, it was good and never will be again, all battlefield games are complete and utter trash"
Less QOL and immersion than BF1... the WW2 setting and equipment is an improvement (BF1 really felt like a WW2 game with WW1 aesthetics) and there are some neat ideas but BF1 is still better.

this applies to BF 2042 and CoD franchise too . just play some thing PvE and enjoy your life brothers ."
"battlefield 5 more like shìtfield 5 because this game is full of shìt. Shìt gun, shìt map, shìt game mechanics. Like DICE is feeding me shìt when I play this game. yummers (/≧▽≦)/"
"I actually really like this game but after returning after 6 months i always get the same error from the crappy eaac: EA anticheat has detected an unacceptable configuration 115. Killed the standard culprits like razer synapse and any audio softwares, reinstalled the game, reinstalled the anticheat, nothing worked. I read on forums that this happens on brand new pc's so it is definetly the shitty anticheat. 

TLDR: DO NOT BUY! ANTICHEAT WON'T LET YOU PLAY EVEN IF YOU DO NOTHING WRONG AND EVEN  AFTER RESETING YOUR PC"

"Somehow banned before I even purchased the game and having never been banned in any EA game before and being able to play other battlefields without issue, EA declined my appeal, classic.
Wanted to see what this game was like now that its gotten some stability, waste of time and money clearly just get BF1 instead."
"poxy fucking players, that are cowards, who jump out of there plane when they know they are going to due"
This game is still so bad in 2024. Last time I played this game was 2020 and the thing I noticed is that there are more players. The connectivity is so poor. I got disconnected while playing where I got 50+ kills and the game was about to end despite my good internet. Don't recommend this game. I'd rather play Battlefield 1 or Battlefield 4.
not allowed to play it because its connected to a idiotic app called ea
𝕗𝕣𝕖𝕒𝕜𝕪
The solo campaign is great I enjoy the story and details related to World War 2 but playing the multiplayer makes me want to break my monitor the skill level in this game is unbelievable and makes me want to break something every time I get shot or blown up by a tank or plane and being shot out of nowhere from other players that I can't even see running around and diving from cover to cover like Call of Duty Warzone. New players I don't recommend picking up this game and hoping into the multiplayer unless you want to break something.
Probably worst SP campaign I have played lately. Barely worth the 5 $ in sale
Filled with cheaters and the game is no longer worked on don't buy it.
"In no way historically accurate, and cheaters in every game. Fun and casual game, if you want to compete with cheaters or are lucky to get a server with few or none..."
Would not recommend buying for the single player experience.
not worth it
getting ban for no reason while real hackers and cheaters reign every server in asia with absolute privilege
dirty game from dirty company
Why add a anti cheat that renders it unplayable for steam deck and linux users ? they should have left it like it was its not like people who actually cheat will stop cheating because of a new anti cheat. you cant even play single player wtf. dont buy this game if you use steamdeck or linux.
"Loading is so slow that I could have taken a nap before this game started. Story line is non existent, short clips of random crap that EA was able to figure out. Oh look you are running now, now you are sitting, now you are driving now and now you are flying. Great, thanks I really liked the characters and the story line of all 30 seconds of the game. Talking about flying, for some reason only the flying inverts your mouse and there is no way to re-invert it to be just like the rest of the game because of reasons. If you had plenty of that crap then you might as well take a nap because turning it off takes years. I don't actually know how long since life is too short to wait for this EA monstrosity to turn off."
i got blew up by a tank like im the school thot in the bathroom
"terrible, corny soldier skins"
"Well, here we go again ... in desperate search for a fun shooter after a long time, I grabbed this (older) one during a sale and finally decided to give it a chance. But apparently, 'long-term' fun shooters just don't exist anymore [b] these [/b] days.

At least not if you [b] don't [/b] want to play yet another [i] mainstream, (ability-based) tactical shooter [/i] or the next [i] cash-grab, toxic sweaty battle royale game[/i]. Thanks to the big developers/publishers for ruining what used to be fun for gamers in their hunt for the next ""whale"" and monetized battle-pass dependent piece of trash.

As for the game itself? It seems like a pretty decent experience at first glance, but already after only a short playtime, it feels like just another run-down, large-scale frustrating shooter neglected by the developers/publishers. I don't think it's necessary to elaborate much further beyond describing my first 5 games... 4 out of 5 of them featured the highly motivating presence of 1-3 small pp cheaters.

- I mean, sure, with level 13, it's totally believable when these guys are rocking a 60-70 kill streak with absurd kill-death ratios and a similar kd difference in the end stats ... but get gud I guess ... -

remark: yes, I'm aware its meanwhile a 6 year old game but I guess this review has already turned more into a general rant about current game industry anyway

In the end, I guess money always wins over fun. Shame on the people that contribute and make this possible by buying $50+ bundles every time they see some tits and ass out outfit or glowing RGB lights slapped on yet another (same) female skin — for the 20th time obv — rather than demanding anything better.

Is it really that difficult to consistently care for a community that just wants to play your shit for a few hours a day without dealing with all this other nonsense? Unique mechanics, good support and a diverse experience instead of mainstream bullshit that loses 90% of its player base in the first three months anyway, ESPECIALLY with all the insane dev tech we have rn, i mean come on ...

... just give us Titanfall III and don't mess that shit up at least.
Oh, wait, what's that? Apex made EA just $3.5 billion? My bad, I guess ...

I think people that play videogames just a little longer than before the Fortnite era would agree, games we loved back than and [b] do till this day [/b] are getting rarer than a fucking needle in a haystack and thats just sad and frustrating ... or maybe Im just getting too old ¿already? whatever I wanted just a fun shooter guess I'll play this one more whatsoever, what other, [i] better [/i] options are there anyway

However this shit in other words, ""Müsst ihr wissen"" — Der Präsident"
"constantly having to reinstall  to get the game working, there are others with same issue but it hasnt been resolved for years"
"At first it seems fun, fighting the war with your friends. But the hackers, man they really take out the fun from the game. With EA not doing anything to address those hackers, playing this game make me rate this a 3/10."
"The game is hard as hell even at the easiest difficulty level. If you expect shooting from the cover type of game like Call of Duty, this game is not for you. You have to think and utilize tactics. Disclaimer: I never play multiplayer, this is only about Single Player missions."
A really bad FPS that requires a whole lot of luck and patience which I don't have and only have veterans that camp in hidden ass spots and shooting my ass to oblivion and I couldn't even look at the horizon because a fat hairy dude just sits there watching YouTube waiting for a head to pop up and snipe it. 1/10
You know the game is bad when I buy the game on steam and have to install the ea launcher to play it really fun and innovative
"I usualy dont do reviews to any game,but the experience I had in this game was so horrible that I feel the need to share,i bought the game while it was on sale, as i have played bf1 for many hours I was expecting a somewhat similar experience, but it ended up being the worst fps i ever played in life, to start the war stories are horrible, different from bf1 the stories themselves are very senseless and woke, the gameplay is super boring from start to end, the only good story is the last tiger but its gameplay is one of the most boring there is, while on multiplayer its completely impossible, in every concept, it's filled with hackers and when a 500 level player comes is basically your end, filled with tank and plane, you spawn and die spawn and die a thousand times, it's just ridiculous, plus the battle itself feel dead and boring even its caotic battles feel boring, and this because i chose to ignore the endless amount of wokeness u find in this game, the character personalization is a total joke,if u like historically accurate games this one is the worst i have ever seen,overall the game is just horrible,it failed at every possible thing it could fail,in the other hand even tough inaccurate bf1 its predecessor is a wonderfull game one that i really love,in the end bfv is worthless and i regret buying it and wasting my time with it"
The story is full of woke marxist propaganda.
"joined a match, got killed through solid walls 3 times in a row. abandoned. it's all just cheaters and people who played enough to compete with them"
in iran need vpn for play this game :/
Just another stupid arcade game. Just play Hell Let Loose instead
"I got it for free, i want my money back"
this is probably the worst BF i have ever played. i had way more fun clicking the uninstall button than playing this heap of dog shit. it needs to die so Hardline can come back to life.
the players were more cheaters
stupid shit game fuck u
very janky
"It's an alright game. I guess it does its job, but for anyone who loved how immersive Battlefield ""1"" was, you may find it disappointing like I did. And no, that's not because women exist - the sounds and feel just aren't as convincing. I think it's perhaps how sunny the maps are...? Weird complaint, and I know realistically wars have obviously been fought on ""nice"" days, but it somehow just doesn't work for me personally. 
I also found that the class system doesn't feel as important as it did in 1. I found no satisfaction tossing out ammo or healing people because it felt less imperative and more accessible to all classes.

Meanwhile the singleplayer story was not compelling enough for me to bother with fully.

I will say that being able to customise your soldiers and weapons is great, but that's about as good as it gets for me.

Consider this a maybe rather than a no. If PVP is your bread and butter, it does its job well enough."
"Can't even play the game because EA f*rked up again, the launcher is broken and crashes, with no official solution being provided after all these years. EA at its best ..."

        [td]Battlefield V feels like a step backward compared to its predecessors. The gameplay is not as polished, with clunky mechanics and a noticeable lack of refinement. The content feels limited, especially when compared to Battlefield 1, which had a richer variety of maps, weapons, and modes. To make matters worse, the game is plagued by cheaters, which can ruin the experience for those looking to enjoy fair, competitive play. While it still delivers moments of intense action, the overall experience is diminished by these glaring issues.[/td]

"If you wanna shoot people 100 times before they die this games for you. Honestly the weapon play is garbage and its so unsatisfying to have to dump half a mag from a thompson smg into somebody to kill them. Even shotguns are pure garbage to use at ranges farther than 5 feet. Not to mention how weak tanks feel in the game. Like I get theres supposed to be game balance but its just so unfun to have to mag dump someone while getting aimbotted by snipers from across the map through tress with no line of sight. The amount of cheaters and just issues make me never want to play a battlefield game again. Honestly I loved the bad company games which felt great to play, but honestly call of dutys looking like the better option when it comes to gameplay now."
so much hacking and cheat brooo
kaki :<
Every other battlefield is better then this (even bad company)
Can suicide bomb in jeeps! :)

"-3 score The game had so much potition for nothing, Only the single player worth, The guns you can play on each class it will be or overpower or worthless , Dont buy it even in sales"
i can't play it in IRAN
"one of the better battlefields. 2 servers with a full lobby. The enemies' guns deal double damage and are 60x more accurate, you're gun consumes 2 from the mag for every one fired. Getting killed with any one gun always feels like ""that gun doesn't do that"" either doesn't have that many bullets, isn't that accurate, doesn't hit that hard, or a combination. Vehicles are the same. For all the AT running around it sure baffles me how tanks seem to always fk my day up, and the second I hop in one, the first guy I see nukes me into oblivion? Planes absolutely dunk on infantry, and whether it's because AA isn't real, or refresh rate is fkd, it sure as hell seems like planes are immortal, until of course you get one, and explode during the zoom in animation.

Oh, the squad res, and locked revives is pretty good, so it's one of the best battlefields on the market imo"

incredibly clunky aim mechanics. especially for controller players. I tried switching to keyboard and mouse and hated it lol. other than that the gameplay is dope.
Played my first game and ran into two hackers off the rip. I wish I could refund this game right now.
one of the worst battlefield

"Bad review for EA team
I was banned by red letter the day after I bought the game, saying that I violated the sales regulations. I failed to appeal twice, and was told that they could not tell me what regulations I violated. I bought a lot of games on my STEAM account, but I cannot unbind my EA account. Dear EA team, your mother is dead.

差评给EA团队

Doesen´t run well + that you have to install that EA crap that makes things even worse. Aint gonna play no more EA games.
honestly not that fun. Its the worst of the 3 I've played and its just BF1 but worse.
wont even start for me

Join a match of Breakthrough just for all the characters to look like they're part of a biker gang or circus, not an army.
Graphics somehow look *less* clear than Battlefield 1, especially the grass.
Then try to at least play Air Superiority only to find out it doesn't exist in this game.
THERE'S NOT EVEN AN AIR SUPERIORITY MODE IN THIS GAME

go play bf1 fuck this shit

"As a fan of WWII history, I was excited for Battlefield V, but the game is a massive letdown due to its blatant disregard for historical accuracy. Instead of delivering an immersive WWII experience, the game seems more focused on pushing modern political ideas, completely distorting real events.

The most obvious problem is the forced diversity in roles that simply didn’t exist during the war. Female soldiers on the frontlines, unrealistic customization options, and even prosthetic limbs that don’t belong in the 1940s take you right out of the experience. It feels like Battlefield V cares more about pandering than respecting the history it’s supposed to represent.

The Norwegian campaign, especially, is deeply disrespectful. “Tungtvannaksjonen at Rjukan” (Norwegian Heavy Water Raid), which was a critical mission carried out by Norwegian resistance fighters ""Kompani Linge"", is completely twisted. In the game, they replace the real heroes of the raid with a fictional female character. This erases the actual history and sacrifices of the men who risked their lives in that mission, just to fit a modern agenda. The operation cost a total of 91 human lives, while DICE & EA is more concerned about pandering to ""modern audiences"".

Even in multiplayer, the historical inaccuracies continue with unrealistic character designs that break immersion. Instead of honoring WWII, Battlefield V uses it as a backdrop for political statements, making it hard to enjoy for anyone who cares about the real history.

In the end, Battlefield V sacrifices authenticity for forced diversity, and it ends up disrespecting the people and events it should be honoring. If you're looking for a historically accurate WWII experience, this game isn’t worth your time."
"I have never been so frustrated with a campaign before. constant lag between missions regardless of the graphics quality, no aim assist, or ways to check on the mission even if I'm pressing the button saying it will.  Playing on Normal difficulty the enemies are tanky as heck 3-4 sniper shots to the leg and they're still alive. I would recommend casual players who like to play campaigns to stay away from this game."
"Like the game, but the game keeps on stopping when I open it, even after repair."
"the battlefield 1 is way better than this , nice graphics and details even stories , but the game play sucks . i just played couple of hours and returned to the masterpiece named battlefield 1"
"would be fine if not the blatant hacking and game breaking bugs, and massive random fps drops. texture popping and straight up Jank.

Not recommended even on discount, hell don't take it if they even offer it for free."
"Campaign was bad and multiplayer was alright, the graphics were awesome but not that awesome. Overall I loved bf4 more than bf5 in everyway"
"More COD than BF, shift to aesthetic purchase mode is tacky and takes away any possibility of immersion, doesn't feel like a battlefield game."
cant see shit in all the grass
Lousy fking game filled with hackers
"To play this game, I must download a new EA launcher and register an account, and I need to play it under the running of their launcher. The point is, they have a garbage launcher so the game keeps crashing when joining a multiple player match. Perfect game with a garbage launcher and terrible running program design."
"Too many effects, you can't see anything"
STUPID GAME CRASHING
"I took back my previous review.
the game is ruined by cheaters, there are cheaters everywhere, they are low profile as to only do wall, damage boost and building penetration, even on community sever they are unavoidable. however, it is quite obvious with their score. no reason to accuse them of cheating.
just quit the sever and join another sever or simply do like me, give this game a bad review and delete the game.
don't play this game in Asia, there are too many cheaters with no mother."
"Might be the most clunky dogshit game ever, terrible maps, horrible visibility and somehow the worst community ever. I don't suggest getting it even at sale. Get BF1 instead."
not noice
Unpatched connection bugs render this game unplayable 99% of the time.
"controls are garbage, feels like you're driving a boat even when infantry."
"Boring, Hyperbolically inaccurate
Kernel level Anti-Cheat"
"Just a shit show. I tried it during the beta and thought why not get it now during the sale. And after less than an hour of playtime I can tell you that it's a joke. I hopped into multiplayer to and I was surprised how bad the game was, and the agent customization made me feel like I'm playing Fortnite. 5 mins later I get killed ""redeployed"", and it happened several time in the span of 2 mins, maybe it's the admin balancing teams or something? So I changed servers and it happened again, apparently Hackers are out of control in this game and can just make the game unplayable (literally) for you. The exploit has been going around for more than a year without getting fixed."
Game is absolute dog water. Worse than Enlisted which says a lot.
"[h1] Battlefield V is a massive disappointment [/h1]

Battlefield V is a massive disappointment, not because of its core mechanics or graphics, but because of the rampant cheating that ruins the experience. Cheaters flood almost every match, using aim bots and wall hacks, making it impossible for regular players to enjoy the game. What’s worse is the absolute lack of response from DICE, the studio behind the game. Despite endless reports and community outcry, the developers have done little to nothing to combat this issue. Their anti-cheat system is laughably ineffective, and updates addressing the problem are almost nonexistent. The result is a game that's unplayable for anyone seeking a fair and competitive experience. Players who invested time and money are left feeling abandoned, as the studio seems more focused on cosmetic updates than fixing the actual game."
"Worst optimization ever, DX12 just keeps flashing"
"guys i already purchased this and refund it like 5 month ago, and now i buy it again but when i already pas i cant get the game why thoooo"
garbage game have to install ea just to play single player im glad i waited till it was super cheap. didnt waste too much money. now i know not to get anymore EA games. thank you for the learning experience
"It's nice. Never played a war FPS. But after the few hours you play the story and all is good. Then you go to multiplayer an you'll be overcome.

it's everywhere filled with cheater. Asian servers especially."
垃圾游戏。。。一堆bug，Z和C乱七八糟，蹲又不蹲的还得自己设置，望远镜缩放又缩放不了，一堆bug，能不能做好再拿出来卖。。。
"Battlefield V is developed by DICE and released in 2018.
This episode marks a return to World War II,
after years of modern warfare to copy the Call Of Duty games.

I'm not going to beat about the bush, I found the game abysmal, 
the single-player part at least.
BF5 has four distinct campaigns, each almost as bad as the next.

Billy Bridger is a former English delinquent who is as dumb as he looks.
In 1942, the army gives him a chance to redeem himself rather than rot in prison.
He has to fight the Afrikakorps in the deserts of North Africa, destroying as much of their equipment and vehicles as possible.
But the idiot can't even make bombs that work properly... 

Then, in 1943, we played Solveig Fia Bjørnstad, a woman of course, as Wokism dictates.
As well as being a real tomboy, the Norwegian woman fancies herself a strong woman but is totally devoid of charisma.
Mademoiselle will have to find her scientist mother, 
who is being held prisoner by the Germans,
and stop the export to Germany of heavy water used in atomic weapons research.
You can ski to get down the slopes faster! Isn't that great?!
And if the Germans don't manage to kill you, the freezing cold will!

Worse still, we play the role of a Senegalese Tirailleur named Deme Cisse in 1944 France.
In short, the black soldier and all his African companions must work to liberate France from the German yoke. 
As if it wasn't possible to play as an American or British soldier.
The developers couldn't give a damn about the French Resistance either.
It's probably more in tune with the times to have a black man killing white men.
This campaign is a disgrace from start to finish, a stain that tortures French history.

Finally, you play as Peter Müller, Commander of the Wehrmacht Tiger 237 tank crew.
In the ruins of 1945 Germany, you'll have to destroy American Sherman tanks, 
as well as other tanks and their infantry.
From time to time, you'll have to get out of the Panzer to shoot down planes with flak or recover important documents.
This campaign is quite great overall, but it's not enough to make BF5 a good game.
As someone who always wanted to play the Germans during WWII, 
it had to be in one of the worst games of its kind.

The characters are not at all endearing, in fact they quickly become irritating.
Fortunately, the single-player mode is fairly short, so you don't have to suffer for long. Thank goodness for that!

The staging is Hollywood-esque, with quality cinematics,
but the whole thing is weighed down by a stupid script, 
cringe-worthy narration and absurd situations... 
The pretty graphics and lighting effects, as well as the destructible sets, 
do nothing to change that.

The gameplay is very classic, 
and the weapons offer a pleasant shooting sensation despite the strange ballistics.
You'll need to destroy enemy vehicles and equipment,
drive different types of vehicles, including tanks, etc. 
Nothing really original.

Objectives are poorly indicated on the radar, 
and it's not immediately clear what you need to do.
The maps are huge, with very few objectives to complete.
I sometimes feel like I'm in a walking simulator, 
or being almsor alone in some insipid battle royale.
It's impossible to bend over without aiming,
health takes forever to regenerate, 
weapons are solw to reload... 
The AI is completely retarded, just like in Battlefield 4, 
probably to reflect the developers' lack of intelligence.
What would an EA game be without bugs?
Expect collision problems and enemies falling through walls!

Battlefield 5 is a total mess full of historical inaccuracies, even defecating on History.
EA has deigned to stuff it full of woke and cringe, so much so that the game seems to be at war with common sense.
How could anyone produce such a crap after the excellent Battlefield Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3 and Battlefield Hardline?
And what's more, it weighs in at 90GB! 
As soon as I finished the game, I uninstalled it, and I never want to hear about it again."
I play single player mode 3 times cuz it doesn't save the data every time I close this game. The bug does not fix after allowing this game to bypass the windows firewall. Dun wanna open this game again.
"I had the latest amd driver, but the game gives an amd drive 0.0.0 error"
"Game used to work perfectly fine in Steam Deck & Linux, now EA ticked a box and said 'no'.
Classic EA."
"It's full of hackers, micro-transactions. Hitreg is messed up don't even bother buying this trash."
worst bf ever
"6/10. the multiplayer is great but does have some issues, low score because the amount of historical inaccuracies, with the addition of a weak campaign kills BFV. graphics wise it looks great and runs smooth for me"
in almost every way inferior to battlefield 1
I do not recommend the story is weak and the gameplay is very weak
cant seem to play any games i bought anymore
"I love this game and the franchise. But the hacker issue and the way the publisher decided to cut funds instead of solving this issue seems rather unprofessional to me. Hence, I cannot recommend this game."
They changed their anti-cheat to one that does not support linux. can no longer play.
vehicles are OP and there is no cover in most multiplayer maps. and the hit registration still has not been fixed to this day haunting all battlefield games to this day.
keep crashing when join multiplayer server lol
get bf1 instead
外挂！！！
*UCKING DON;T MAKE A GAME IF U DON'T KNOW HOW TO  HANDEL CHEATERS.....GAME IS REALLY GOOD BUT CHEATERS ARE SPOILING THE FUN...EVEN THOUGH I BOUGHT GAME FOR 600 RS...STILL ITS WASTE OF MONEY BECAUSE OF ALL CHEATERS. DON'T WASTE MONEY LOL
shxt
"I have played it during months without a single issue, now EA decides to add its proprietary anti-cheat that will ultimately fail to solve cheating, but will succeed in preventing Linux and Steam Deck users from playing indefinitely.
Never support EA, they don't care about Linux or Steam Deck users."
"EA Splash screen, death to my fav jump-in jump-out game. d o g shit"
game keeps on crashing what can i do
"dont buy this game. too many hackers and ea wont do anything about it. even if you reported the hacker, it wont do anything. I absolutely smashed the report button so many time yet i found the same hackers for 4 games in a row without the hackers getting banned lmao"
Absolute dogshit
Not available for Steam's family sharing.
"I'm so tired of having Ubisoft and EA games in my library.

EVERY SINGLE TIME I try to play one of these games I need to install some kind of new launcher or anti-cheat and reset my password - but I can't because I've used all my passwords so I have to change it to something new I'm not going to remember and then go through this all over again the next time I play."
"Awful Game Do not waste your money you are welcome my friend, have a great day !"
"The matchmaking is non existent. You might think to yourself ""Oh hey, a round of a fun FPS sounds great!"" Until you join up with a bunch of basement dwelling no lifes that sink thousands of hours into this game and walk all over you. I just wanted to play a casual shooter, but nope, sniped from across the map right after spawning. Every. Single. Game. 3/10."
This game is so incredibly buggy it becomes almost unplayable. How long has this been out and it's still a mess? This is absolutely unacceptable for a supposedly AAA game.
"Hackers have ruined this game, EA's Anti cheat is stupid bad, and they dont plan on fixing it. Blatant Aimbot and server clearing happening, but reporting does nothing. Thanks EA."
"Denuvo anti-cheat ruined this experience, used to get 120 FPS constantly now I am sub-60 no matter what settings I have. Game ruined"
"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME

I have played this game for many years; it was good, but since the last update, every time I try to open the game, it says an unexpected error occurred, and the game simply won’t start. I’ve contacted EA customer support seven times, but not a single person could help me or provide a hotfix. So basically, I cannot play this game.

Side Note: I tried on my Windows 10 PC with another account and on this account using a Windows 11 PC that is connected via Steam and EA, whereas my other PC is connected only to the EA account.

ive spent hundreds of dollars on this game for cosmetics the fact i cannot even play or open the game i paid for is absolute BS Shame on the lazy devs for not coming up with a fix if the anti cheat is causing this remove it because its not even helping anyways"
Go buy battlefield 1
"i laughed until i cried, what a piece of shit. so bad lmfao"
No longer works on the steam deck.
SHI
TOO MANY HACKERS & CHEATERS & WALLER & MAGIC BULLET & EVERYTHING! ATMOSCHRONOZ IS THE ULTIMATE HACKER xD
SO MANY HACKER AND EA DID NOTHING!!!! NOTHING!!! I NEED A REFUND!
SO MANY HACKER!!!!
devs doesn't know how to stop hacker. no penalties and no action whatsoever.
"For people, who like shooting with each other outside is a very good game, But for me, it's not very good. I want some maps inside a house and to play without tanks, helicopters and so on... And weapon is not so good for me.

If you like shooting outside and capturing positions - you will like it (maybe)"
"Dogshit game, buggy multiplayer nothing but tank spam and explosions everywhere. Impossible to have a coordinated infantry squad."
What is the point of getting this game from steam when it still forces you to download an EA launcher for it...
"Better than BattleFailed 2042. Worse than a bucket of sh*it. 

-Progression is horrible, assignments and other unlocks are dumb and you have to master your weapon by completing stupid challenges countless times (by adding first omg) for each stupid iron sight colors. That's disgusting.

-After you die before you spawn its not going map overview, instead going somef*ucktards third person view and pressing spawn if its possible. You need to click overview by yourself if you want. So you can clearly see what your dumb cant see while you are ghost and this is killing game balance. Its like you have wallhack sometimes. Player is in combat my a*ss. 

-Weapons also garbage, equipment , one time use grenades, useless gadgets

-Vehicles are totally cancer. You can repair only once most of the time, you have very limited ammo and destroying or using planes-tanks are the worst thing in this game. Planes? Good luck handling them after you use extremely rare plane spawn. You will see the engine at least then 20 seconds you will spam the respawn button. AA guns are incredibly powerful you can not stand with them even when a 10 yold kid using them.
You can call me noob or something else, it wasn't like that in BF1. P.S. im bad on flying planes but not useless like this game.

-Optimization is good but why the f*uck im having stutters at every single map starts for a minute?

-Campaign is also dumb like any other BF games campaign

+There are good things too. Maps are amazing maybe the best in BF or even any other game history. Hit registration is fixed from previous game BF1, and graphics are really really good

Even with those good sides this game is total garbage, reviews are telling the truth. Go play BF1 its way better than this. Do not try, do not buy, forget about curiosity. Trust me its completely mess. If you are stupid, go and buy some BF Currencies for shiny skins and please play this game for loong loong time with lots of cheaters

3/10"
"All the American Guns are garbage. The spawning is horrific. What works for others, will more than likely not work for you. Packet loss out the ass. Everything from Dice after Bad Company 2 has been a total dumpster fire. Fuck this stupid ass, piece of shit, half witted folly of a game."
"BEWARE CHEATERS! 
Game itself is great but damn, cheaters are rife. They openly gloat as well, clearly no admins.
Pity - avoid."
una pija flacida
"so many cheaters on it, every single match!"
You shoot a tank four times with a rocket and nothing happens.
i keep getting stream sniped oh mah lawd hawnsty fix your game
Game was great but EA hates steam deck
stupid game
"Its a literal gamble if you enjoy this game. With half the maps being really unfun due to their design either empowering mmg players or snipers as there is huge sighlines without cover you will most certainly come to a point where a whole sector is locked down as trying to pass will just get you killed. The visual clutter in this game is awful that even with character lighting there will be points where seeing the enemy is impossible Vehicles in this game are oppressive, if you thought bf1 had some annoying vehicles this game has double that. Most tank players rather just snipe from across the map then push, and as most players don't play assault or do their job, not to mention any reliable anti-weapons require you to actually be close to the tank, you just have them rain supreme, however planes are much worse. if you ever just want to farm kills without the worry of death, planes are just for you, you'll notice that no one bothers to deal with them, infantry players would just ignore it and complain about it chat, other pilots on your team usually get destroyed as the other team just has a level 500 pilot dominating the server. Oh on the topic of level 500 players, the team balance in this game is dogwater, matches will derail to being taking turns steamrolling, as there is no auto balance, or option to switch team your just stuck being dominated by the other team just being higher skill. Gun play coinflip, will you laser beam your opponent or will you miss enough shots to die to the enemy. Weapon balance is eh most weapons are kinda trash with a few selected raining supreme, you can expect to see people running the same type of guns and only switching based on the maps. The attrition system is god awful, you will run out of ammo, gernades, and gadgets all lot of the time, when you can really use them, By increasing the amount of teamwork need you really limit what a single person can do. which just makes the other problem mention above worse, and in this game I have not seen an increase of team work, support players will either by mmgs players or will be running around for kills then dropping an ammo crate or ammo bags, medics will either help the revieve the team or will play for kills. There are some things I like about the game like squad revives, the movement, fortifications, and the last tiger campaign mission, but besides that its really hard to enjoy it. This game has things that make me really enjoy this game, but the issues that plague this game really make it hard to comeback to it."
new update blocked linux support...
what a trash game dont buy you would have more fun getting you hand caught in a car window going up
"Just not worth playing. It looks great, runs well, and still has an active population. However the gameplay is unfun, servers tend to just be single team stacks, and hackers are rampant."
filled with cheaters maybe worth 50 cents
battlefield 1 is still better
"Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: EA online activation and EA app software installation and background use required. <----------------------------------------------

for have this transparency we waited 6 YEARS, and now they tell us they are spy us + let trash on or pc, NEVER AGAIN.

invasive, 30gb JUST IN ANTICHEAT ( game is 50gb relase date ) , spy each time u play + we all know what happens to APEX pro players, and this anticheat is the same one, so probraly u have some random spy instaled on the pc if u have this game instaled, this deserves a fullrefound"
Can't even launch the game anymore after DICE fucked something up in the most recent update. Can't play a game I paid for.
cant sex the guns :(
"The campaign is not enjoyable. Battlefield is known for its beauty and this game doesn't have it. Every single cut scene rubber bands like crazy and gives me motion sickness. You physically can not watch it. Then, certain key parts of the map won't let you pass. I.e. at the beginning of the second ""phase,"" you have to prone under a rock and I got stuck there for 10 minutes. I tried running to slide, prone, everything. Eventually I got past it by holding the forward button for 2 minutes until it eventually squeezed in. Multiplayer is OK but GOD is this player base sweaty."
I can't even play this game for a second!!! fix your game
"I saw a player using hack,"
THIS IS STUPID GAME ITS HARD TO OPEN THIS GAME !!!!
"Game is worse than most make it out to be. Visuals, audio, and the overall atmosphere are incredibly realistic. However, this is where the praise ends. The game runs fine in-game without latency, but has long loading times (somehow still in 2024). The playerbase either runs around mindlessly, camps, or cheats (which the anti-cheat does nothing to solve). Although the server sizes are large, the maps also seem too large and you'll find yourself running around just to find an enemy player. In conclusion, Battlefield 1 better."
This horrible game cannot save my progress i literally have completed intro TWICE AND IT  just doesnt save and i have to play that intro over and over again. Horrible game. Worst gaming exp i`ve ever had. Complete garbage.
too many cheaters.... typical dice do nothing.. uninstalled
64 vs 64. Still cannot find any enemies only way to get any kills is to camp with a fking sniper. Do not recommend at all wish they made it more 'confined' if it makes any sense
"Played Battlefield 2 and Bad company 2 and though this would be a good addition so I grabbed it. Played my way through the majority of the campaign (apart from the tank bit, because why lol) and had a reasonable time. Just reinstalled the game to test some new hardware and I find that I have to have an EA app now, which I don't need or want on my pc. After about ten minutes of the launcher and steam working together to try and launch the game I got in, just in time to sit through a five minute cut scene. After this cut scene, I was brought back to the main menu, where i tried to play the same campaign only to have the same cut scene re play. At that point I alt F4'd, and will now be removing the game.

It ran poorly on my rig when I played it last, and to be honest there's no reason for me to play this game now. Would have been a lot better if EA had never gotten involved but here we are. Dont buy it at this point, I paid somewhere around £50 and now it can be had for £5 on sale."
FUCK EA do not get if u have a AMD card for some random reason it can use your integrated graphics card not your main and will not lunch.
"Due to no linux support at all, i can in no way recommend this. I'm all for messing up cheaters days, but not at the cost of those of us that simply want nothing to do with windows..."
Why the hell can't I choose my team? Why do I have to play as an Englishman?
Great Game but Fuck EA Launchers
"can't hit 60 fps, stalls for like five minutes on startup and return to main menu, menu buttons take forever to respond, basically a virus but that's an EA published title for you"
I can't turn on the game anymore due to this new shitty EA app that they introduced. Do not buy this game unless you want to wait AN ENTIRE DAY for it to launch.
Soylords at EA added some garbage anticheat 6 years after release that stops Linux players from launching the game they paid for.
нет hardcore режима
"meh
campaign didn't intrigue me like many others. multiplayer isn't that fun either"
"The campaign is super short, sometimes makes no sense at all, and the gameplay is getting old and a bit boring.
On top of it, there is of course the politically oriented content that will make you feel bad during your few hours of free time. Always a pleasure. 
The visuals and graphics are, as usual with DICE and Frostbite, absolutely insane. But it doesn't make the game worth it in my opinion. Save some time, play something better."
"hackers enjoi 
dog shit match making"
"An invasive anti-cheat that doesn't solves the cheating problem and at the same time prohibits systems running Proton from launching the game. 
Can neither play or refund it. 
Paying for games seems like a huge L these days."
fix anti cheat and let mods work
"Do you love glitches? Do you like seeing floating objects and enemies moonwalking through walls? How about enemy AI that feels right at home in Goldeneye 64? Or maybe your thing is literally the worst hitboxes I've ever seen in a game. If you like playing half baked games which were never finished then Battlefield 5 is for you.

Now that I've finished the game I can honestly say I wish I hadn't. The game isn't fun at all. The writing was so insanely bad I can't believe the writers graduated middle school. All the dialogue were tropes and the names of each character have been used over and over again in other war games. They should never be allowed to write again. Do not play this game under any circumstance."
"crappy game but fun. sniper dont kill from one tap, tanks and planes have no realism when it comes to hit damage. plane can take 5 - 10 shots frontally and still survive when they should take 1 or 2 shots. similar with tanks have funny looking health bar . overall game shit. if you looking for true battle sandbox this game aint it. unless you play without vehicles."
I literally can't see stuff with those lights and smoke.
"This game is the worst in the franchise, yes worst than 2042, most unbalanced piece of garbage ive ever had the displeasure of playing, its not even worth $5 or even less, hell even if it was a free game its still not worth playing, save your money for a better game."
"BE PREPARED! spawn trapping by the ism is bound to happen. Not to mention you legit start off with an unfair k/d from the start up.... NOT GIVING YOU TIME TO LEARN CONTROLS. In general avoid this dumpster fire of ism where people have ""fun"" spawn locking for the 100th game in a row"
"I think battlefield 1 is better, in this game it feels like your running around looking for people to shoot, while in BF1 (at least in operations mode) it feels like there are actual frontlines"
Keep trying to come back cause the gameplay is really solid but the cosmetics are stupid and bother me a lot
The game is infected with WOKE. The game dislikes native europe people.
"TO MANY CHEATER IN THIS GAME, I CANT PLAY ENJOYABLE"
Hackers Hackers everywhere
"Эта игра шутка? Какого хуя она при наличии двух мониторов скачет то на один, то на другой, при этом постоянно перезапускаясь. Ебаный ЕА, расформируйте дайс и наймите нормальных программистов, а не дауничей с тремя классами образования (зрителей папича)"
dont buy this stupid fucking game its not worth it ea pos
EA Virus
"> adds shitty ea KERNEL LEVEL ANTI CHEAT
> Makes the game unplayable on Linux (which i use)
> Still has insane amount of cheaters

worthless company"
i genuinely hate this game
"Cannot be played while playing, 
what's the solution?"
"uneducated developers, they should have fix all that bugs"
Trash EA launcher. Doesn't show friends online so can't play together.
Unplayable unlike Battlefield 1.
"campaign is really really short. the new games are just a money grab for online gamers.
As far as enjoying a game in solo mode i think battlefield 4 was the last worth wile game"
"Even in 2024, this game continues to crash repeatedly."
If your half decent at the game it doesnt matter becasue all your teamates will be shite
game sux
"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A AMD CARD IT WILL JUST CRASH WHEN YOU USE THE M3 SNIPER NEVER BEEN FIXED

Used a 1080ti with no problem before have now a  AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX"
"good, but to many cheaters"
shit buggin
Fuck vehicles
ps4 have auto aim and no recoil fuck this rules
"plaah, almost the worst game ever."
"Battlefield V is a beautiful game with some interresting game mechanics that show great potential,I especially like the building mechanic in this title,while it’s more of a gimmick it give the players new ways to change the map dynamic rather than the standard objects destruction we seen in previous title,giving the entire game a more unique feeling.The movement and overall gameplay are also very good,the tanks customization are a welcome addition,we finally a more in-depth tank levelling system that is more akin to the guns customization we been seeing over the previous title.

Unfortunately,this game happens to be the most barebone World War II game I have ever seen,only four factions (Imperial Japan is added after the launch through the Tides of War live service) in the game with the ENTIRE eastern front missing.Congrats to EA making the first ever WW2 games that doesn’t have Soviet Union,eastern front and D-Day.Content wise is a big stepped down from Battlefield 1 which I adore.The lack of good anti-cheat also means the game is filled with cheaters,it’s almost unplayable in any servers that don't have admin.

But the main reasons it flopped miserably in my opinion,is definitely how EA handle the early controversy,release a half  complete product and attempt to fix it thought live service(which I think the video game community as a whole should reject)and worse of all,EA pull the plug the moment it doesn’t make enough money.

Overall the game has lots of potential to be a great fast paced WW2 theme shooter,if it weren’t for EA's terrible decision and it’s insatiable appetite for money.If you really want to play,buy it on sale.This will most likely be the last Battlefield game I will purchase."
"Battlefield 1 was truly your last breath before you perished, eh? Bought on sale for $5 and still feel ripped off. Unfortunately there are only so many progression-based multiplayer FPS games.
DICE, I just graduated and have no experience. In other words, I'd be a great addition to your development team and would fit right in. Also, please hire an actual art team for the microtransactions if you're gonna sell them for real money. They're almost as bad as the movement system in the game."
"This game is aids. How can a multi billion $ company have such shitty controls and bugs in a game. To whomever was responsible for that, please never program anything again. 


The multiplayer is even worse somehow. Unbalanced maps, shit weapon system, boring gameplay. Probably the only game where killing your enemy feels boring. 

I got this game for 1 buck on sale but anything more than that is basically a scam."
"playing halfway in the game the whole team doing good, squad mates following command orders, waiting for each other to respawn so we don't get squad wiped then all of the sudden you get disconnected from the match for no apparent reason it, well you could say ""oh just find another match easy"" but the immersion from the previous match you got just banishes from your sight. and it happens all the time i have a stable 30 ms from asia server and the other complaint i got is cheaters are still rampart even with the anti-cheat that got introduced last april 2024 even on community servers idk if its the cheater's thing that they can boot you out of the match. The singleplayer part is amazing no problem there, the music (especially the flute theme in the menu), atmosphere, graphics 10/10"
was great but the EA launcher don't work anymore for any EA games.
"If you want to die every 5 seconds to the tank,plane or a sniper play this bs"
fails to load.....preparing game then nothing.
game is inspired from ww2 not based on ww2
"I heard this game was bad, but I did not know how bad it was until i played it. It is like they took all the negative aspects of Hard Line, and BF1, then they doubled down on it. Most of the missions want you to sneak around like it is a stealth game. It is also filled with bugs. You can not hold more than 2 buttons down at a time. Enemies can take 3 sniper rounds to the head and still live. The guns are not accurate and then they are. You can not walk over a stick or a rock, but then you can. You can not shoot certain things enemies because there is an invisible wall protecting them. Enemies know they have cover because your view is obstructed by a leaf. Also the bug where you pick up a weapon and then you can not use or switch between any guns without reloading the game. When you are in a Tank and want to repair but there is a cool down and the repair stops when you are hit by a bullet. Not taking any damage, just being hit. At least I hope there is a cool down, because the repair just would not engage. I died more in this game to the BS and bugs the creators left in. All this in addition to the re-imagined alternate history of WW2 made this game horrible. It looks nice, but I think that is all the developers cared about."
"To start off its unplayable it messes with my second monitor that has important shit on there. and The game flickers and lags (I fixed it by changing the default settings.) shouldn't have to change a thing if your game is decent enough anyways. I started loading into the game for the first time and saw a women on the front of it, I thought this was a game based on history of WWII the halo sights are weird as well."
"Fucking retarded game developers cannot make a single game to run without issues. I am literally spending every 10mins at each game start to watch stupid pre-game video because it thinks I a new player. Surprisingly, after I quit the demo-version - it goes back to normal and access my account. Fucking EA, hire normal developers!!!!"
"woke EA games and their security team have taken a money first approach to Battlefield games. During gameplay typing aimbot, cheating and hacking is censored. Pretty sus. If you post to admin forums with videos you get banned for a week. Psychotic injustice there. EA objective is keep receiving money from hacking players. The point, perform periodic bans for kpi, wait for cheaters to come in with new accounts, therefore spending money on purchasing the game again. It's an effective loop cycle that maintains income. 

EA does not care about its consumer base. Everyone knows EAs reputation. They just stay quiet and hide hoping consumers will forget. My honest review is 5 stars for this game. From cinematics, server performance, time and detail spent from 3d animation crew. The maps are beautiful, their frost engine works great for environment weather simulation. The gigantic let down is the abundance of hackers/cheaters per game. Averages between 4-6 per game for me with all different names. If you play each day for a week you will definitely see between 30-50 new names. I love this game, im a very competitive player. But i cannot support a game and franchise that openly silences players that report hackers and does nothing about the hackers accounts. Youll see them on the next day or the next week. Its ethically bad, there's poor integrity and poor transparency with admins, and security team. 

I know its a huge hit to finance to investigate cheaters but youll save money legally going after known cheater websites."
bad
"EA has done it again, this game is complete ass. from the woke characters that were not realistic to the time, to the shit gun play. All guns have massive recoil and i cant seem to kill anyone in one shot but i die almost everytime to being one shot. fuck this game EA is a gay loving company fuck you"
"The battlefield franchise has really taken a dive and this is a prime example of it. The campaign is horrendous and you can't wait to skip the long boring cut scenes. Gameplay is clunky and shooting is inconsistent. I won't even tell you how terrible the online match making is.
Garbage franchise gone down the drain ."
"el juego de por sí funciona de manera extraña de a ratos. ahora no puedo iniciarlo porque dice que ya lo estoy ejecutando, reinicio la PC, desinstalé el juego pero sigue sucediendo el mismo error."
So much wokeness and DEI. Pretty sure all male DICE devs have permanent flaccid weeners and female DICE devs weigh like a whale.
Too many hackers in SEA server.
AntiCheat always broken im already install and uninstall it and nothing happend EA Trash
Bad maps bad aiming clunky movement boring experience
"Zero balance, game pairs teams full of beginners against max level clans"
"Stupid game should not be this hard to just open the game and have fun.

I have a problem with the intro missions always playing again and again and my setting always getting deleted when i close the game and open it again. On console i had 300 hours or so and was lvl 120 or something. And in those 300 hours i have recived less brain damage then in these 3 hours i have tried to fix my issue. Propably would have more fun playing battlefield 2042 with a power drill drilling through my forehead while playing the a game that i bought that dosent even work."
Crash serveral times for no reason
fix the fucking snipers
Feels like a big step down from BF1
EA is suck. also chinese.
"I originally bought this game when it first came out and didn't like it. I came back to it thinking that in its early release that it was just unpolished. That's not the case. Where to start? First off, everything feels like a nerf. From the anti-tank weapons to the guns themselves. Battlefield 1 had a very defined set of guns for each class where this isn't the case except for the support and recon classes. The weapons don't feel good to use, feels like they shoot confetti in the wind. The medic tools are slow to use and overly clunky. I can't tell you how many times I got shot in the head trying to revive fallen allies. The spotting system was almost entirely dismantled except for the recon classes, so I can't point out the sniper that's camping in a building. The tanks encourage camping on points, which goes back to the nerf in anti-tank weapons.  Ultimately, this game is half baked and poorly balanced. 1/10 for a Battlefield game."
there is no auto balance for the teams. DISGUSTING
Steam installed game crashes PC on exiting just like Battlefield 2042. EA  installed game does not crash on exiting.
Hackers are a problem.
Battlefield 1 was gold. This is mud.
game is full of cheaters mostly on and off
No USSR in a WW2 game.
Game keeps crashing checked online and only thing I could fine was that EA's anti-cheat is detecting something Msi center does as suspicious and immediately closes out the game as soon as I get into a match. Tried disabling Msi center and didn't work. Same thing happened to me in battlefield 1 to.
1/10
I loved BF1 because of the true story and full multiplayer gameplay specially soundtracks they were awesome and... so much but what happend to bfv wrong story The WW2 and 1 is famous because of story and events of Men of war but you destroy it with LGBT and Femenists nice! only multiplayer is a little entertaining after that 2042 completely fucked the game franchise suggest to don't make any more games EA your retarded that's all.
Game wont even let me disable HDR... so frustrating to repeat the intro part over and over again....
"Really, Really frustrating. How you can go from the brilliant smooth game-play of the WW1 Battlefield to this glitchy bullshit mess I have no idea. Every gun takes ridiculous amounts of time to reload it seems like you are CONSTANTLY reloading no matter what gun you choose and disarm prompts on the alarms just show up whenever they feel like. I fully understand why this game was so hated. Bought it literally for a couple bucks and was so mad I rage quit in the single player."
"Just like its predecessor, this game's single player campaign is extremely disappointing.
It's riddled with game-breaking bugs, which will never be fixed.
Additionally, the performance is lacking. There are occasional freezes and FPS drops, even on the best hardware.
Finally, the gameplay itself has many questionable mechanics. It's like the developers were experimenting with them, but in fact they were just lazy.

Many mechanics, like picking up weapons and ammunition, were perfected over the years in similar games. Yet in this game it feels like we're back to 1990 and the devs are pioneering the field with clunky and silly mechanics. So even when the game does work, it's just kinda unpleasant and doesn't provide the satisfaction  you'd expect from such a game.

The enemy AI is really weird. Sometimes they'll notice you from extreme distances while you're crawling in the bushes and start shooting at you. Since then every other enemy will always know where you are and be aiming at your position, even if you are covered. On other times you might spring through the enemies and they wouldn't notice you. Or you'd pick a loud fight with a group of enemies, and another, nearby group would completely ignore the noise.

The equipment management is also weird and often buggy.
If you find the same weapon that you already have. The two weapons won't share ammunition, despite being the same exact gun. Sometimes you may pick up the same gun twice and get stuck with only being able to use one.

There are many more quirks in this game. Generally, just don't buy it. Even when it's on sale."
Filled with hackers and report doesn't even work. Stupid game
"nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope"
POS WASTE OF MONEY
"Is this game worth buying in 2024? simple answer is no. the only active game mode is tactical conquest every other game mode is empty and you'll never find players in, so unless you REALLY enjoy that game mode then go for it and get the game. The game is really fun and i enjoy playing it but there's no player base anymore. i have seen a lot of people not recommending the game because there's hackers but personally i have yet to see any. my review would be way different if i were to play the game on launch, i would probably be playing this game non stop..."
"[h1] If you buy this game, be prepared to not be able to open it most of the time [/h1]
As simple as that. The same bug happens to my friends. 
[b] Do not buy this game until the bug is fixed. [/b]"
"The game is well made, but the EA publishers ruin the whole game. Can't even start it without brainfucking myself"
"This game has lots of 7 years players with aimbot wallhacking that still not getting banned , the anticheat in this game is so.. is there any ? not really working . others game were actually good with kicking all the cheating players in their fps game . if im gonna rate , it will be 0.5/10 game experience ."
"Dogshit optimization, DXR doesnt work, DLSS doesnt work. Imagine buying this dogshit game and struggles to get even 60fps Cant even customize ray tracing or DLSS settings. Game looks exactly the same as BF1 but cant run even half as decent. What a failure."
"If this was 100% on steam platform and not requires you to go through an EA app, all will be good. Because the EA app always crashes out of the blue and when you try to launch the game normally, you will run into 101 problems which gets fixed when you uninstall EA app and launch it through steam. DO BETTER EA."
no
"Iam writing this review as the game is running its curscene in the background. For the 4th time now.
This... game.. gives you a PROFSAVE_tmp for your settings which actually needs to be PROFSAVE.
That means the starting cutscene, tutorial and all your settings will have to be redone every time you launch this garbage.
I must say, this is a first for me. I have seen thousands of games and all of them at least managed to save my settings. Whats even worse is you had 6 years to fix this, and you didnt. At this point it would be faster to teach an earthworm how to rename the file and upload the patch.
This is the second time Iam trying this game and the most challenging part is getting it to work,"
have so many crashes
"It takes a hundred years to find a match, and once you are in a game, the teams aren't balanced. Overall, it's very boring and a waste of money at this point in the game's life."
game is dead and a money grab BF5 is not a Battlefield not even worth the sale price
"I bought the game and played it for less than two hours. The game experience was extremely poor. I was obviously very good. I just finished the beginner's tutorial and started two games without cheating. The game official banned me directly, but the feedback was still not lifted. I suspect that the official discriminates against Chinese people. I strongly recommend players not to play their games because they are too deceitful"
just add anti cheat
"Everytime there is a hacker, and its ruining the game for everyone and getting too much annoyed. Fix your game, it will be more better"
Game is dead as hell and plays like ass. Stay away.
"I have to launch the game as an admin directly from the folder, after that I click the play button only to be greeted with the game crashing. Suck my balls EA."

No I do not have ANY cheat software. No I can not play the game because I have cheat software."
"The game itself is good but  there is NO USSR
And no cross saving so all the hundreds hours on console are wasted."
😡😡😡😡😡😡The hacker ruined the game 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
No.
"Crashes after startup, tried contacting EA but support was of no help at all.

Super creepy seeing EA Desktop App can't be uninstalled like other normal apps, have to go tru REGEDIT which is insane. EA Desktop app should be considered a Malware just because of this."
TOO MANY NOOB CHEATER
"Why I wish I should have never purchased pathetic excuse for a game;

-Got released in 2018, no vs bots support despite the high demand from many players. However, they added it in BF2042. They added a co-op mode which you never get matched with other players, so it's just you and the whole army against you.

-The servers are dead, you get to wait over a minute for the matchmaking and then you get to have to wait as soon as you're matched so the game finds more players to begin the match.

-The servers are infested of toxic players; campers, trolls and try-hards. For example, the guy is God level in game but trolling and dominating lower ranked players.

-This game makes you face players who are 100x more experienced, more skilled, powerful opponents. You get in the match and see your team is formed up with newbies just like you but when you take a look at the opponent's team, they're all maxed out and ready to be  your worst nightmare.

-This game does not allow progress because opponents are too challenging to face; it's extremely difficult to fit in if you're a new player to Battlefield V, it's impossible to fit in and catch up with what is going on if you're completely new to Battlefield.

I encourage players to think three times before buying. I have no idea how it got mostly positive rating by players.

Pros;
-Breathtaking visuals
-Incredibly realistic game mechanics (destruction etc)
-So many details that make the game even more realistic
-Perfectly optimized, a medium end PC should be able to run this"
"Absolute dogshit, bunch of bugs and in general is not fun with the enemys being able to take sniper rifles to the head, and when i shoot a sniper rifle at their chest/heart its as if a blade of grass touched them. DO NOT PLAY IT"
"Easily one of the worst games ever made.  Woke garbage to say the least, but it gets a solid -4/10  You couldnt pay me to play this trash."
"A lot of bugs in every single game mode. Yes, there are cheaters. Also there is low online for some game mods. And I even didn't say about plenties of minor bugs.

For those who wants to get achievments - you will be very upset with this game. I've completed every story on the hardest difficulty twice and no one of the 3 achievments (for completing on medium, hard and hardcore) appears.

Overall, for $5 on sale it's okay, but it would be a way better if devs cared about their games."
"Game of shit ( as other BF series ).
Every 30 seconds disconnect from the game with no recconect button.
Was try all of these games and stil shit.
Reddit guys didn't help and told, that is server side problem, so please do not buy dat game!"
"The reviews about cheaters are not lying, it ruins it"
"dont buy this game even on sale , this is an abandoned stuttery piece of garbage game"
"This game fucking SUCKS. Its so bad i regret giving away 5 DOLLARS to play this incomprehensible, shit-steaming, fucked up nightmare of a game. The game is full of cheaters, server admins team stack which is, moving all the high rank players to their side so it becomes a one sided gang-rape for the opposing team, bullets pass STRAIGHT through solid objects 90% of the time, so cover is useless. The cosmetics are, well, do i even have to say anything?? Shotguns feel like i'm slapping my tip across someones face. SMG's, holy SHIT is the recoil fucking horrendous when you first use them. Sniping, if you're new don't even bother with it cuz you're gonna get smoked ALL the time. Most of the maps promote sniping because of the wide open terrain, the only fun ive had is on the urban ones where i don't get smoked light years across the map. I would honestly rather have a 450 lb dominatrix body slam me into a bed of nails while im naked than play this game, for the love of GOD, PLEASE do NOT buy this game, you will regret the 8 dollars you spent and jeez, if you're dumb enough to pay full price, may god have mercy on your keyboard."
"You buy game can t play multiplayer its locked like i am banned.
(Missing online access)"
"Playing BFV after BF1 is such a whiplash. They somehow fucked up every single thing that made BF1 great and then some. I have well over 400 hours in BF1 on Origin, here I lasted merely 7 (4 of which is the campaign), If I had to pick this game's greatest sin it would be that they somehow made using MP40 unfun."
this game have many shit map how the hell i have to fight 3 plane full bom with 1 spaa gun shit ???? all the map just have 1 shit spaa gun
"Game seems fine but it keeps crashing EA app is gay as fk, ..
hate that sht, .."
"I dont like it, fortunately I can refund it"
if you like getting shotgunned its fun ig
full of hackers
EA = ROUGH
"Such wasted potential, I originally played this game on gamepass and i was very annoyed and dissapointed when i loaded into the german campaign and saw a dumbass iron cross instead of a swastika. You can't call it a WW2 game if it doesn't have that, even more annoying is the fact that the USSR isn't in it either. What's up with that? the game just feels like a watered down family friendly WW2 alternate version. FUCK YOU EA. 

I have no doubt the multiplayer is good judging from these good reviews on it however you shouldn't be playing battlefield if you don't play the campaigns, It's such a soulless game without these crucial historical elements to make it an actual WW2 game. 

It's a very inauthentic experience as a ""WW2"" game, not to mention the slimy graphics that make the game look PG 13, if it's gonna be a WW2 game make it look gritty and gruesome, not some fortnite like graphics. 

Why couldn't EA have made the game like BF1 and added on from there? keep the same grittyness and excellent story telling as before but as a HISTORICALLY ACCURATE WW2 GAME.

you can barely call it a WW2 if it doesn't have the eastern front.

FUCK YOU DICE AND FUCK YOU EA"
No eastern front
Literally unplayable
This game is a lot like modern warfare. You're just gonna die a lot and deal with toxic players. Cool looking game but it's probably not worth the time.
bad gem
full of cheaters!
"don't bother doesn't work, just like all the crap that makes you use the EA app ,games just don't launch or play through it at all ,ive tried both this and battlefield 1 revolution and they don't work ,EA app is broken as shit"
"lmao EA is literally the worst gaming company second to none, not even one of their games is worth $5 much less the stupid AAAA price point, truly this company destroyus each and every franchise they have ever, are, and will touch, leaving them barren for the fans"
"theres supposedly a practice range but there isnt really, there are literally zero targets to shoot and the map size is the size of a large house

game is also absolutely full of cheaters

the game will also sometimes crash your computer after exiting"
somehow still terrible 6 years later dont fall into the trap of spending the $8
ww2 game and the ссср is not there
battlefield FIVE? more like i'm going to battlefield DIVE off the roof onto the pavement below after playing this game.
broke linux support with a shitty anticheat that doesnt work lmao
Guys do you have a solution for getting Crashed in the middle of the game. That happens to me when I play online modes. The only mode that I can play is story mode. and it doesn't crash.
having to install a second launcher to play the game is ridiculous
game didn't start up until randomly 3 hrs later and The first war story can't be completed
Too many bugs that have not been fixed.
Removed the map and locking thoes gunes i used + The enemy can pick tanks but my team can't. WTF are you idiots doing to the game. Not comeing back to this platform again. Minecraft is much better right now frr.
"Cannot recommend this game seeing as I can't even get past the launching screen and it then closing. Oh well, refunded I guess."
It makes no sense
Full of hackers and no one is banning them even after reporting
"uses kernel level anticheat so no longer works on linux/proton, yes it was unofficially supported but thats besides the point, they knew about linux players and still switched to a kernel level and there is still cheaters so nothing has improved :D

Never buying a multiplayer game from EA ever again until they decide to wake up"
This is worse in literally every conceivable way than Battlefield 1. I regret wasting my $3.50 on this.
Anticheat won't launch
"Every second I spent playing this game was actually painful. Horrible controls, gunplay feels off, consistent performance issues and frame drops, the revive system gives me motion sickness constantly, the menus are clunky and terrible, even spawning feels horrible because of the insane distance it puts you from the objective you want to be next to. It feels like it's trying to be BF4 and BF1 at the same time but playing this makes me want to go with either of them instead of this mess."
"For me, the best battlefield of the past 7/8 years, sadly, in 2024, it is fully packed of cheaters, you spawn, you die without even being hit by a bullet/missile or anything else, you die without losing health, some of them cheaters even teleport, others simple use aimbot, it is sad to see the most active game in the whole franchise, not receiving the proper love it deserves from the devs, DICE simply does not care, what a shame. When a lobby has no cheaters, it truly is a magnificent experience, from the atmosphere, the visuals, the audio... everything feels like you're in a WW2 movie, a shame.
You are not able to kick players and you cant report them, 2 simple features of any online multiplayer game, i think that says it all about DICE, right? Anyways."
game is absolutely brillant love it but has been ruined in recent anticheat update and will no longer go past the lauch screen wouldnt recommend buying until its fixed
no

never play it on a gaming laptop
"EA sucks, their app sucks even more, don't play unless you are looking for hours upon hours of troubleshooting"
Battlefield 1 but bad
No anti cheat? hackers in every room
"The EA logon window is confusing and difficult to navigate.
Additionally, the game is frequently unable to launch, resulting in a frustrating user experience."
Id refund the game if I could and buy a second copy of BF1 if I could.
"Bad, full of sweats, quite unbalanced"
it sucks
.
Smoke screen simulator filled with wall hacking cheaters.
"I really like the campaign, but it runs like shit regardless of settings, rendering it pretty much unplayable. About 10 fps when nothing is going on, and 3 in combat."
"Battlefield 1 > Battlefield 5

Plus the EA launcher sucks shit through a bendy straw"
"shoot, lag, die."
"dog shit game wont even start up. crashes instantly on main menu. Reinstalled multiple times. tried everything, spent days trying to play this shit made game. save your money and dont support these greedy fuckin cunts"
ea launcher won’t even let me play the game half the time…
"I'm just gonna say that I have seen a lot of cheaters in this game even after just buying this, either a teammate or at the enemy. It destroys the gameplay and is really bad when you just want to enjoy your game and have a little fun. Hopefully they can fix that issue. Even after reporting the player multiple times they are still not banned and still ruins the fun."
"The hackers have really made it pretty unfun to play. Aimbots are frequent and obvious without any real way to report them. Last night, I had a hacker ruin a server for everyone. The base game underneath is amazing, but without the technical support, the game has become a cesspool of cheaters."
Single player content is dismally short
ass
snipers and campers dominate this game
Your fking ea anti cheat prevents the common players
"idk what happened its suddenly unplayable due to frame drops and stuttering, dx11 or dx12 doesn't matter"
"Not a bad game, but cheaters ruin it for me. And yes, there are a lot of cheaters."
tigers with auto loaders iv seen it all now
"Why do this have pos reviews, I surely am not that blind to the point of not seeing anyone even close combat due to the awful contrast/brightness"
I love battlefield games.. but every damn one is full of cheaters that ruin the fun for everyone. EA also doesn't put forth the effort to help. I can not recommend the game for the said price because of this.
They changed the anti-cheat to be incompatible with Proton.
play battlefield 1 instead
they changed there anti cheat so you cant play on the steam deck anymore.
Dirty Chinese cheaters
"EA launcher is bloatware that takes roughly a century to launch.

Some of the worst menus I have ever had the misfortune to navigate.

Has the Bluetooth audio problem - easy enough to fix, but always a pain and just should not be happening.

I hope you're not in a hurry when trying to quit - it will take at least 5minutes to return you to the main menu and another 5 to reach the desktop.

I paid about 2euros for this garbage and I still feel ripped off.  Abysmal on all fronts."
"One of the worst games i've played, story was kinda cool, but every mechanic in the game is almost as busted as they come. Very little attention to detail, lots of recycled textures for things, ai is broken, the cut scenes glitch out, the lighting is poor, the way ai respawn is poor design, the ai themselves operate on a very low low iq level and i havnt even played multi-player and i already dislike the game. i see why it was 5$."
Fuck horrible game
meh
"I want to like the game so much. However, the spawn camping and overwhelming inability to have any effect at all because I keep getting put on teams that think they are playing Peppa Pig.... just kinda kills it for me. It's too bad they don't have any semblance of SBMM. I (someone completely new to the game) load into a game with starter everything and then spend the rest of the match getting absolutely smacked. Lame"
"i think i need to get good but i never seem to be able to do anything anymore. it does have its moments though, but i'd only nab it on a heavy sale"
"BF 1 was way better. World War II, and no USSR????"
"cool concepts. but this game has been released for 6 years and there's still many bugs even on the story mode. 

good graphics, story. but lack execution."
EA launcher devs I hope you kill yourself and your family die in the most painful way
"I'm not sure what it is but I just don't like this game.. feels slow and idk.. 
I wouldnt recommend it myself but I see why people can like It.."
i truly wish the worst for electronic arts🙏
Bullshit
Is not good
always force close .......
faggot
This is one of the worst battlefield and FPS games I have EVER played. DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE
"GODD I CANT EXPRESS MY HATE FOR THIS, EA LAUNCHER IS LITERAL POO,  PLS DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS, UNINSTALL IT, SSHIT KEEP CRASHING!!!!!!"
I paid $3.50 for this trash on sale and it wasn't worth the time it took to download.
"i really cant recommend, i might just be bitch made, but battlefield hasnt been fun for a long time, last time i enjoyed the game was bf4, every game after it feels just so ass and i cant place my finger on why"
"So many issues running; does not want to run, once running the graphics appear much whiter than how it is supposed to be, the socials were not working, and more"
"Quite enjoyable for the sale price of $5 CAD, although the separate launcher tends to cause a lot of issues and will often refuse to boot the game if there is an EA service still running in the background. Only way I've been able to get around this is to open task manager, scroll through the services and terminate any EA related one."
"This game is just mid. Campaign could've been so so much better with the greatest battles ever fought. No soviets like really? It's trying to have a good prologue/epilogue story but it's just mid. Not goosebumps level story like BF1. 

Multiplayer is mid aswell. Apart from lobbies full of cheaters it is not as satisfying as previous games. Plus respawn rate of vehicles is horrible. 

This game could've been a mastery even peaking over BF1 with all of the possible WW2 content. It just did not happen as this game marks a turning point with BF titles just going to shit. Buy it in sale for a few €."
every lobby has someone shooting you from 2km away behind 3 walls with zero vision.
"Electronic Arts require steam players to activate their game through EA app since 2023. Before that, we played their games through Origin platform. But after they changed their game launcher, Chinese players cannot log in their account and launch their EA games through EA app due to area limitations. Chinese steam players have to use VPN to change their location so that they can create or log in their EA account. I don't have that kind of tech. Besides, it is too annoying for steam players to spend so much effort on launching EA games. Right now, I cannot normally launch my EA games, so I want to refund this game. Because we pay the money but we cannot play the EA games. This is totally a defraud. I send the above info to steam stuff, but they simply refused my request and closed my case. They answered me in the old sentences: Your have played this game more than 2 hours. Nothing else. 
Steam stuff don't care about your game experience;
Steam stuff don't care whether you can normally run this game through EA app or other third- 
party launcher;
Steam stuff don't care whether you will be cheated by the game developer after you paid your money and several months later the game dev added new launcher yet you cannot normally log in or sign op your account and start your game;
Steam Stuff Only Care About The Money They Take From You."
"I'm a bit of a warbuff, I enjoy at least some historical accuracy. I uninstalled and refunded in the first minute of my first match. I was killed while running through smoke, turns out someone was on a rooftop with an M1 Garand that was equipped with a silencer and of all things... a THERMAL SCOPE..."

"I bought the game expecting to see historical events that were true to reality. Instead, I didn't find a single mention of the Soviet Union, nor the option to play as the Soviet Union in a World War II game. For me, this is an unacceptable experience. Absolute garbage, continue to make just arcade games, never touch world history again."
this game is not good (dogshid)
Holy cheaters batman
"2024 and the game still has connection issues, crashes and some cheaters"
"I completely think this game is 0% accurate, it seems so sad that the german side never wins ;("
"Very bad single player missions.
100% boring.
Did I buy battlefield or Solo Stealth Man Game.
Where is my team!!!!
Where is the battlefield?
Why am I sneaking around as a solo SBS soldier??"
a lot of bug
unplayable i play for 15 minutes the game freezes then crashes
bf1 was better
.
issues with fucking ea launcher. Game unplayable due this shit
"Reached level 20 on Medic yesterday and didn't receive the Medic Mastery challenge so I made a case and I'm stuck on the waiting on player, but when I try to resume my case, It redirects me into a support page to try and fix it myself, but it doesn't work, and it also doesn't resume the case when I click it.

The game is fun though."
"TOO MANY CHINNESE CHITER IN THIS FUCKING GAME,"
Spoilt by people using aimbots and other cheats.
"You think on the 5th iteration of something they would figure out how to make bipods, spawn locations, banning hackers, etc work correctly.

Do not buy, i feel ripped off and i payed $3.50"
EA anti cheat - Making sure people who have zero mods installed are booted out of the game
"Ive played and loved Battlefield vietnam, BF2, BF3, BF4, BF1.

But this version is just bad, 3 hours and im done, cant play this game."
Война для девочек
What a shit effort. Not worth your time.
"This is just my opinion: 

(Maps Design) BF's quality was decreasing from here. Some or (maybe) half of maps are sucks. The designer map team don't know how about to make proper maps for BFV franchise, {honorable mention for the two worst maps; Panzerstorm and Hamada, literally sniper campsite & tanker farming}. Many sucks maps in BFV has some similar problems just like too much open areas, lack of strategical contour/assets (buildings, ruins, etc), many of maps having some good point but lack of map authenticity, etc.

(Weaponry) Gunplay is good but weaponry specialization was ruined the BF's weaponry authenticity. Literally, you can modify some of important weapon stats just by specialization. It just not feels like BF1 or BF4 and, any previously BF series. Gunfire is not really good for make any significant difference, because when you are firing some certain weapons for comparison, just like A3 and Type 100. If you are firing them, you just can feels slightly different.

(Movement) The player movement is feels so light, even its bit similar or lighter than BF4 player movement. Ain't no way if you can run with Heavy Machine guns as fast as you run with SMGs or pistols. So, the weapon weight and feels of equipping certain weapon isn't feels like BF1.

(Voice Actor) If I compare BF1 VA and BFV VA, BF1 VA is so impactful, great determined, and tremendously deep into the character. But i don't know how to describe BFV VA, they are just sucks, lack of soul into the character, annoying and their voice just feels woke plus cringe in many times!

(Faction) Let the Germany or France forces joined the Pacific War? Come on dudes. It doesn't make any sense!

(Costumes) There are some cool skins/costumes. But there are some unnecessary or ridiculous skins/costumes
Many of them are just okay or mid. Nuff said.

(Music) they just okay.

(Sound effects) Some of BFV sounds are better than BF1. Absolutely explosive in certain distance and planes machine sound. But if we take a long distance from battlefield, you just hear almost nothing! This is the lack of echo sound at outdoor area, especially if there's crowded battlefield that full of machine gun, explosive, bomb drop, etc in sound effect. Yeah, you will hear almost nothing, or slightly some sound effects.

(Graphic) The graphic is so aesthetic but its too colorful. If BFV can make graphic for realistic atmosphere in world war aspect, dusty and gritty just like BF1, I would gladly accept that.

(New Features - after BF1) Medic and Ammo Container crates in any conquered flag is so good for me, as I thought its great too for ammo pouch dropped from died enemy. As a squad leader, availability for calling some air supports (area smoke screen, ammo/weaponry drop pile, airstrikes, certain unique tank, etc) is so really great game changer for gameplay dynamics and balancing for any team side perspective. A health pouch for any class is okay. Only the worst feature was the lack of health regen and limited are so freaking irritating for any unpredictable circumstance in gameplay."
this game is constantly crashing i'm done with this shit
"Un- ranked game mode only, matches are always one-sided."
i think ill stick to bf1...
"The balancing in this game is among the worst to ever exist. If that wasn't bad enough, it is a paradise for hackers. I have seen hackers talking in chat about the best place to buy hacks. Dying franchise for a good reason"
"I got this game on sale for $3.50 and feel I wasted my money. $3.50 worth is apparently all the ammo you get for the campaign, too. ""Allied forces went to war with no bullets,"" said no one ever. Yeah, I'm sure we saved the planet with empty rifles and all the soldiers had to constantly pick up enemy weapons, EA. Good thinking.

Edit: It gets worse the more I play. Invisible walls in front of machine gunners and light-tower enemies. Forcing you to waste more of the limited ammo you already have to scavenge for. They can hit you, but you can't hit them even with perfect line of sight and nothing in the way. Perfect shot after perfect shot after perfect shot - to the head, to the throat, to the heart. Why is there an invisible wall? WHY?! No, really, answer the question. Tell us why you would do this. I know BF isn't known for it's single player campaigns, but my god this is about the worst single player experience I've ever had. What a terrible game. I've never seen a less smooth way of going down ladders in my life. Going up is fine, going down you usually just fall. Why are the first few cut scenes so choppy? Did they even test any of this, or just throw it together and release it? It's like a joke was played on fans. The icing on the cake is when you get fed up with this crap and want to exit the game, it takes about 15 minutes to do so. 3/10. Great job guys. Screenshots don't even work most of the time."
shit
"It takes all the favorite classic elements of a Battlefield game and throws it all in the trash. Different classes? Yeah but why bother, everyone has med kits now and can revive anyone. You can pick up ammo of dead soldiers and from random ammo crates. Spray patterns for all weapons are completely random so you can never master a weapon or use it outside of it's specifically intended role. I can't blow up wooden walls with a rocket launcher but apparently my pistol can shoot through the wooden door right next to it. There is now an animation for reviving fallen teammates making it more risky and less rewarding as you're granted less points.

The UI menus are a mess and unpleasant to wade through especially since you now have to continue through multiple screens to play the game. Pass on this game and just get BF4 for BF1. Those games are far better and still have an active playerbase."

hackers
"full bugs, full cheaters, no fun, this game is just a big garbage"
"should just get 2042 imo, you can run with anti tank mines on a stick at meatbags but the game's pretty glitchy, wouldn't recommend over many other battlefield games"
Clunky
nothing but broken programming and cheaters.
community moderators can eat my shorts
Just play Battlefield 1
trash EA even $3.49 is a waste on this one
"The core of the game itself is fun. This is coming from someone whose favorite BF game was Bad Company 2. It has some of the soul of that game in it, with even larger scale mayhem. It's worth it if you get it on sale for 4 bucks.

However, I DO NOT suggest buying this for full price. This game came out 6 years ago and it is still littered with bugs. The EA launcher is the primary issue, and it's utter crap. Half the time it will ""hang"" in the background, preventing the game from even launching. To fix this, you need to open task manager (ctrl-alt-del) and end every EA background process, then re-launch from steam.

Rarely when you spawn in at the start of a round, you'll be completely stuck in place, and cannot do anything. The only fix I've found for this is ALT-f4'ing and restarting the game.

Vehicle-mounted machine guns will sometimes glitch out and load a low-res LOD version for the ironsights, removing your crosshair and rapidly flickering the UI.

On some maps there are wall glitches, where I've witnessed people clipping into the geometry and shooting in from outside the map.

*EDIT* EA does not moderate this game whatsoever. Hackers are free to ruin the game without punishment. They can join your match, and force redeploy (kill) all players in the lobby repeatedly until everyone leaves."
"You have lost connection to the EA servers)))

Edit: if you are having the same problem, the possible fix might be reinstalling Punkbuster anti cheat from its official website, then reinstalling the game via EA App interface.
Game is ok, still a negative review because this kind of problem should not exist."
"Another EA game, Another hacker filled games. EA doesnt care about hackers. All they care are the money hackers pay them to get 60/0 games without any skill"
"I fucking like playing this piece of shit game, but EA doesn't let me play, you fucking EA, why!! what's wrong with you!!! because your mom and dad love me? so you don't let me play eat shit you asshole!!!!"
no
Hackerfield V
Absolutely garbage game but for 3$ its got just enough fun to be had
Wasn't even worth the $3.49 I spent on the summer sale. How tf do you get your CUTSCENES to lag?
The most boring one in all of the games plus wont even launch correctly half of the time because of ea launcher yet I still play it because somehow its the one with the most players
"The number of cheater is insane, its is fun game thou, what a waste of good game"
Complete garbage
"I never have issues with steam games, but this game runs through the EA App and upon launching the ea runs for a bit then close making the game unplayable for me. It worked for a bit and is now doing it again. Just googling the issue I find players having this same issue for years with the EA app and still no fix. Buyer beware."
well i dislike that i cant play it on my steam deck
"Holy hell this game sucks! Campaign is so glitchy that if you die in certain areas it just skips part of the level. So repetitive, unclear how you are supposed to approach levels, tries to be open world but the levels are so linear it defeats the purpose. EA launcher is a mess and also changed settings on my GPU which has now made my screen start to flicker."
"Advertised as back to the roots experience. Well that is a lie. You level your guns enhancing them beyond what beginners get. Therefore it is always unbalanced and you gonna suffer as a beginner. Not (just) because you are new but because you are outteched. That is the reason for the ""negative"" review.
Cheating is not punished directly to save your system performance. You can report though.

Other than that it is the classic BF experience. Squadsystem is a huge plus. Sound is great. Visuals are nice. There is a single player campaign and a SquadPvE too."
"Can't really say much more other than... this feels like a soulless game, the campaign is terrible, short of value and any good gameplay mechanics, the first mission you play you will literally be able to use a vehicle that makes you invincible and also kills enemies by simply TOUCHING them, no need for speed at all and the physics on enemies immediately gave away what kind of game i was going to play as they were just laughably bad when they would die.

Movement and Gunplay are subpar and objectively some of the worst in the entire franchise, the slide is janky and causes your camera and viewmodel to shake left and right when you attempt to aim down the sights, they decided to stop your ability to shoot while vaulting over obstacles but the worst part is, how the gunplay now has random recoil, instead of recoil patterns like BF4 did, the recoil is also affected by your field of view with lower FOV being much much worse than high FOV, some guns and sights aren't even properly centered, the fact that your aimpoint isn't even on the center of the screen but instead is tied to your guns recoil makes this flawed gameplay element feel even worse, overall this game isn't deserving of more than a 4/10 as the multiplayer maps are just as bad as the ones present in 2042, glad i waited for this to be dirt cheap but unfortunately overall it just doesn't feel like a battlefield game, merely a cash grab really."
EA trash
I got this game for $4 on special and still feel ripped off. BF has turned into a COD impersonating game the devs should return to play a few games on BF1942 and Vietnam to remember what it is all about some of the functions in the game were cool like Bayonet charge and towing artillery etc but the maps were underwhelming and the gameplay resembles more of a COD feel then a Battlefield feel the old Battlefields and BF3 were huge and the war was amazing.
Decent game but you need the fucking EA launcher to even play this game even though you bought it on steam which is just BS.
shitty game i hope dis game sends us into a world war
"Worst Battlefield I have played. Almost the worst game I have ever played.  No map. No direction. Keep telling me to return to area when I have no idea where I'm going or where I'm suppose to go. This will be the first Battlefield that I will not finish. I might come back and continue when I have all the time in the world and have absolutely nothing else better to do.
Invisible wall; enemy can shoot at you, but you cannot shoot back. Smokes (not flash bang) in your area; you cannot anything around you. All you see is black smokes. But all of the enemies can see you clearly and shoot at you."
"hackerfield
a simple kick to vote would have solved everything but nah"
CHEATERS
"rubbish game, there's lot of cheaters and those chinese soyboy players keep kicking me from the game for no absolute reason, even though i somewhat owned in score match, i regret i bought this game, even the price was laughable. play BF1 instead of this."
"I could ignore alll the bugs and glitches but what I cant ignore is the fact that there are constantly problems with connecting to multiplayer games. It is the game not my system. everything else works. 
I just get dumped into main menu instead of loading into a MP game. SP works just fine ( well except some of the game breaking bugs which come up some times...."
game sucks i never played it 👍
"Good game, but find yourself a dedicated server the kill time is crazy, guy can get shot by a sniper round in the chest run off heal and repeat. found a hardcore server WAY WAY WAY more fun."
Gimmeh more tank gameplay >:(
"A meh addition to the Battlefield franchise with a campaign to be ignored and a cheater problem. Abysmal UI and general gameplay. Ear-no-no-sexy loud with no ability to change the volume for several minutes. Unskippable and annoyingly loud intro. All-in-all I can only assume development was a nightmare if this is what we got.

4/10.

Update 8/1: Steam has refused my refund request 4 times. The Multiplayer does NOT work and is FILLED with cheaters, the Campaign is BAD, the Writing is WORSE, and the Gameplay is a 6/10 at its best. This game is a disgrace to what I remember from Battlefield 3.

 ...and, because it takes more than 2 hours to test, meaning Steam has lost the monetary incentive to listen to you, there doesn't seem to be a chance at a refund for a broken and abandoned $4 scam. You will not receive the experience/gameplay described, after paying money for it. You're better off buying a fucking case and key in CS2... but do it in LoL or Valo, not here!"
nagyon nem jó
"Gotta say, after putting a few hours into this game, I don't recommend for even battlefield vets.

My review is heavily weighted towards older battlefield and old DICE games, on top of the ridiculous initial marketing for this game.

I have played Battlefield 1942, Vietnam, Battlefield 2, 2142, 1943, Bad Company 1 and 2, Battlefield 3 and 4, and finally but not the least Battlefield 1

The movement of this game, is incredibly smooth, [b]Too Smoth[/b]. That is a bad thing, because these games always had the core movement of the player character in mind while scaling maps and balance. It actually feels like i'm playing more modern call of duty with how fast people move in this one, it does not fit.

The Character customization is a complete mess and whoever was in charge of the clothing department, good work but also wow how did you screw up so hard by letting us make monstrosities, half of the time without the spotting system i couldn't tell if the guys i'm shooting at were friendly or enemies, it's [b]that bad[/b]

Gun balance was left in a state of it favoring heavily towards full automatic and broken weapons at close quarters, instead of punishing that kind of gameplay by letting other players mow them down with high powered rifle fire or machine guns, they cater more to.. what appears to be the Call of Duty Crowd which is really awful to think about.

Vehicles were nice but there could've been way more, and more than half of them were Frankenmachines. They missed out a lot of more iconic planes and tanks as well which sucks.

There are two good things about this games single player, yes that one.

The Prologue was actually okay, however with the amount of historical inaccuracies and ways to break immersion by not being authentic enough it actually loses more points than gain any. I wished the pilot segment was fully fleshed out as a campaign in it self, not sure why they decided to not include that, especially since BF1 with its war stories had one when launched.

[i]Oh and The Last Tiger was the only good one just as a note.[/i]

With how disrespectful this game was to WW2 veterans and those who made the ultimate sacrifice in fighting evil, this game sure likes to erase those same heroes and make up brand new ones and completely fabricate history for sake of modern political activism to younger more gullible generations. Also for a game about us shooting Nazis, there are sure lack of them at all to shoot at, weird.

Overall, even on a sale of $3.49. This game is just simply not worth your time if you prefer older battlefield games, its novelty wears off fast and it's just not a fun game. They did some right in terms of gameplay but most of it is bad, and context wise.... This ones a write-off.

Oh and there are a lot of cheaters in this too so, be warned you're probably going to be fighting a bunch of them if you're going to touch Multiplayer."
"The game is amazing! Astonish graphic and everything but it's literally impossible to play. FULL of cheater, the movement of the soldiers is unnatural people is moving at 200 km/h and slide like if was running a snowboard so it;s impossible to target people. Instead the cheaters target you from the other side of the map in 1 sec and kill you whit a single head shot. It's only frustrating! What a SHAME"
The launcher never works. Get rid of it
"Wokefield 5, I can't believe 101th Airborne has femboys and women... You don't contribute to certain people's rights by pooping into games with ""historical"" claims. Just call it fiction if you gonna add imaginery things bruh"
Just get 2042 its better
not worth full price
"classes unbalanced recoil is dumb on some weapons. 

You will come to hate recon/sniper being able to just insta click your head in under the latency time.

meh if its like $3."
"No audio bug for windows 10, I have to reinstall this game to fix it"
wont launch after the new anticheat update
"got this for less than $5, still has the same balancing issues from 4 years ago and ea will never ever touch this game"
New kernel-level anti-cheat system has made it impossible to play on Linux. Neither Wine nor virtual machines are working.
So many bugs
"A game that disconnects you from EA's server every 5 minutes with no error code. Bravo EA, thank you for the useless launcher and even more useless broken online in your game."
"This is like a poor man's bf1. Boring as hell, controls are clunky, wall vaulting is super awkward, and the hacking infestation is ridiculous."
battle field 1 100 times better. maps here are way too small its total call of duty..
"Fun game, but the EA launcher should be tried for crimes against humanity and put away. Why do we need a second launcher when we buy a game from Steam? Does anybody at EA care about making a good product that people will want to play?"
"For a corporate game, it's okay. The maps are pretty, and the loading intro is annoying (I was confused why I was forced into the single player intro).  The game is close to the quality of the original Battlefield, but definitely not as fun. I feel at times it's trying to make itself like all other multiplayer fps' with silly stats, points, and character customization. I wish we had the quality like Bad Company 2.

I blame influences from Call of Duty and their work on Star Wars Battlefront for how the game is laid out. The messages that cover half the screen are hardly relevant; I don't want to see announcements of when the first teammate is killed. This game is a sniper's nightmare, where everyone is aware of where shooters are before, and especially after, getting killed.

It's pretty looking though."
Hackers everywhere
"Crap Game made by greedy devs. Hackers everywhere. DICE can go suck a fat one. UPDATE: still crap, fuck the devs on their shit game. insta killed every time I load in. no way around it. just insta killed every time"
"The amount of cheaters running so rampant and the developer doing nothing about it even after reporting seems to show a general lack of care as they work towards the next instalment of another hacker infested game.

Hackerfield 5 - Where banning hackers is a ""LEGACY"" feature"
Dont buy this
Frequent crashing and disconnects
Was a GREAT game but it's dead now
"Games been abandoned, overrun with cheaters but was fun otherwise. The same cheaters have been doing the same thing for months and I'm talking dozens of grenades thrown at you, respawning everyone on the map, speed hacks, noclipping etc so its not just your casual aimbot but literal round ending cheats."
As far as I can tell we're still playing against the same blatant cheats people have been using since BF3. There are zero server enforcement tools and servers are named with long series of numbers so you can't even avoid the bad ones (they're all bad though so don't even try). Nobody should be allowed to release a PC shooter until they've fixed anti-cheat
lost connection to server constantly
"Thought I'd try this, as the last one I played was Battlefield 3 and this was on offer. Got a refund after just two hours of game time, and all of all that was just trying to get the control settings right.

Shouldn't be having to do that. You should just be able to jump into a game and enjoy it.

Not admin the fudge out of it!"

"I don't like leaving negative reviews, but I just couldn't help myself this time.
(FYI, this is strictly a single-player review.)

When I buy a war game, especially one called ""Battlefield"", my intention is to fight in battles. 
75% of the campaign missions I played were stealth or infiltration missions where you, all by your lonesome, *have to avoid combat* unless you want to be outmatched and overwhelmed by a horde of enemies.  I don't mind the occasional stealth mission, but one or two throughout are more than enough for me!  The following is a glimpse of my experience...

Story 1:
Mission 1: Stealth - ""Okay, that's fine, let's get it out of the way early.""
Mission 2: Stealth – (Pinky already hurts from mashing the crouch) ""F- this, I'll do it later...""

Story 2:
Mission 1: Stealth - ""SIGH!!"" Alright, fine...  Let's get this over with!
Mission 2: Stealth - ""Oh, ffs...""  (Proceeds to ignore all stealth and shoot my way through)
Mission 3: Stealth - ""OH FFS!!""  (Starts with neat skiing section that's over way too soon, get bored and quit)

Story 3: (Is Prefaced: HIGH INTENSITY!)  ""LET'S. ****ING. GO!""
Mission 1: Awesome battle! Genuinely fun!  More of this, please!!  Loved it!
Mission 2: Guess whaaaaat...  You're separated from your squad for a STEALTH MISSION!!! WEEE!!! (Quits)

Story 4:
Mission 1: WW2 Tank Battle?  ""Dope!""  But you're the Germans! ""Less dope, but whatever, let's play."" 
Shoot stuff for 5 minutes... kind of fun.  Just getting into it. Game crashes.  Roll eyes.  Comes here to write review.

If you like stealth missions, then check this game out.  If you're looking for cool battles, you might want to look elsewhere.

Also, when the player is in a story section, please just make it a cinematic!  I was Usain Bolt 2 seconds ago, but now that someone important is yelling exposition at me, I'm restricted to going half the speed of a Grandmother with arthritis?  It might seem silly, but it's insanely frustrating being ""in control"" of your character but suddenly having all of your mobility drained just because it's story time.  If it's a cinematic then I'm not forced to actively try pushing through the irritating narrative molasses you put in our way.  I'd rather sit back and enjoy whatever story you're trying to tell rather than get angry that I'm stuck running in slow motion.  That is literally a thing that people have nightmares about lol."
Unsure if it's the younger me enjoying battlefield but I personally feel like this game does not hit as hard as battlefield 1 did. It's still good but cheaters have utterly ruined the game.
Dogshit game servers are busted
"They nailed that campaign, but multiplayer sucks when you have to use full magazine on dude that kills you with 2 bullets."
"EMpty, boring , not immersive, bad game play logic, horrible intro but diverse."
Runs it was launched off of EA.
mid as shit
I have a great internet conection and this shitty game cant even connect to the servers not to mention playing with fellas
"This game is a big disappointment. BF1 is way better then this. gameplay, atmosphere, graphics are terrible compared to BF1. Its like a battleroyale game. Way too colorful and maps are too bland. Also, its insanely inaccurate. This is a ww2 game not a modern war game. Playermodels are so stupid. There was no black women as snipers in the us army. Soldiers did not have punk hair. Also, Where are the soviets? Where is the Operation Overlord? Battle of Stalingad? these were the most important events in the ww2. And EA decided to not add them. Very little content. Also you cant get serious while playing. In BF1, it felt like real war. Screams, bombs exploding everwhere, teammates getting destroyed by artillery in front of you etc. This games purpose was to replace BF1. But the opposite happened. Its not that terrible, playable, but did not impress me. 4/10."
Im actually amazed at just how bad BF5 is
"WORST FUCKING GAME.
EA NEVER MAKING A GOOD GAMES"

Here I will leave this beautiful Capybara, whoever passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up (I need Steam Points)."
Game is no longer playable on my system - some fault between steam and the EA app prevent the game from launching and EA has been unwilling to fix the problem.
"EA forced the game to have kernel anti-cheat (EAC), making it impossible to play on Linux."
Not worth the $$ for a few hours of solo play. Probably ok if you want to online FPS.
dont even bother trying the campaign on hardcore....
"playable, but mid tbh overall"
Crashes constantly and the EA app is terrible
"Game is mostly dead it seems. There are very few servers during the week and absolutely no hardcore servers during the week. I've been told its a bit better on the weekend, but the game is not worth it at normal price as it seems it was barely worth the 4 I paid during summer sale. Personally i only play hardcore and got lucky enough to find a single server the day i got on and it was very fun, but the past 2 or 3 days I've been disappointed with the lack of servers."
"""ea anticheat has detected an unacceptable configuration please ensure no cheat-related or tampering software is active and restart the game 115"" unplayable shi7. Im so happy i gave only 3$ for this shi7"
"This is the first Battlefield i ever played and it will probably be the last. 
Although the looks are really good and even the dialogue of enemy soldiers is funny at times.
I have been playing a lot of different shooters but never ever did the shooting feel so off like in this game.
For example sniping a standing target while standing still myself the bullets just sail right through the enemy for whatever reason. Even normal rifles just seem to miss shots that are 100% on the enemy, that just killed the fun for me completely. 
I must say i would be really mad if i had payed more than a few € for this."
honestly not even worth 3 bucks!
"The gameplay is alright and all but just launching this piece of EA shit is way too much work. I had to dig my way through the files to manually install the anti cheat and the fact that launching this game has to go through EA's own launcher (which is a huge shit show within itself). It isn't worth the trouble, just play bf1."
Doesn't feel like working not launching waste of money don't buy it or any battlefield game on PC . Lets all Show EA we mean business no more PC gamer money .
ping is too high
Refunded... Doesn't work on Linux anymore due to Anti Cheat.
The game crashes to desktop and leaves no hints in the event viewer in nearly every game I play.
cant get any matches :(
"yeah, no."
fuck ea
no pacific campaign? sad
"the chynese shouldnt be in this game, please ban this game in chyna"
"sadly not anymore, is a great game but in aus for me its unplayable to much lag sad as i enjoyed it"
fuckkkkkkkk
terrible game dont buy it sucks it is not fun bc it gets to laggy
Shitty game
I spent money on this game to play on steam deck when I first got it in 2023. Then EA decided I'm not allowed to play it anymore with there bad anti cheat. Thank EA for stealing my money
"I tried, I realy did try to enjoy this and I did for a brief moment in time... I feel like 50+ hours is more than a decent attempt and fair chance.  EA does not give one tiny flying ants worth of care with regards to stopping the cheaters.  They care about getting your dollars, taking those dollars, keeping those dollars, and then trying to get more from you by letting the game go to rotten steaming dung by not maintaining it and then when you're sick of it they'll sell you the solution boxed up as the something new, but the truth is, it's the same old thing with a little more spit and polish and you know what, all it will take to get that new game that maybe doesn't have a bunch of hacks on it is another pile of your hard earned money.  I'm so thankful I only gave them about 3 dollars, but I'm sad I spent so much time trying to like the game and convince myself that maybe it was skill issue and not cheats/hacks... but no, I've been playing games long enough to know the difference between someone schooling me with skill or using wallhacks/aimbots/etc... this game and all EA pvp games are riddled with horrible hacks and they won't do anything to resolve the issue because they don't think it hurts the bottom line regarding finances.

Edit:  ""you've played 26 hours more since review, would you like to revise your review?"" --- no Steam, I would not like to revise my review.  I have had some of the most frustrating rounds of gaming ever due to the unhindered cheats/hacks plaguing this game.  I am still playing only out of lack of decent competition on the grand-scale-war games... I don't want to pitch out for the most recent call of duty because it's simply not worth their asking price, so SADLY, this is the populated game I've found to scratch my itch for this game style.  I'm not going to grade it on a bell curve, just because the other games of this style are equally as bad or worse or simply not populated on the servers doesn't mean this game is good... it just means it's not the worst."
"fuck EA, wouldnt be playing it if the recent one was good"
"Feels cheap. No joke, this game looks like a cheap copy of BF1. The multiplayer gameplay feels like a college end-of-semester project with all the assignments combined into one. I do not recommend this game. Just play BF1 instead."
"From the very start, this game is plagued with graphical issues like texture pop-ins and stuttering objects.
The narrative is insanely preachy and takes itself so seriously in a grandstanding manor that you find yourself hating it.
Artistic/aesthetic design choices that force you out of the idea that you're in a world war 2 setting.
Battlefield as a franchise keeps getting more fast-paced, resembling a wild movement shooter, whereas in the GOAT that was Bad Company 2, movement was limited and the game felt more grounded in reality.

Thank god I bought this at $4 because I could not imagine paying $60+ for this"
Nah crashes loads
"Hacker in every single game, almost 0 before super deluxe ultimate edition anti cheat technology implemented."
NOT FUN
Should have gone all-out and added more content to this game instead of the heap of garbage that is 2042
POS ANTI CHEAT
Not even worth the $3.49 with how many hackers are in this game.
Battlefield 5 is nothing like  Battlefield  1
"This game is ass now days i used to run mods for rehauls and when i got the news EA was deleting files in Battlefield V i felt dissapointed and this game is finished and no longer recieving updates like WTF and also the game is a full of Cheaters ruining the game and you intended this game to be ""Historicly accurate"" you only scratched the Surface you got not much right but some but also this game is political is what ruins the game i hate the cosmetic system and the pre order cosmetics system you could of done so much more with this game BUT NO! you had to rush the game and this is what we got wow i am highly dissapointed for the history and stuff this game had to go through but its still somewhat a good game in a way i only like the campaign levels i would only buy this on a sale."
Absolutely bad.
Ah hell no. Go back to BF1 or older games.
"i bought this game, in hoping to play. but hell, i can't even open it. it's the EA launcher that won't let me and told me i do not own the game. i have tried various effort to fix. wasted 3 days. 

it's just the EA launcher is so trash"
i got this game cause it was £3 and honestly not worth £3 there was times in the game where i couldn't change my weapon and i couldn't shoot during battle so i couldn't complete any missions it happened in every mission i played if your looking for a good shooter game this isn't the game for u
"total crap

its full, really full of hackers => unplayable

the gaming itself is just ""empty"". there is nothing, only graphics.
there is also lag. 
many rifles are that weak.
when you shot someone from behind in his back and you get a lmg, or a asaultrifle, then he still can kill you because the spread stops you form making damage soon and he can turn and shot you with one of the few accurate guns."
There are times I cannot swap guns after a cinematic
-
"Had a really great time for the first 20 hours playing online, then you realize there's at least one hacker in every single official server. The bad news is, they won't fix it, just like with Battlefield 1."
EA sloppp
"Not that I'm expecting a lot from a 6 year old game by the company that disrespected 2042 so badly, but there is, without fail, at least 1 person cheating in every single match I've played. Usually more. Yikes"
"Hackers will find you, no matter where you try to camp or hide, gain a strategic advantage, this game isnt cared for, so you shouldnt care for it either. Fuck you EA. The OG BF community hates your ass."
TOO MANY CHEATERS
How is it allowed that EA launcher keeps running in the background even after you close the game. Steam is selling malware attached to its games now?
"Use to work on Linux, no longer. Why? Some anti-cheat EA blames on an operating system. Please spare me."
Honestly not a great game. get battlebit or hell let loose instead :/
they broke it for steam deck
It’s too infested with cheaters not worth it at all
CAN I LAUNCH MY FUCKING GAME????? WHAT THE HELL IS UP WITH THE LAUNCHER??
too many hackers
"Played few times from different gamepasses now could not retun when i bought from sale, now its just full waiting to get shot thru 3 bushes and never lifted up..."
"$3.49 and the game constantly crashes on startup...,

 the furthest i was able to get to was the brightness screen that showed a black box at 100% brightness, then crashed the final time i was willing to put up with.  

DUMPSTER FIRE"
Game is $3.49. Literal pocket change. Still wont buy it.
not good
doesnt work
"Wouldn't even launch, tried a dozen fixes nothing."
In terms of historical accuracy this game is so far removed from reality that it's best described as a work of fiction
worst game iv ever played.
"This game is the worst. Well all ea games mostly suck, horribly. 

At first glance I saw this game and thought to myself: ""This is gonna be so cool! A good looking cinematic game with a decent fps shooter. And it has a multiplayer!?"" 
That was the wretched fool I was. Believing that, an ea game, would be good. Honorable garbage. Distinctly, one of the worst game's I've ever laid my cursor on. Unfortunate. 
To anyone reading. Don't waste your time, money, effort, and, soul into an ea game.
It's the same hot steaming pile of garbage every time. Like activision, truly, the worst. 
Let's break it down as to why ea sucks horse genitals. 
Reason One: Ea refuses to ever actually make a good fucking anti cheat, capable of doing it's damn job. Like activison, too. Great job, following in the footsteps of failure, ea :0
Reason Two: As reference to Reason One; Hackers. Hackers are in every Multiplayer game you join. Another ea L.
Reason Three: SO MUCH LAG THAT IT IS UNBEARABLE. Holy. Hot. Steaming. HELL. There is so much lag for a high end PC. Why? Why you might ask? Because. EA CAN'T MAKE A FUCKING GAME USABLE. 
Recurring Thoughts Here.
Why did I waste my money on an ea game, thinking that it would be good :( 
How come my decent PC can't run this game... ON THE LOWEST. SETTINGS. 
How come I can max out Minecraft, Java Edition, on full settings, and get around quite literally: thousands of more FPS.
""I updated my drivers, I should be able to run this game wonderfully on a nice RTX 3060!"" HELL FUCKING NO. 
Moral of this goofy ass story. Don't waste your time with ea, thinking that, oh hey, I'll have a good time. Because No. No you fucking won't. Ever.

Unfortunate Regards~ The Dumbass Who Bought An EA Game.
Have a good day."
The game crashes on startup banner. Tried every fixes available on internet nothing helped.
Nothing says WWII like electronic sights and suppressors. This is just a game set in modern times with WWII skins.
hackers are constantly DICK riding
"Nobody plays, dead servers, and hacker issue."
"You are literally given every weapon in the game off the start, you cant 'opt' out of that. Its the only version of the game you can buy on Steam.

Be aware of that when you buy, there is literally 0 progression for you to do."
"servers are non existent, dont bother getting it"
This game is so bad like it tried to be as fun like battlefield 1 but they really did try just go and play battlefield
"same as another battlefield game, no longer getting new update from the dev, VERY BORING :("
"It's fine for £3.50 on sale, but I wish I could skip the Nazi campaign, for obvious reasons.

Hmm. The game quit out twice in two attempts to get back into the campaign. By the way: why is the campaign practically hidden on a screen full of multiplayer modes?

I may as well get my money back. Sorry EA, I don't know what I was thinking."
"Purchased during steam sale for less than a cup of coffee, wish I would have gotten coffee."
"trash game,The server can't connect at all,Bastard EA"
maps are good but the weapons are shit
"this SUCKS!! I cant even play it with out having to fix the game files my self and even then it wont start up, Iv uninstalled this twice now and it still wont start the right way, a game of this size  made by EA it should have no issue starting up"
"I really tried to like this game, but it really isn't fun for a new player. 
The guns don't feel unique, every class has like 10/20 guns only for themselves to choose from, but they feel almost identical and have extreme recoil. 
There are 2 types of maps, 1. the urban ones, which are OK, but boring to play on. 2. And the plain ones, such as half of the Pacific maps. The plain maps are full of snipers, which makes it extremely hard to advance forward. You have no other choose to either pick sniper as well, or get in a tank or some other vehicle, which if you know how is really easy to counter.
The maps aren't beautiful and interesting as the ones in Battlefield 1. 
The Game is arcadey so don't expect realism, prepare for tanks reloading for 2 seconds driving in 70+kmph, even the heavy ones. 
Battlefield V could't exactly be called WWII game. It only has maps and modes on The Pacific, Western Europe and little bit of Northern Africa. There's no WWII without USSR. So many missed opportunities to add Eastern Europe battles, which we're the biggest in WWII. Imagine how great it would've been if there was Battle of Stalingrad? Battle of Kursk? Legendary battles for sure! But no, DICE decided that Solomon Islands we're more important, even Greece? Another Major Nation that is missing is Italy and China. These would've been incredible campaigns to be added. 
I could go on and on but it really isn't worth of my time explaining how much I didn't like that game.
+EA Launcher fcking sucks.
Battlefield 1 and Battlefront 2 are way better that this, buy them instead."
Trash game! Cant shoot anything.
"Client problem. Tried everything, even reinstalling the game or reinstalling the EA client, it still won't show the friend list in the game. You can't interact with the client, can't invite friends, and it's very lagging... This has been happening for some years and somehow EA still hasn't got it fixed."
"Ddim BF1, a hynny yw ddrwg. Mae'n ddiflas."
Absolutely riddled with aim-botters and wall-hackers.  Do not waste your valuable time or money on this trash.
fix anticheat
"Battlefield 1 is better than this with Operations; with this game, you will be lucky even to have fun if you get into a halfway decent map, but if you get into a lobby with some of the most brain-dead teammates you will ever see good luck some people will run right past you and not pick you up even when no one is around them for miles. Tanks are an abomination in this game. They will camp away from everything in the open so they don't get surprised by anyone, which hinders the game. Snipers in this game are awful unless you are good at head shooting like some people claim they are. If you are right on someone and shoot them in the upper chest/neck region, you will get the utmost 80 damage, which then you have to switch to your pistol; by the time you do that, you will be dead from an assault class. 

The worst of them all is the brightness/darkness of the game. You can't see anything in this game without straining your eyes.

All in all, buy BF1 and have a better time with recon, assault, support, or medic. With the amount of people on BF1, though, you will only get four maps, but those four maps are amazing to play."
"Cheating problem is insane if you don't play on community servers, no dedicated servers with plugins and auto moderation, development basically cut in the middle of fixing the game, feels nothing like battlefield. Overall a 6/10 game, but if you want a battlefield experience just skip it and buy 3/4/1."
"This game sucks major ass, can't even call people a nigger in text chat. Still came while playing 0/11 stars"
Doesn't work even with recommended computer specs.
wont launch
"EA send the FBI to me and i told them to GTFO or be killed.
You americans think you can rule the world through games now, well i have a message for you : FUCK YOUR RACE AND YOUR FASCISTS JEW ASSFUCKING INBRED ATTITUDE !
EA = MOSSAD !!!"
"EA sucks, just got a 49"" monitor and was stoked to play bfv on it. And now the game won't even freaking launch. I'm kind of new to pc so maybe there's a way to fix it, but the fact that you have to do all this b.s just to play the game really kills it for me. EA SUCKS!"
Where the fuck is the eastern front! All this WWII games with just axis vs allies should be 50% off by default since they are lacking AT LEAST half of the conflict.  That said tank battles can be entertaining.
"Not a good game, don't buy."
Enjoying the game but these hackers are just ruining it. EA improve your stupid ANTI-HACKING SYSTEM
maps barely had airplanes!!!! UGH
"I kinda like this game, there were already a lot of cheaters, they actually updated the game with a new anti cheat, which broke Linux support, but there are still a lot of cheater, numbers increasing :("
bf5's good but ea is so trash wtf
Steam Luncher has serious issues with lunching the game.
NO.I Don‘t like it.
go woke go broke
아니요
This game sucks
NOT REKOMENDED CHEATER IS EVERYWHERE
soo many cheater at asia server
"Dogshit multiplayer experience, unable to play with friends, custom squads, bad asf EA client taht constantly rendering pc/laptop not to boot the game"
idk how 30k people are playing this. Not even worth 4$ lmao
Don't buy this game if you have an AMD graphics card. You'll get an error to update the driver and even though you update the driver and do all kinds of other shit it still wont work. Fuck ea games.
"The game is broken 
Open the game
enter a lobby
get to the field
the game stops its self
goes for 6 times
uninstall the game 
go back to BF1"
"enter multiplayer
invisible cheater with 70 kills and 2 deaths
uninstall game
refund"
"This game is SIX years old and its STILL plagued by bugs. Finish a game? Nope, it'll DC as the match ends. Land that shot? Nope, servers are made from potatoes. Got the jump on an enemy? Nope, they have wall hack and auto aim.

I paid $4.50 for this and I'm still disappointed. Can we please remove EA from the ""AAA"" list."
垃圾ea，不建议入手任何ea游戏。新手小白刚买的游戏就被封，打折多少都不能买，纯纯浪费钱影响心情。CTM
Fu*k EA and Fu*k EA launcher
Not even worth it for the single player part of it
"CHEATER EVERYWHERE.... YEP THEY TYPE A PERSON WHO CAN'T AIM PROPERLY AND JUST SMASHING THAT MOUSE/CONSOLE


DON'T BOTHER TO SPEND OR BUY THIS SH!T EVEN IF ITS $0.01"
This game sucked hard. Bad software. Crap controls. Lop sided match making. Poor pop counts. Crappy crappy guns... it took to much of my life to install the software for this.
15 minute unskippable cutscene before you even get to the main menu
"This is simply not WW2. The wehrmacht nor the allied forces had 70% women employed on the frontlines. The game is fun, but the immersion is terrible. It feels like an alt history take on WW2."
"Servers full of hackers, and no way to play with bots besides story mode unlike older Battlefield games. Idk why they can't just let those of us that wish to play offline do so, clearly the bots exist.... Refunded, and it was only 3 dollars, not even worth that imo."
Cheaters paradise...
stuttering on all low settings with a threadripper and 3090ti
"Terrible server support. Garbage game design.
 I can barely post this ssit review. Avoid this  BS"
"Was told this game is great, and it turned out that hackers are everywhere"
dogshit
"the game itself is a masterpiece, a lot of great game  modes... but u play online so most games u play got a ton of cheaters using engineer class.. killing everyone with his LMG got no chance to even enjoy multiplayer modes... u will only drop dead most of the time.... i even repported 1 player and next day i see that fcker again... seems like anti cheat isnt  working at all"
"For 3.50 EUR (my regional price) it's worth it to boot up a few games and mess around.
But as a Battlefield game it's probably by far the worst one. The weapons feel terrible, they have no customisation or attachments. Everyone is using the same two weapons for each class.
The conquest maps are all horrible. It's either open fields or chokepoints only.
Tanks completely dominate every lobby. Think you can sneak up to it and kill it? Spawning as assault you have 2 Rockets, 2 C4 (dynamite) and you can choose an Anti-Tank bundle grenade. If you connect all 5 of those, you barely do 100 damage. And tanks have an instaheal button, so they have about 140 ehp.
So far in 20 hours I've seen about 5 hard cheaters (LMG headshotting rage hack type shit), god knows how many more non-blatant ones.
There is literally no progression, pick what you want and play. All weapons have the same dozen ""perks"".

But fuck it dude, for 3.50 EUR grab it, play a weekend with the boys and never come back."
Yo this game F***en sucks what the hell did they do to this battlefield I was just playing single player and I couldn't even f***en shoot back how does AI cheat HAHA fire whoever made this game. I want my 3 funky a** dollars back. HAHA just madness. They should have just made it battlefield like the originals not a second rate COD game.
傻逼EA，垃圾一般的UI，加好友都加不了，有时Launcher都开不了白屏脑瘫玩意就他妈的惦记你那逼垃圾EA LAUNCHER吗用steam不好？开启游戏的速度跟史一般，玩你家游戏真的是事事不顺利
The multiplayer simply does not work. I tried connecting to a bunch of different servers for an hour straight to no effect. The rest of my time playing was me going through the campaign. It's dogs*it. Go play Battlefield 4.
"fully of campers. tanks are harder to kill, like even a damn PUMA takes panzerfaust like its a cheese."
The single player version is good but very short. Majority of the game is multiplayer online and sucks.
"Redirects you to the EA app instantly, spammes you with error code E:10000, triples your ping for no reason, dosent show friends and dosent allow you to turn off vsync which the game got the fps underlocked."
"EA sucks, no more linux support. DON't BUY ANY EA GAMES."
single player was ass
"DO NOT BUY, DO NOT BUY

Anti-cheat just causes the game to crash consistently. I can no longer play this game as a result."
the game does not run and has to click several times from steam. broken i guess. but once you entered the game itself is okay. the only issue is the game require internet and even if you only want to play single player game. it still hard to even run the game from steam. no wonder they discount the prize till low as hell. cause the program is not stable on steam
"I already owned this on the ea launcher but it was on sale. playing it again makes me realize this is just a badly executed ripoff of battlefield and cod mechanics. Please don't buy it, just buy bf1"
the player base of this game is dead the only game mode ever available is Conquest and even then if you want to play on NA servers for a ok ping you will be out of luck
worst battlefield game ever made
"Its not worth 1$ . Go give that 3,50 to a charity you loser ."
"O Hell Naw. If u love being constantly fought by players WAAAAAAAAAY out of your league that play this fucking shit. Fuck EA with a damn cactus, how the hell they manage to make a worse battlefield every fucking year that fucking talent. Avoid this shit at all cost. Matter of fact, avoid this shit like a damn debt collector."
"cant play because ea app

fuck you, you worthless fucks"
"Game won't launch whatever you do. I ve tried to find a fix but did not find anything that worked for me. Do NOT buy . In fact, Steam should remove this game from the store."
"battlefield 1 does everything better

gunplay, story etc

very buggy as well, optimization is awful (i hv a rtx 4060)"
"piece of shit game, i bought it 3 days ago and last 2 days i am constantly getting disconnected from servers 
""lost connection to ea servers""

i paid for this shit and i cant even play for 5 minutes straight, i want my money back"
"Just like those fake gameplays at E3.
The beginning started so well and interesting, though.
It feels like 95% of the game is just scripted garbage, like an interactive movie or something.
Got it only for single player, as i don't care about multiplayer, so my review is strictly related to that, i have no idea how it is online so i cannot comnent.

I am glad i bought it before the sale ended, so i won't buy the newer ones either.
Disappointing 'experience', i guess i will go back to BF Bad Company and maybe 3 whenever i feel like playing Battlefield.

It also has some heavy freezing/stuttering in cutscenes, and guess what, all the nazi stuff is pretty much censored, which, i find ironic.

It's very short and mostly filled with just cutscenes, it feels limited and very scripted. 

And people complained about the asset flips on Steam being low effort lol"
the ea app is one of the worst things to ever be created
"Game is awful, players in game are worse."
garbage
cannot open the game!
"This is not going to be a bad review because of EA. this is a negative review because the game just sucks. This feels like a cheap copy of bf 1 -all the good stuff. 

pros:
- good revive system 
- really smooth gameplay
- you can see if you are tagged

cons:
- every gun is already unlocked for you so there is very little procession (the most fun part of Battlefield)
- tanks can turn 360 degrees in 1 sec
- small tanks have way too much armor
- gun meta
- way worse graphics than bf1
- animations in solo missions are really really bad 
- the first solo mission when you play for the first time is just a worse version of the bf1 mission
- very little immersion
- planes are less fun
- 50% off some maps are just vehicles
- healing yourself is weird 
- you can spawn on squad mates even if there is a enemy next to him 

These are things I immediately noticed within 1 hour, it is clearly a cash grab form the hype of bf1 
it feels like a shitty arcade version of bf1 so it is very surprising that it even has positive reviews. How is this made by the same studio as bf 3,4 and 1?"
"garbage, I have never been more infuriated by a game it's f##king dogsh#t"
"cant fucxing open the game, like wtf EA?!?!?!?!"
"Apparently EA discriminates against handicap gamers. I am a one-handed gamer, sort of. I only have a thumb on my left hand so keyboard and mouse games are not possible for me to play unless I use reSWAD to map keyboard and mouse functions to my controller. Which I do for several games that do not have any controller support. However, reSWAD is OFF, it is NOT running in the background yet Battlefield V refuses to start up stating it cannot run at the same time as reSWAD... IT IS NOT RUNNING! IT IS OFF! I bought this game to play the one player campaign but EA apparently hates gamers with legitimate handicaps. I should not have to uninstall a necessary program every time I want to play a one player game that I paid for the rights to play. 
I'd love to review this game but all I can say is shame on you EA."
"EA retroactively added their new anti-cheat to this title, making a once playable game [b]fundamentally broken on Linux systems, Steam Deck included.[/b] I really appreciate when purchased games become made unplayable on entire systems years after release.

If you have this on Windows, treat this review as cautiously recommended. It's a fantastic entry in the series imo but I've heard a lot of talk about the new anti-cheat being ineffective and problematic for Windows players too."
Unplayable due to  large amount of hackers
"the game is ok, but it is buggy and will rarely even open without going through some series of opening and closing apps and/or restarting the PC."
"Recon class: The snipers of the game supposed to provide long range support from cover.
Every optic for Recon class rifles has stupid amounts of glint so everyone sees you across the map, so cover at any range is pointless. 

Other classes are okayish, Hell Let Loose is ten times better. I do not recommend Battlefield 5"
crap
having come from bf3 i'm kinda shocked how little difference there is overall. Honestly just gonna go back and maybe get my $3.50 back.
"it's feels like you're playing a free to play version of call of duty in a bad engine. it's an alright game, but there's a lot of small issues that are annoying. I paid 4 quid for it so it's not too jarring, paying £60 for this would be a mistake."
game servers are riddled with wallhackers/cheaters... no fun at all.
"Frequently crashes with no reason, game just closes itself down and then so does the EA launcher. 

EA are the worst company."
"Could be so much more but it is just not worth three euros.

The mp I did not test since BF V is known as one of the most cheaters infested games. The SP ... only one campaign was actually worth it and that is just almost an hour of gameplay. The rest was bad. Like really awful. You never felt like you were at war. It was badly scripted. I could hear people screaming and charging but there were no AI allies around. I took a whole german HQ by myself. You had to destroy a gun emplacement, you placed TNT but your allies would not move so they blew up along with the gun. The AI had no fear of death. They would just charge against machine guns without a care in the world. Your character would just start talking in french and so you had to read the translation while in front of a bunker shooting at you. Why not say it while in a trench. Once there was a flame thrower chasing one of your guys. Like two idiots running around. It was just so bad. BF 1 was way better. Gladly this game only lasted 4 to 5 hours from which 1 was good. Like why would the other guy start signing while they were charging against us. How did the navy find us. The planes. From where did they come from. Where did the hostage find TNT. The other female character survived a 50 meters fall on rocks. You could freeze to death but the enemy was not affected. Why did closing the generator make it explode. The stories made no sense. Low IQ individuals like whaaaaat???

Very bad. Just avoid!"
I cant even remember the last time EA didnt ruin one of their products.
Cheaters with 100-0 KDA :) Might as well not have anti-cheat at this point.
Way to ruin another game EA. And **** Windows!
"Can't run on Linux/Steamdeck because Dice decided to add EA Anti Cheat 6 years after the game launched.

But to be more specific about the game itself, as I've tried it on Windows, I feel it doesn't have a distinct identity like Battlefield 1 had. The UI and HUD feel and work like a shooter in a modern setting, however this game tries to be WW2 game, which doesn't come across. I like some new additions like the cover you can build, but overall this game feels like a WW2 reskin of a modern shooter.

If you are longing for something thematic and cinematic, give BF1 a try! My favourite Battlefield so far, and I feel Dice had an actual vision for that title."
I do understand that at the time of my review that me game time was 42 minutes. However for 30 of the 42 minutes I was in que to join a game that is apparently not active.
"This game would be fine if the required EA launcher could actually work. I've tried for the past half an hour to get this game to run and nothing works. Don't buy this game unless you want to be met with a company that can't even bother to make the launcher (that they require) work

EDIT: Disabling OneDrive sync seems to fix the issue, but no other game in my steam library has this problem"
"EA is trash. no support to help on account. 
refunding and never buying again an EA game"
"Jesus fucking christ, attacking? Nothing but snipers lining the hills with unerring aim, impossible to push. Defending? Assault units with laser beam guns, can't defend against a hail of bullets. That's the 2 meta play styles I picked up from 1 hour. Going from BF1 to this (not just the whole oh new tech new style of fighting) is dog shit. BF1 has that feel of WW1 anyone can die no matter the weapons, any gun is usable, so why in bf5 am I fighting cod player movement"
This game is contain a lot of cheaters and hackers.
We shouldn't have to watch your cinematics. You have to make these cinematics passable.
"Waste of time and my three bucks. Game is infested with cheaters who run and gun with K/D 80-5 (don't even try to justify that with mythical skills gained by drinking unicorn's piss), If you happen to find clean game you have to deal with one hit shotguns (on top of already ridiculous TTK in general) and people prone in corners, waiting and camping because visibility is horrible. So much fun, no wonder this franchise is dying... which is also apparent by just handful of available servers."
"[h1]WOMEN BELONG IN THE KITCHEN [/h1]

Feminist piece of trash, go subscribe to Undead Chronic!"
A good game but ruined by having to have to EA launcher. 1/10 just bc of that.
the game itself is bad but the launcher sucks
"Nah i rather play Battlefield 1
Also in every Lobby I go when i get 1 lucky kill i get called a hacker..."
"This is the worst game i´ve ever playered!!! The Multiplayer: You spawn, you are already dead (Snipers in the last corner of the map). I got a plane, I spawned with it and got shot by a rocket launcher in under one second. Everyone writes in the chat: Hackers! (or) cheater map if their team lost... Ass mode!!! 

The game has good graphics but the story mode isn´t worth it...

The game isn´t worth it, even if it´s on sale!!! I play rather the new battlefield 1 and this game doesn´t even works sometimes..."
"Can't even start the game it crashes on startup,insane game devs this shit is just a money grab"
"full of hackers or cheater, can shoot through wall, see behind the wall, headshot thing, ngl this game is fun and i dont mind get killed in the game with people that use their skill. not with third party cheaters and spamming in chat so we can chat at all. so dev if u keep those cheaters i would like to say goodbye for all of your games"
"NO RED ARMY IN THE GAME
ZERO OUT OF 10"
to many hackers
i would have gave it 5 stars if they had anti hack support but you don't and as a result hackers are out of control and have ruined the game play. If you sell this game currently i think you owe the customers anti hack support or even a kick feature would be nice.
Can't maintain a connection to the EA servers for more than 3-4 minutes before getting disconnected. Seems like some issue with the EA malware-grade anti cheat system but I can't be asked to troubleshoot it. It's 2024 I should be able to install a new game and it just work. Ridiculous.
What a lazy downgrade from 1
"Game still wont launch a year later, refunded because they cant fix their shit"
"Best game ever, switches you to the losing team right on the verge of winning"
"game constantly crashes in the middle of a match, what a waste of time"
"A mediocre movie plot within the campaigns, somewhat strange historical settings, guns with modern add-ins, and multiplayer littered with ye olde cheaters. Worth of the whole 3 euros, for sure."
error 115 is horseshit and no help via online tech support fuck this game
"""Battlefield V,"" developed by DICE, is a first-person shooter set during World War II. The game offers large-scale multiplayer battles with a focus on squad-based gameplay and historically inspired environments.

While ""Battlefield V"" boasts impressive graphics and sound design, providing an immersive war experience, the game suffers from several issues. The skill gap can be daunting for new players, and the presence of cheaters can significantly disrupt gameplay. Additionally, the complex and often chaotic environments can make navigation and situational awareness challenging.

Pros:

-Impressive graphics and sound design.
-Large-scale, immersive multiplayer battles.
-Variety of historically inspired maps and modes.

Cons:

-Significant skill gap can be frustrating for new players.
-Cheaters negatively impact the gameplay experience.
-Confusing and chaotic environments.
-Some balancing issues.

Overall, ""Battlefield V"" offers an immersive and visually stunning war experience, but the steep skill gap, prevalence of cheaters, and confusing environments may detract from the overall enjoyment. 6/10"
I CANT PLAY THIS SHIT KEEPS CRASHING IT WONT LAUNCH. I HAVE LIKE 10 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY WHICH IS TRYING TO FIX WHATS WRONG WITH THIS GAME.
EA Sucks balls.
"Historically inaccurate. Nobody communicates. Nobody defends. Spawn points are fixed, not movable like hell let loose. Takes a LOT of shots to kill someone."
FUCK YOU EAAPP
it let me play a few months ago and now it saying i need to update my drivers and they are up to date shit fucking game
"I thought I'd pick this up because it was 93% off and seemed like a steal, but the only thing stolen was the hour of my life I wasted on this game. Now, obviously a 5+ year old BF game isn't going to have a huge playerbase, but I thought the solo content might be fun. After nearly half an hour just getting the game to run at an appropriate resolution, I was met with the dullest FPS experience in recent memory. Movement and gunplay feel sluggish and stiff.  It seems like EA tried to pad the runtime by filling short, linear solo levels with a bunch of collectibles. It's just garbage.

For perspective, I paid $3.49 for this game and still refunded it, so that should give you an idea of how bad the game is. If you're reading this, there are much better games to spend your money on. I don't think I could play this if I got it for free."
"Remember when game developers cared about historical accuracy at least a little bit? What ever happened to that? Now it's just about appeasing the people who will never play the games but will whine if they didn't stick a woman in a place where she wouldn't be historically, or sticking a bisexual furry Asian guy in the US Army. It just didn't happen. Sorry"
Just not good👎
"Game suck the movement is dumb the gun recoil sucks, do not recomend this game"
campaign was dook so i tried an online match and got aimbotted the whole time
They just broke this game for all linux users with the new anti cheat. Thumbs down for me
This is a good BF game.You will enjoy it especially when you play with your friends.But you cant play it whenever you want!!! The game doeant launch most of the times! So I give it 2 of 5
Its just not that fun
You know the game sucks when you're on the fence about whether or not you wasted your money after getting it on sale for $3.50
EA
Unplayable due to the EA launcher
NO AMERICAN SERVERS
Botlefield V
"Unknown account ban, no supports, don't buy"
Unlaunchable on Steam. To play this you have to get it on the EA APP only it seems. Running into far too many problems than it's worth trying to run this. The game itself is fun despite the massive historic inaccuracy. Not even gonna request a refund since I got this for only $3.49 during the 2024 Steam Summersale.
Probably the most toxic community I've witnessed.
nope
"Too many cheaters in multiplayer.

The singleplayer campaign is not fun enough."
"they added anti cheat, it did reduce cheating. however, it only reduced it"
"Seems like you haven't unlocked positive review yet, pay additional 29.99$ to unlock positive review and enjoy additional perks, or buy the monthly pass for only 5.99$!"
"Since it’s been on sale four times in a row, every server has been swarmed by the absolute lowest tier of existence. These aren’t players—they’re parasitic, basement-dwelling degenerates with no life, no friends, no future, and no purpose other than to infest games like the human equivalent of malware.

No self-respect. No dignity. No concept of fun or fairness. Just lifeless nobodies who couldn’t achieve anything real if their lives depended on it. They’ve got no goals, no dreams, no motivation, no skills, no talent, and not a single redeeming quality. Their entire personality boils down to cheating because it’s the only way they’ll ever feel like they’ve ""won"" at something. But even then? No one cares.

These bottom-feeders exist in the darkest corners of their mom’s basement, feeding off stale Hot Pockets and internet validation. No courage to face a real challenge, no integrity, no honor. Just pathetic cowards with no ambition, no relationships, no legacy—nothing but a long, sad future of failure and irrelevance.

If they ever saw sunlight, they’d burst into flames. If they tried to play fair, they’d uninstall in shame after five minutes. There’s no hope for them. No redemption. Just a hollow existence fueled by ruining other people’s experiences.

Cheaters: the purest form of human failure."
"Fuck EA
Making me re-buy games
Shitters"
The game would not even start spent an hour trying to fix issue it kept complaining about my drivers but Titanfall2 and all my other games work just fine. Do not waste your time or money
This game is not what Bf should be
"Why there is no USSR?
few EU servers, always full of campers"
"Hope you like dieing every 10 seconds, online games are full of cheaters.  Ruined a potentially great game."
made my dick hurt
EA app and EA Launcher are SHIT AF ... Please Delete YOUR Launcher Electronic Farts . thanks
EA
"I have been playing this game on console and it was very fun!!. But when i played it on PC, there is a lot of players cheating and hacking, especially in Asian servers. I was hoping to get the similar experience i played on console but instead all i got is a bunch of cheating players. What happened to EA? Are they understaffed and can't monitor the older products they have released?? BFV is still a demanding game IMO and they should keep monitoring it to keep out those cheaters out there. As for the cheaters, mate you just suck real bad, i bet your kd ratio without cheats is 0.1, that's why you use the easy way out. Disgusting..."
进去就是卖挂的在刷屏wtf
Bought this on sale for the campaign alone. Wasn't worth it.
not a fan
"This game is overall good, and I would've recommended this game, but I have one complain that is just unforgivable and I am sure I am not alone on.
The EA app is very bad, most of the time it logs me out and doesnt even let me log in showing some error.
I also cannot launch Battlefield V (not sure if its because of the app) because my anti virus flags it or some stupid bullshit like that. For this reason, I cannot recommend this game."
so many cheater and hard to report them in game. Bad UI also
"Game is good, but is full of cheaters, most of the time teams are highly unbalanced, and then there is chat spamming (really annoying, forget texting in game). And it feels like EA don't care. Wish I had known this before buying the game."
"Broken servers and EA app.
So many cheaters, The Anti cheat is not working."
women
어제는 재밌게 했는데 오늘은 실행 자체가 안되네요 무반응이예요
"This is the worst fucking battlefield game that i have ever played, and besides Hardline, I played all of them.

Campaign is one huge shitty terrible joke that should be avoided by all players at all cost. The fact that this game was advertised as realistic WW2 experience is a kick in the balls of every WW2 soldier that fought on the frontlines. You want to play as strong independent woman that single handedly takes down half of the German Army? First, there is something wrong with your head, but you can play as her in this excuse of a campaign. There is nothing enjoyable about BFV stories, its like those open combat missions in MW3 2023. Same shitty idea, same problems.

As for the multiplayer, this is where the downtrend with BF multiplayer began. Weapons have almost no recoil whatsoever, so the only important stat that you need to look out for is the amount of damage that the weapon does. Do you remember that fire spread from all previous battlefield games? That system where the more you fired, the less accurate the weapon would be? Well, its gone now. Hitboxes are downright broken on some bodyparts. For example, I sneaked up on the enemy and shot him in his toe like 10 times, but nothing happened, so he quickly turned and ripped me into shreds. Next time enemy opens fire at me, I quickly hid behind a rock and that same person kills me with a headshot.  Weapons are unbalanced as fuck. Some of them shoot nerf darts, some of them shoot tank shells. Seriously. There are weapons that identify as an Assault Rifle, yet they do less damage then Submachine guns. Historical accuracy is non-existent even with weapons.

Most of the maps suck ass. There are either to big to travel on foot, empty or their design is just terrible. And because of the fucking operator and skin system you cannot identify a friend from a foe. 


This game not only pissed me off, but gave me a seisure as well and made me physicaly sick
Absolutely do not recommend to anyone aside from those cunts that still buy new yearly-cycle games every time. Those idiots consume every shitty AAA game these days."
"The game looks amazing BUTT, gameplay is ASS. So many things wrong like hackers, saving settings is an issue, opening the game just to restart intro EVERY SINGLE TIME. They say triple A, but its TRIPLE ASS. BAD. Even though I got this for 5 bucks, I felt ripped off."
linux gamers cant play this game bc of kernel level anticheat fuck ea
meh
screw EA WORSE PUBLISHER EVER CANT EVEN KEEP A GAME GOING FOR ANYTHING
"Tons of cheaters, dont buy it"
Cheaterfield 5
"This is a good game, what is not good is that the EA launch has to exist. It won't launch my games half the time and this problem has been been continual.

I recommend the game but no the launcher or EA for that matter."
Worse game ever
"this game probably has the most UNPLAYABLE campaign i have ever seen.
EVRYTHING is broken, enemy detection system, their hitboxes, weapons sometimes freezing entirely not letting you reload or to USE THEM AT ALL.
Awful"
sswssss
"they really gotta lower the amount of hackers per game, I've been getting at LEAST 3 each game, of them shooting through walls, flying and not being able to  die. please fix this issue"
too many hackers
This can be a great game but there are so may cheaters playing that it sucks all the fun from the game.
"(Mostly) Good Singleplayer campaigns, but primarily sweats in the multiplayer, not great for beginners."
"tai anticheat nya malah gabisa maen, eror anticheat nya"
Cutscenes were laggy and the gameplay was overall very clunky even just for 30 minutes of gameplay

not working keeps kicking me out of the servers
"the singleplayer campaign is good. the multiplayer? the multiplayer mode is made for hackers, on every server there is always a hackers. and the best part is, the dev does not give a f*ck about this problem, so yeah f*ck the multiplayer mode, i'm uninstall the game after i finish the campaign."
not played for a while and now won't even start. Installed anti cheat as required. Waste of money.
"EA constantly ruining their games, playerbase dropped ever since the last update. Also you can still exploit, so their anticheat solved nothing but crash normal players on the game.

And they broke it for linux users too..."
"si no te mata un hacker el clan stacking te quitara fuerza de vida

added new anticheat that breaks linux compatibility 5.5 years after the release. you cant even play singleplayer anymore. and looking at the reviews it didnt help anyone.

"Recommended for SP.  

Wish they added possibility to play the MP maps in PVE.

Like most of games with PVP, there is no fun in getting on servers with cheaters ... so the multiplayer section of this game i can not recommend.  No fun in there!"
stupid game where you are playing against a team of 10k hour players.
I just wanna leave a negative review to all Battlefields after Battlefield 4
"WOKE everywhere, black nazi, women fight XD I paid 5 euro it isn't worth it. Battlefield 1 >>>>>>>> Batlefield V

YIKES EA WHAT DID YOU LEAVE US WITH
"TOO MANY CHEATERS, SNIPERS ARE UNUSABLE, YOU ARE BASICALLY A BIG SPOTLIGHT THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE WHEN U USE SCOPE"
Game is broken on Steam Deck after the anti-cheat update. Thank you EA for removing Linux support for no reason. Good to see its not doing anything about the hacking issues that are still making this game unplayable in almost every server. Please fix your shitty anti-cheat EA.
"Single player campaign (i don't know about coop) - Very primitive and lazy gameplay, every step taking damage of guns, need to replay, 1st person, only shooting in general - not realistic, not interesting. Short but nice 4 plot stories and graphics. I recommend easy difficulty if you want to buy it anyway and on a huge discount. In some missions you can use a plane or a jeep a little, and even skis. Freezes at the beginning of cutscenes. 
I always recommend buying games at a discount and, if possible, where you really buy it, and not rent while Steam exists or has not sent you to hell. Besides, there is no demo, you might not like the game, etc. And we play most games once, or not at all, why pay tens of dollars - nonsense. And if you play several times a week, you can get into debt within a month. Two hours of play or 14 days will pass and you won’t be able to return it. Plus, many games deceive the buyer, for example, on soulslike it says adventure or impossible to complete without paid modifications, on coop it doesn't say only coop in a franchise that had a single player campaign, or the game is just very boring hackwork with cool advertising or there is an agenda instead of a normal plot with normal characters, etc. The game is easy or well optimized for the first 2 hours, then problems start and you can't return the game. Reviews are bought by game companies. And you agree to some rules, a rule book, who reads that? When you buy food, do you also sign something? Food is even more serious. You write so much so that no one will notice that we have no rights to the goods we bought?! Creatures. Agreement to view some personal data, a microphone, etc., what is that? And if you don't agree, you can't play, it's violence. And how can we filter mixed content, block absolutely everything?? Make censored content, censored versions. So, this is not a kind store, but real thieves, you can’t be generous with them. Instead, they should be judged."
"this is my first ever review on game and this game beyond sht. no anticheat no optimization, spoiled company and EA app just weird than those genders... x.x"
"pathetic revisionist arcade ""ww2 themed"" borefest"
"First battlefield game got on sale and pretty disappointed.

Its got server issues, UI issues, cheaters, and a greedy in-game store, but besides it being an EA game its still got really fun gameplay. Its unfortunate to watch this game be held back by really small issues that could be fixed. idk why you would pay 60$ for any online game if they'll just forget about it and make a new one thats basically the same thing a few years later."
If you want to play against people who TTK (time to kill) you in .1 seconds with 100% accuracy because they have over 3000 hours on the game and probably another 10k hours on other fps games go ahead. Unless you are good at FPS games already you will not have a good time
Crappy campaign that is completely uninspired. I generally don't like playing sets of stories with no common thread. The forced stealth is abhorrent. No matter how good the multiplayer is the campaign should have effort put into it.
shit game :D battlefield 1 is better
just don't work after last update
faced Hacker every game. shit EA can't fix it
"THIS GAME IS STILL AS BAD AS IT WAS 2 YEARS AGO!! laggy, terrible bugs duiring gameplay and within the ""my company bs"" made the game for a woke audience and it shows lmao. ill give it to dice and EA, they did something no one else could: fuck up on a ww2 game lmao"
"Crap netcode and full of aimbot/esp users

Use the spectate feature and watch the top players"

"Need an anti-cheat system, too many hackers -_-
Game is good btw"
They retroactively removed linux support with their new EA anticheat
Bobo kayo tangna nyo
game keeps crashing every 5 minutes
Full of hackers
"Its still possible to enjoy this games content, it adds some good to the franchise but over all its a complete let down even after playing it this late after release. Medics in this game are completely overpowered and can spam heal over and over again while MGs are complete trash, supresion does nothing and you can't aim with the medium machine guns without using the bipod, making you a sitting duck. The worst about this game is the fact that you have to install EA adware to play it. Have fun seeing a small blue box with the words ""Downloading stuff"" when first trying to launch this game, if you're wondering what the hell ""stuff"" might be, feel free to ask the mutli-billion dollar company that made it. Once it's installed it starts everytime you start your computer. Honestly this shit made me stop playing after it locked me out of the game because I didn't remember my EA account password and I couldn't be bothered to go to their dumbass website because you can't reset your password on the popup."
The game no longer launches after EA got rid of the origins app
Just go back to Battlefield 1. Everything you want is there. This game provides none of it.
so many cheating and hacking on this game
ton of cheaters
Pile-o-shit
"The campaigns are still glitchy several years later, had my character get essentially sleep paralysis where i couldnt swap weapons, fire, throw grenades, or any action, could only walk around and look as i got shot to death, had to reset my game to fix it. 1/10. a game this old should not still be in this bad of shape. It has fun moments, but if they cant even get the basic movement and interactions correct, it doesnt bode well for this 6 year old game."
This is a Tutorial on HOW TO KILL A GAME by Electronic Arts.
totally unbalanced game. not fun.
https://store.steampowered.com/app/440/Team_Fortress_2/
EA cut steam deck support so I can no longer play it. Thanks for the stupid anticheat guys.
the amount of cheaters are insane. unplayable dont buy not worth the money.
"Fun game but the hackers suck the fun out of it and for that, I am giving it a dookie"
"I wanted to like this game. I love games based in historical settings, big battles too, but this just isn't scratching that itch. Several things, like the UI elements, the weapon attachments, the absolute historical inaccuracy and the campaign mission structure just feel like a plain old modern game, and that's boring. If we ignore that and simply look at the gameplay, the Singeplayer campaign is forgettable which is more or less the average Battlefield affair since 3. Multiplayer wise, it's a downgrade on the snappy gameplay of Battlefield 1. There are also some balancing issues, like for some reason everybody can heal teammates instead of just Medics, making the already annoying constantly getting back up even more annoying because EVERYBODY is getting back up EVERYWHERE. In other issues, I've heard there are several cheaters, but I'm unsure if I've met any. My main issue with multiplayer was finding an active game more than absolutely anything."
"If call of duty was battlefield, lazer guns, HALO SIGHTS LMAO.  Also it's made for campers, the maps, the foliage. If you play this instead BF1 then you should just play cod since both take equal amount of skill aka point and click. Also bf 2042 is better and 10$ on sale."
"Hackers everywhere still even after the anti cheat system has been put into play, not worth the time or money youll just get 1 tapped by lmg from across the map."
"Do not buy, it's dissipating spending your money on a game just for them to add anti cheat making the game unplayable, cheers ea"
"This is a review based on the multiplayer campaign, I refuse to play the story mode of this abomination.

The time that Battlefield catched up Call of Duty in how bad and random it feels has come. The multiplayer is extremely chaotic and there is no way to balance your experience with it. You get wrecked by tanks and airplanes? You play Assault and can't do anything, because the rocket launchers in this game don't deal damage. You want to wreck with a tank or plane? Suddenly the rocket launchers deal damage that one shots you. You get your butt scooped by one-shots from an Arisaka? Go and try it yourself and it doesn't do horse crap. It feels that every single move in this game skill checks you, but the curve to which you have to adapt and learn to understand when it's time to invoke the necessary skill to survive in the battle is non-existent. You get punished by even doing your role correctly. Do not give any money for this game, its whole existence is in shame for the Battlefield franchise, once better than CoD but now in a worse level than it. Seriously, go play CoD. They are asking the extra money because now, they know they are better."
Too many cheaters. EA cares more about the chat filter than the game
to much hacker

or Playing on Europe / North America, having 300ms ping and can't do any shit other than dying
Cheaterfield V key features :
- Getting shot (even behind the wall) from god who knows place.
- Your enemy have sandevistan or something idk and their movement is so fast you don't even know when they're coming.
- The ""obvious"" pro player on enemy team with fucking 2-3 digits kill and 0 death
- Bot spamming on chat saying god language (guess the country)  and getting censored by EA chat filter (the chat filter feature is better than their Anti-Cheat)
- The overwhelming tank and aircraft on enemy team who always fcking knew your position wherever you are on the map!"

"Meh. 
Purchase it on sale if you can."
terlalu banyak cheater
fuck ea they broke the game on linux due to the new anti cheat
"Haven't played in forever
Game updated anti-cheat to break on Linux/Steam Deck months ago, and it didn't fix hackers in the game from my research, can't even play campagin, EA once again proving its the worst company ever."
mybe im noob but i dont know how to start story singleplayer mode
"TOO MANY HACKERS, AND NEED ALOT OF BANDWIDTH TO PLAY"
Planes are too OP compared to previous games.
Impressively unfun for a battlefield game.
not working on steamdeck
"Not really very fun. I only care for building barricades because it reminds me of playing CoD Zombies, which is a far more enjoyable experience. After playing a couple more hours, I can confirm that the game is absolute dogwater with rampant cheating. We're talking some guy on the opposite side of the map spraying randomly with an SMG and one shot headshotting everyone in his cone of vision. This game also censors you as much as possible. You cannot say ""Nazi"" in this WW2 game, nor can you say ""this game sucks"" without your message being blocked. Play something else.

Even without the cheating and censorship, the guns suck, the time to kill is wack, and having to pick up medkits and ammo every time you spawn is cumbersome. I play as a support player with ammo packs and as soon as the round starts, I have to spam ammo packs so my team can start the match with a decent amount of ammo. It's ridiculous and totally rips you out of your immersion. Generally, I avoid the combat entirely in this shooter game because making sandbag forts and digging trenches is a lot more fun than getting laser'd to death in the blink of an eye. Also, there's somehow very few enjoyable weapons in this game? Not sure how they managed that but I felt like I was done with progression only a few hours in because most guns aren't super recognizable or cool looking. And there's only a handful of bolt-action sniper rifles in the game for some reason??? You'd be surprised by how hard it is to come across a bolt-action rifle in this WW2 game, actually. Even worse, most of them have really bad damage output. Regularly, I had to 3-shot someone with my sniper because they just wouldn't go down. There is very little purpose in playing as a sniper. Very few LMGs as well."
Hackers. So much hackers that you can't enjoy the game. And EA isn't doing anything to stop it.
"a bAdmin banned me cus i was hitting headshots with a sniper. what was i supposed to do, aim for legs?"
ea play will not send verification so that you can connect the game ive been waiting a week for my email code from them so i can play this game and nope nothing ive had this problem before to with other games sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt
"Infested with hackers and edgy people, very disappointed with this game."
Just dont. BF has been over its top and has been going downhill steadily. This game is no exception. There are other games out there that do this alot better.
dgoshit game
"laggy mess, gameplay is fun, developers are lazy and cant even manage to load in simple stuff like skins which you can purchase with real fucking money, but first things first you have to install ea's shitty fucking launcher which nobody wants"
"All of the BS apps, and accounts need to play a mid game is ridiculous, EA account, origin sign in, EA anti cheat, EA/origin App. Never buying EA games again and uninstalling."
"Cheaters Cheaters Cheaters.... whats the point of a such an Anticheat, when absolutely every third player is a cheater... can't recommend."
"Pile of trash. EA is such garbage company. can't even login and play the game.
keep getting""Sorry, we've encountered an error.
Please try again in a few minutes."" 
I only wanted to play campaign"
Every Lobby I can see 3 to 4 cheaters running fast like rockets with aimbots and the worst thing is the bullets can pass through walls and land so you will die even if you do your best to hide behind things. Not Recommended
Second worst game I've ever played
Anti cheat doesn't work at all. Frequent disconnections.
"There are way to many hackers in this game for me to recommend it. It has had the most cheaters out of all the bf I have played. And I mean like aimbotting lmg for everybody to see and spamming the n word and so on.
But in rarer cases you also get cheaters in vehicles which is also a great time :I 
Anyway I would skip this game, It might not be bad in concept but if you wana play the multiplayer you should consider a different one."
"They bricked their game for linux users, thanks EA, go fuck yourselves"
I can't even open the game I bought after the anti-cheat update.
"Game doesn't even launch anymore. Asking me to install EA anticheat which i already have and continues to validate.After validation it just closes and does nothing about it. Trying to launch it again will have the same outcome. I unistalled and re-installed it twice and same thing happened. Checked a bunch of bugs about it online, nothing helped.
* If you are looking for a game that works , look somewhere else*"
AntiCheat Scumbags at EA Suck Windows Dick!
"Okay, I have no idea how these big companies can't get even basic settings right...I have a separate mic and right now am using a BT headset for audio. The game automatically picks up my BT headset as a mic, so I have no audio going to my headphones and my ACTUAL FUCKING MICROPHONE is not picked up. Ofc, there is also no manual setting in the game, for which mic to use.

This is a 5yo game, how the hell such a basic setting is not in the game?"
would be much better if u coild remove HDR
"Hello old friend lets play again, booted up after a long time.
Went in to multiplayer, we where winning the first 100 points, had fun!!!
Than the enemy started hacking (wallhack and aimbot), my team left the game and at the end we lost.
Uninstall the game again, goodbye my old friend!"
"All of the official servers are full of cheaters. EA needs to get out of their disgusting habit of dropping support for their games within 3 years of release if they want anything resembling a loyal fan base. I've played every Battlefield title except for Hardline since BC2. This is one of my favorites, but the cheaters make any official server unplayable. Bravo EA."
i dont like it that much
Dead Game with lots of Hackers you wont enjoy it and you will throw your money by buying this game really dont know how Steam allow such apps that the only possible way to play it is to have a hack software which is for sure a malware MY ADVICE DONT PLAY A GAME THAT REQUIRES HACK AND NEVER USE HACK
a mouse is in the middle of my screen when playing on controller
Its really hard to enjoy this game with all the hackers its a shame I can't recommend this.
eeeeee
"garbage game, lots of hackers"
Hack & cheating
this game can't run
"All of a sudden a kernel-level anti-cheat was introduced. No thanks. I'd get a refund if I could. The game was filled with cheaters after some time, but this is not the solution."
"Unplayable on my system because of the new anti-cheat. It is flat out incompatible with my system.

I'd honestly have preferred if they'd used EAC, BattlEye, and Denuvo simultaneously instead of this stupid anti-cheat from EA itself. I guess if people can't even play this game in good faith, then cheaters can't play it either.... But I'll be getting a refund."
"Sorry guys but BF 1 is much much better, no kids with spaming guns....
 If you are a sweet BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
AAA Shit
bad
The game is okay..
"bf 1 was better, too many bug on this shit"
I hate this game so much but it keeps dragging me in how do i fix this
"Worst fps game I've ever played, it has its good moments sometimes despite frustrating mechanics , but the overall experience in the story mode has been pretty bad and the online is dead. The story is stupid and pointless, the playability is boring and repetitive, but the worst of it all is the design of environment and gun funcionality. When an npc is behind a window frame or heavy machinegun he can't be killed for no reason even if you can see half his body, which makes no sense, edges of structures appear to end so I can snipe above them but the bullets stops as if its hittin a wall so the bullet trayectory doesnt match the environment, making sniping very frustrating and unrealistic. and  even worse, I constantly get to a place where all guns just stop working, can't use them or switch them and have to go back to the last checkpoint or reset the game to  fix it. I got it on 85% off so it's ok for the good graphics I guess, but it's totally not worth the full price. I wonder if my copy is just damaged or the game is actually this bad."
"Was pretty fun, then they added EA Anticheat. This did not fix the cheating issue and dropped support for the Steam Deck and Linux. My favourite part is the fact they did this years later."
Cheaterfield
so many hackers and their friends sucking them off trying to gas light you into thinking they aint hacking. thank you EA for pushing out a kernel level anti cheat that has done absolutely nothing but keep Linux players from being to play.
"Very irritating game. Most of the time one time is either being destroyed or you are completly dominating due to hackers. ""Redeployments"" happening most of the time due to reason whatsoever. Really annoyed with this game whilst I had highest of the hopes for it."
"actual goyslop,  battlefield has become so terrible."
"Dont waste your money. There's a lot of flaws that matter to some people but don't to others, but gamebreaking bugs like not being able to do anything but move randomly until you die are present and due to age, multiplayer is dead. Also the few alive lobbies i found had a hacker that made it unplayable"
84784
PvP has ton of hacks. PvE cant even work.
"Head shooting in every shot? 
Switches team mid-game?
1-man wipe the entire 32-man team?
360+ kills after 10+ mins game?

God damn this game has a lot of cheaters."
"expectations were very high, i am disappointed("
We would have lost the war if real soldiers were as stupid as the guys in the campaign
Scheiße
"If 2042 didnt exist, this would be the worst one"
"Yknow, after playying for a while...it's just not as fun as other earlier Battlefield titles. the TTK and balancing of both map design and equipment is less polished. The multiplayer playlists, how maps are categorised is poor. Personally, unsatisfying progression. The character customisation, at first seemed a cool addition but then, the pacific campaign is mostly neglected and pushes the cash shop.
Just not as fun. Maybe its just me, but nah. It's a shame.
Going back to Battlefield 1"
"Tbh, its bad game, Thought its something similar to H&G but its awful because every game as a cheater in it. No point to play such game."
"Where I don't care about Social Justice, I do care about Historical Accuracy, especially when it comes to a game that claims, that by playing you can ""Immerse yourself in the hard-fought battles of World War II"". In reality? That's all bullshit. Women weren't allowed to serve as frontline soldiers; they were ALLOWED to enlist, that's true, but their role was more as a support than a avarage soldier. Even the flag of the German Reich was changed to the flag of German Empire. The flag thingy I could understand since it's a mainstream game and the flag is banned in several countries,BUT they removed ANY mention of German Reich from the game. However historical accuracy isn't the main issue with the game. Game is full of cheaters, toxicity, bugged AI, boring and borderline shit campaigns, and a few game modes are dead. There's also absolutely no skill or balance in this game; the higher the fire rate of a weapon, the more kills you get. You can't win with high fire-rate weapons unless you have god like reflexes and aim. Game is also full of microtransactions, where you either grind to level up and do DAILY and MONTHLY missions to gain small amount of points to unlock cosmetics or you spend real money to unlock stuff. And also if you aren't in the loop, EA is a awful company. So yeah. I suggest you buy something else if you want an FPS set in World War II it's going to be 100 times better than this.

SO MANY CHEATERS
"7,49$ on sale for a broken game which crashesh"
"I don't recommend this game because it crashes mid game and i tried everything and its still wont work.
Fix your game."
always game disconnected. cant play multiplayer. suck game
"battlefield requires a special type of skill, and that is a skill i am lacking in.
also all the ""popular"" gamemodes have literally NO-ONE in them, so stop lying, they arent ""popular"""
You get killed by japanese women wielding katanas. Also there is no russian faction. The tanks are the only thing fun in this game and most maps you have to spam click on the icon just to be able to spawn in one. Overall seems like a very hastily put together game with zero care or respect for historical accuracy. Battlefield 1 is better.
"Only the Stories, I don't like online play:  Enemies are invulnerable standing behind an MG-42 on a tripod.  Whenever the game finally provides a sniper rifle, you only get 6 cartridges.  For some reason enemies that have flamethrowers also have super-bulletproof armor that did not exist in the 1940s.  HEADSHOTS DO NOT KILL IN ONE HIT.  The franchise is called BATTLEFIELD, not ONE PERSON WITH  ONLY A KNIFE TAKING ON THE ENTIRE GERMAN ARMY ALONE.  The stories railroad you through annoying low-visibility map zones, forcing you to sneak and execute espionage missions rather than fight in open large-scale battlefields in chaotic combat.  Also, these games no longer feature destructible ground and bullet trajectories determined by gravity.  Bad Company 2 is one of the best games I've ever played.  That game should have been the standard for all later franchise releases.  BC2 and the prologue of Battlefield 1.  BFV is not sniper/rifleman-friendly.  Also, every enemy aims at you, the player, only.  Developers should never sacrifice realism to make the game more OR less challenging.  There seems to be no single-player content for the Pacific theater, as I was misled to believe there would be by the videos and images on the Steam store page.  Fortunately I only paid $7.49 for this."
ugh!
"In my short time playing
Every single map I have played has massive stretches of open ground between most objectives
Weapons do back-flips in my arms whenever I try to shoot them
People eat more round than in any other Battlefield title I've played
Vehicles do not PTFO, they sit on hills with the snipers and snipe
Servers don't seem to support 128 players, 64 only, minus the snipers you maybe have 20 players a side"
"this thing is not good for new players, is your new to battlefield not get it i deleted it already"
"A HUGE NO. 
Bought this game on Steam but it also uses EA Play to open. Tried to get into few games, keeps disconnecting from online ""YOU HAVE LOST CONNECTION TO THE EA SERVERS""

 No wonder why is at price 7,49E.

Once again EA games doesn't stop to dissapoint people.  Just asked for a refund.."
"Hackers ALOT, terrible team balancing"
"THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!

I lied

Have some self respect and play Battlefield 1 instead."
"The game is solid, but hackers ruined the game for me.  1 in 3 matches I have run ins with hackers either on my team or the opposing team.  Not fun.  Imagine getting headshotted in a building under cover by someone clear on the other side of the map.  I've gotten headshotted while running through the subway map by players hiding in buildings, at their map starting location, on the surface, blocks away.  The hackers don't even hide what they are doing they just find a spot deep in their territory and rotate like a turret shooting everyone, everywhere.  

If they ever address the hacker problem in multiplayer, I'd recommend this game."
"bear witness to cheaters!
チーター、ご照覧あれい！
前有掛狗，敬請見證！"
"Big NO!!!! this game still full of cheaterssss!!!! no matter how strategic how you play it, you still can't outrun player with super speed, zero recoil, ultra long shot and map hack!!!! don't waste your time and money"
Still full of cheaters save your money.
looks worse and runs worse than battlefield 1. riddled with cheaters. a downgrade from battlefield 1.
I was able to finally able to connect with my grandpa. He started freaking out when he saw he run around with a shotgun.
yarrak gibi bir oyun sunucularda denge diye birşey yok şuana kadar oynadığım çok nadir olarak zevk aldığım anlar vardır. Sunucularda Denge yok Ya bir taraf çok güçlü ya bir taraf çok güçsüz. ya bir takımda 10 tane 150 lvl (full level) oyunu bilen kişiler var yada diğer takımda sadece 2 tane 150 lvl bazense 0 lvl insan var. yani denge diye birşey yok bok gibi
"I used to be able to launch the game, but now it just keeps crashing on launch. Tell me if you know how to fix this."
Soon we can enjoy ads while getting killed by hackers!
"Very boring, small maps, not a lot of maps, Operations is boring, tons of useless cosmetics that destroy the atmosphere of the game, dont buy this game."
infinite loading during the game. uninstalled.
"honestly still worse than 2042 which was also terrible. so many hackers, terrible TAA filter that makes everything blurry, abandoned by EA etc. just buy bf1 or bf4 instead"
"Help, i play with my friends in Combined Arms mode, but it's not working; after loading a few sec, my friend cancelling squad ??? How i can fix it ????"
"Bought this game because friends wanted to play.
Looks ok, but the gameplay is horrible.
There is no match making, so if you're not good, you'll just be insta killed all the time.
Wish i would've gotten a refund in time."
It was a good game but it's now unplayable because of the new anticheat.
"Battlefield 1 has better maps, servers, performance, graphics, and gameplay."
"Game is fun but completely broken by hackers. You will have to switch servers constantly because there are people who are aimbotting, speedhacking, respawning the whole server constantly, auto scanning for airplanes and more. The most blatant hacking ive seen in years. Do not buy if you are planning to seriously play this game and try to get good at it."
Wouldnt launch
Amazing game but amazing cheater too
"There's no progression since the only version of the game you can buy now comes with the stupid ""Pay money to unlock literally every item!"" thing so levelling up does nothing."
no bots to create own server dog sh how do you not add bots and give you the freedom to make your own private lobby rtrds
EA sucks meat thangs
Constant disconnections fuck EA suck my ding dong.
"3/10 and then only for online. The company is made very poorly. The main problem is changing the story and it would be fine to just change it, so there are also constant errors in the form of: 1 Disabling the interface (when you can't do anything) right during the game (not during cutscenes, but right in the game). 2 Texture patching. 3 Constant detection by the bot when it is not looking in your direction. 3 The lack of a cartridge in the new weapon (just a clip and that's it). 4 The inability to skip a video (when it always was, and then at one point there is no video), etc. But the biggest problem is not even related to the company, I'm talking about the constant intro that cannot be skipped or removed (and okay, the first time it's beautiful, but when you enter the game 5 times it starts to anger you) and you can only remove it yourself. Bottom line: the game is raw, they just created a normal online for pumping money, and they scored a bolt for the most interesting thing."
"Battlefield V could have been a masterpiece, thanks to its powerful engine and innovative gameplay, but it seems the developers decided to bury its potential under the weight of historical inaccuracy. It's like buying the latest car model with the most advanced technologies, only to find out it can't go faster than a tricycle.

The game, which could have revived historical battles with unprecedented accuracy, instead presents itself as an empty museum exhibit—beautiful, but soulless and meaningless. The developers of Battlefield V seem to have forgotten that games are not just entertainment, but also a storytelling medium capable of inspiring and educating. They chose to ignore an entire chapter of history, depriving players of the opportunity to experience it for themselves.

The lack of the ability to play as the Soviet Union in Battlefield V is not just an oversight; it's a historical injustice. After all, some of the most significant and bloody battles of the war took place on the Eastern Front. Ignoring such a fact is not just a lapse in game design, but a collapse in historical accuracy.

Apparently, DICE assumed that 85% of German soldiers on the Eastern Front simply died of exhaustion while wandering through the vast USSR.

Battlefield V is as realistic as the movie ""Cowboys & Aliens."" A game that could have become a classic will now be remembered as an example of how not to make historical shooters. The developers didn't just miss an opportunity—they actively rejected it, preferring sterile fiction over living history. This is not just an oversight; it's a betrayal of the memory of those who fought and died defending the world.

A game that could have been a bridge between the past and the present has instead become a reminder that history can be rewritten or forgotten if we are not vigilant."
"got the game, it was running fine and i enjoyed it until i started getting disconnected from ea servers every 5 minutes,
tried every google solution but nothing works, now its unplayable for me."
**** this ******* shit **** game fix your app EA
"游戏是好游戏    就是这个EA APP登录很恼火    花钱买罪受      每次登录都要整很久
不晓得这鬼EA的工程人员是辞职了吗    进个游戏都那么恼火

always find cheaters in every match
still runs doesnt run very good
"If you enjoy constantly being killed by cheaters in tanks, this is the game for you"
CRASH MULU ANJIR
"hackers in official dice server
hackers in robot servers.
hackers even with EA anticheat."
"If EA not solve hacker problem, this game will ruin all your expectations of it, If you have a 1:1 or 1:6 chance of encountering cheats in other games, then you will experience a 1:50 or even 3:50 experience with cheats in this game"
Bored game
new anticheat blocks people from playing on linux using proton. terrible decision from EA as usual.
"Game is good but it is unplayable on Asian official servers because of cheaters with instakill/aimbots. You have to join community games but unfortunately most of them doesn't allow you to use the fun stuff like shotguns,  self loading rifles, and anti materiel rifles."
It's just call of duty with way too many vehicles. Miserable
"Tl; dr
Game looks good and is illogical and humorously unrealistic. 

Advertised as realistic, which is not the case. It got some minor things correct like not including a Sturmgewehr 44 in a campaign which takes place in 1943. At the same time, it gives the player a reflex sight on a Thompson with a 50rd drum mag which holds 30 rounds. A suppressed gun in the first level which appears to be firing a pistol caliber (it seems as if it was feeding from 1911 mags) does more damage when hitting the torso then a 98k. 

A rifle caliber is outclassed by a .45 acp at range.

On hard mode (I don't know about the others) enemies take 3 or 4 bullets to take down and just keep walking as if nothing happened. I put two 7.92 mm bullet in a guy’s torso, and he was still fighting as if nothing happened. The Flak has almost no drop. 

You can attack the bombers which fly around passively while doing stunts??? And I hit them a bunch of times and they do not seem to take damage nor go down or change their behavior. Maybe it was just coincidence though.

The beginning of the story seems illogical too. Why send someone who is visibly unwilling to cooperate with authorities to the enemies of said authority? And doing all that in a mission where desertion would be a piece of cake. 

The Germans in the campaign also shoot Panzerfausts at you, despite those being anti-tank weapons featuring shaped explosives which are best used for armor, a grenade or simply attempting to shoot the enemy would be a far better choice. Enemies also track you through terrain. Rocks are also modelled poorly; sometimes thick rocks simply get shot through and serve no purpose other than contributing to the game’s great landscapes. 

It looks good, maybe that is something that speaks for it, I guess.

Just for context, I used to be a Tarkov enjoyer with a love for games such as warthunder and Mil-Sim. I love RoN and Insurgency Sandstorm despite them not trying too hard to achieve realism. With a game wanting to tell fictional stories about actual events in real life realism has got to play a factor. Maybe it was designed like this for the purpose of playability and user experience, but with the number of bullets enemies take to go down I cannot disagree more intensely.

But maybe I am just too autistic for fun though."
So buggy
"Lots of bugs af, not recommended to buy"
"Not fun to play, huge downgrade from BF1. It's like they weren't even trying with this ""WW2 game"". Don't recommend it even on sale.

Edit: And what's up with all these super restrictive gameplay mechanics (no full auto heal, low ammo count, can't self repair vehicle etc.)?? 
Call me a casual, but it feels like I'm being forced to play this game on hardcore mode when I really don't want to. Makes it all the more difficult for beginners to compete."
"fuck you EA!! bullshit anti cheat my ass... cheaters is everywhere, they have no balls, no bitches, no shame and no parents."
WILL ban me on EA Play for offending Chinese Cheaters. WON'T Ban said Chinese Cheaters
good game. but cheating every match.
Combined arms is unplayable because of all the loading problems
"This game was great. It lived up to the hype. Then EA found out they were doing good on player amount and player happiness was high. So they made the game only launch from their crappy launcher, forced their anitcheat that will not work, and refuses to do anything about it because they have a new game out now that is the worst battlefield ever made. I want to play this game with my friends soo bad but im stuck going through EA game launcher. Also when i finally get into a match i get killed instantly by some hacker with 200:0 kd. gaming is dead and EA made it happen"
"Had tons of fun playing this on the steam deck, now after an update anticheat prevents boot. EA is so lame nowadays"
thats fucked up
"game stuck on loading screen permanently right after i bought it, that's a start.
someone link my Steam Account to a random EA account, the EA support is shit, they hide the support button on their website, wont respond to my ticket, and whenever i try to chat on their website, it says ""error, wait for a while"" something like that and after i waited, the fucking notification said time out.

fixed the issue about infinite loading screen, try to join a match and then the issue went back on.
and also
EVERYTIME you turn on your PC, you will be greeted with the shittiest logo of your life

game is a mess, not worth your time"
cheters aimbot speehack  jeast bad experince vs cheaters
"I'm extremely disgusted by the ""developers"" and investors of this ""game studio"". They just brought a kernel-level spyware (what they call anticheat - don't forget it's for ""our safety"") as an update to their newer ""games"", funnily this also includes Battlefield V since last month, even though it's an older game.

This breaks playing the game on Linux, for the ones that cannot care less about Linux gameplay, this introduces a massive security/privacy-hole into your system. We don't know what they exactly collect, where this gets all uploaded, when they are doing this - since everything is uploaded encrypted and the source of it not available.

As a gamer it's your duty to stfu and swallow the pill. It is way too obvious this ""game studio"" does not care about it's customers anymore. They will also include that kernel-virus with newer releases as well. I won't update the games I have from them anymore, won't buy newer ones. Then they have the audacity to lecture us about piracy.

Since this rollout happened silently and not many noticed the ""game studio"" is not getting enough heat. I would say do your part for anybody reading this."
"Does not support use of Wine for Linux users for some reason out of no where with the past updates.
Dumb.

Get Funked EA no longer supporting the PUBLISHER and urge others to do the same."
"Between the non-monitored chat & hackers I cannot recommend. Seems to lack some balance; getting shot through walls, too many snipers allowed, medic speed is abused, very slow time to raise your weapon to shoot on mouse/keyboard but not controller, and player upgrades for those with many hours makes them harder to kill. Many times I've pumped someone with 5+ rifle rounds to the upper body only for them to take me out with one shot using a pistol as they side swipe/slide right at me, a virtually impossible move on keyboard. Being that upgrades can be purchased with $$ (in game currency) this borderlines a ""pay-to-play"" advantage. I also notice a lot of new players frustrated as their XP is weak & player moves/weapons/vehicles are poor while high hour players have complete advantage; speed, weapons, vehicle repairs & hit points, and not to mention the squad wiping bombs that only higher hour players can use in-game. I have given this game try after try yet it is very hard to get good or enjoy unless you are a master FPS player or have the cash to burn. It doesn't help that many players camp out the spawn points, driving away many new & existing players. One match we were down to 5? players against 20 others because people were so frustrated with being farmed at spawn they quit or restarted on another server. Have also noticed that building with mouse/keyboard is slower & glitches more than with a controller. Try for yourself if you wish but the first time your entire team gets bombed by an airplane immediately after spawning into a new match or you encounter the other major issues I have then you will feel the same about the game as thousands of other do especially when the hardcore high-hour players openly chat about ""spanking the noobs"" or some other racist or vulgar slander against new players giving the game a chance. Other fps games have similar issues to a point but they also seem to have a moderator presence unlike BF5 or a functional way to report issues."
"I do not know what they did to the game with the recent update(s), it literally broke my PC. I've had 3 Blue Screens, 1 CTD, and 3 freezes (when I had to manually reboot my computer) all in a single day. Mind you - all other games, including EA games, such as Battlefield 1, launch without an issue."
Literally unplayable. Just downloaded the game and can't run it due to anticheat
"no skateboards, this game SUCKS"
"Cheater infested sewer. People actually play as groups to cheat. It's actually funny to see people with CLAN tags cheat through the match like it is part of the core gameplay. If you are gonna buy this game, just make sure that you are okay with cheaters and have no trouble leaving the match and finding another."
white screen on startup thanks losers
Electronic ARTifacts.
EA KONTOOOOOOOOL
this is a trash
"Unplayable. Doesn't even launch anymore. 
Just ends up ""validating"" in an endless loop that you can't fix. I've edited the registry, I've uninstalled and reinstalled this game, Steam, EA Launcher and even my operating system several times. I've moved the game and all launchers to different hard drives, etc. No luck.

Absolutely useless garbage and waste of money. 
This is what happens when you focus on maximising the amount of money you can suck out of customers instead of using profits to ensure a decent game service. 

I do not recommend this game."
crashes every 2 seconds
"After they added the new EA Anti-cheat, I get constant stuttering and the game is unplayable."
"Bought for $7 and while this game is obviously a well polished Battlefield game with tons of content, it wasn't worth it due to the prevalence of cheating in multiplayer. Received a refund thankfully."
Most dogshit game of all time
"Game sucks, the tanks have no physical weight to them, so you end up flying when you hit a trench or sand bag, anything to fricking launch you into the air. takes 30+ rounds to kill someone, going back to HLL, which is an actual game, not whatever this bull*cks is supposed to be. EA when you gunna make a game that's half decent again? and provide servers that prevent hackers from getting in"
"Tried playing through the single player campaign for the achievements. I don't want to finish it anymore. Over 5 years after launch and there are still game breaking bugs, causing enemies in a stealth mission to spawn behind you and alert, your weapons to disappear after swapping too fast, and the dynamic lighting system leaving you blind after crossing thresholds. Not to mention any issues with the multiplayer"
Can't play with my friends and it kick us out of team many time
"After I installed the EA anticheat I couldn't open the game. Literally uninstalled EA and Battlefield V over 3 times. Nothing changed, did all steps on the internet to troubleshoot the issue to no avail. You ruined the game."
cheaters everywhere!!!!
"Listen, this game is absolutely fantastic. The way it's designed, it fully immerses you into the imagination of being a soldier in WWII, the mechanics are satisfying, the guns feel real.

Everything is great, right up until you watch a soldier - on foot - moving at 150km/h and firing his M1 Garand at 20 rounds per second. Hmmm, something doesn't add up there, no?

So you think to yourself, ""Surely they aren't.... cheating?""

Check the scoreboard;
90+ kills
0 deaths

Then you report them. And leave. Find another match;

Apparently the Germans had a living, breathing superman in their army because now you have a guy zooming around, knowing where everyone is, annihilating your entire team.

I've requested a refund because I had about 4 or 5 games in a row like this, with someone blatantly cheating and ruining the immersion into what should have been the greatest WWII simulator ever made."
Worst fucking multiplayer experience. Why can't you fuckers solve the cheating problem? Literally every single multiplayer game has cheaters on it.
2/3rd of all your matches will be ran by cheaters who don't even hide it cause they don't get banned. Bonus points if they're from another server like china cause they like to server hop to spread their degeneracy of ongoing rampant cheating.
"As I stated in the refund request:
Hell Let Loose is a superior game in every conceivable way."
Somehow worse than 2042
"Impossible to play on linux, also lmao @ that guy who told me not to buy the game (never did)"
"DONT BUY THIS GAME developers give big discounts on games...beause in the game cheaters are still roaming around...like wallhacks, run very fast in the game...different from other players...DEVELOPER sucks"
hackers and politicians are the worst people on the planet
"This is basically similiar to enlisted, not as i expected, play battlefield 1 its better

will refund"
"i Really want to like the game but the amount of cheaters and neglect of them is astonishing. they dont even hide that they are cheating, they rub it in your face because EA and DICE wont do anything. oh they came in a lot of flavor too, starting from the usual wallhack and 1 hit kill to the speed hack, the camping beyond the map hack, to infinite ammo hack so they spam grenade and stuff. they do it in YOUR FACE, they want you to know that they are cheating. unbelievable. 

dont even get me started on the whole Origin or whatever EA wanna call it nowadays, it complicated things, i just wanna play with my friends but i gotta go through a whole heap of mess just to accept a friend request so we can invite each other in game."
"Good graphics, weak gameplay. Brainless shooter."
"[b] In 2024, a company like EA shouldn't allow itself to use such a crappy launcher that doesn't allow me to play in peace. I wish the worst to that failure who programmed the launcher. [/b]"
game is horrible ea is a shit heap of a company have 35 mins from literally just trying to get it to launch garbage game its so sad too bc i loved this game had like 1k hrs on console and they cant figure out how to get the game to run on pc sad
game runs like garbage
F_CK EA
Its very buggy and im still not even able to play after a day of trying everything
"EA taints everything it touches. Wiped my account clean on multiple games, including this one."
....
"There's seriously Zero point of even playing online games anymore! You can't play anything without running into cheating scum! Well, good thing I only paid 7 dollars! If it's not single-player, I'm not buying it anymore. Tired of wasting my money and I can't even play the game fairly because of cheating scum. I seriously only played 2 matches and ran into 3 people spawning in behind you constantly and snapshotting you in the dome every time you run into to them and there's no time to even react to them. Cheating 100%. Anti-cheat my ass."
Couldn't get a single game without a hacker in it.
"The anticheat is so invasive that it will slow down your system even when the client isn't open (I'm talking like a slideshow when I start my computer sometimes on a 7800 X3D and a 7900XT), and it is so ineffective that it still fails to stop a significant portion of cheaters. I don't care how fun the game might be; that is completely unforgivable. Especially considering how shitty EA is as a company on top of this glaring flaw, don't spend a single cent on this game. If it was completely free with no micro-transactions, it still wouldn't be worthwhile."
"played BF1 for 500+ hour, feel that BF5 Kind of suck compair to BF1, graphics is worse and needs a better gpu, motion of the characters are way less smooth than BF1. 
The major problem is that you can't feel the intense feeling of battle field anymore, sniper rifles are very terrible can't aim accuratly with iron sight anymore, UI is much more complicated
very few community servers, you wouldn't want to go to official servers cause all kinds of cheaters and game hack adv
missed the refund time and wasted me $8 when I bought it with discount, could have done so much things with it other than buying this game.
everyone do not get fooled by the CG above, this game does not worth it, not at least $8"
"before the new anti cheat it was meh
now i can't even play the game >:("
Bait and switch to a kernel level malware anti-cheat
"So, I have ReWASD installed due to cubital tunnel syndrome.
My pinky and ring fingers basically barely work on my left hand due to compression of the cubital nerve running through the elbow. Use of the two fingers has become arduous.
I use ReWASD to map a joystick to wasd movement, without any controller functionality remaining, all so that I can still play otherwise normally with a mouse.

I would be willing to take a step back, playing with only a controller, if it would let me. But you see...

As a result of the program being installed, not even running, I am incapable of playing Battlefield V. In fact, having uninstalled the software, scouring the registry for any entries that needed removal, and restarted, I still cannot play.

As a result, I'd say is that what I have seen is pretty great.

EA, reminder that instead of blocking players from starting the game when ReWASD is detected, you can just do what ""The Finals"" does and disable Aim Assist. Y'all are a riot these days."
would be more fun without tanks and planes - theyre so OP you can't stay alive more than 30 seconds. luckily i bought this game for $7 not $60 - which is a scam. buy this game if you suck at fps and rather sit in a vehicle to get all your kills
Bought it on sale only for last tiger
what is this shiaat
Unplayable. Game doesn't work. Can't review game because it literally wont open.
linux support is now borked!
Cant play the game anymore
Can't even launch the game
stinky sweats
Worse than previous Battlefields in all aspects. Holy s***.
Shits worse than 2042
EA anticheat didn't do shit still full of hackers
at first i like the game but now its lagging
FUCK YOU EA LAUNCHER
"Can't call this a Battlefield, shit maps.. 
BF1942 & BF2 and BF4 are the best Battlefields"
"Used to work, now it doesn't. Just let us play the game instead of forcing me to run an OS I don't want to, or install some trojan keylogger crap.

Companies ought to be required to give a refund when they break something you bought"
Cant get to start with all sign in requirements
"EA's anticheat can't stop cheater, but stop me logging.
Very nice EasyAntiCheat, make the progress bar slow.
HEAT FROM china."
"Game is absolutely beautiful and game-play is absolutely great. But multiplayer, them servers specially the asian servers are rigged with hackers and EA gives 0 shit about this. The asian server chat box are spammed by hackers that will snipe you from miles away no matter if they are playing infantry or flying a god damn plan. They just single or double tap you no matter where you are. And this ""You have lost connection to the EA server, connection offline"" error, your dumbass server is the actual issue EA. Origin was way better than your crap."
"Game is unplayable on my laptop with a 4060, crashes constantly to point of being unplayable, will load into a match, sometimes won't even load, walk ten feet then the game will just close to the desktop with no crash reporter or anything popping up, this is entirely ridiculous.

By far the worse battlefield ever made, the vehicles are horribly unbalanced, every gun feels downright god awful to use, the maps are downright terrible and will lead to getting spawn camped almost every singe match, not to mention the absolute unplayable amount of cheaters on the official dice servers, just save your time and energy and go play the new cod because despite that game being a burning pile of garbage it is still better than this."
Cheaterfield™ V
No longer supports Proton.  COD and BF can go to hell.
"If you wan't to be bombarded by Plane sweating people go ahead, otherwise better not buy it. As usual for EA their games are not like they used to be."
"I have about 80 hours in Battlefield V from my time of playing it through EA Play.

Breakthrough player here, I love the Battlefield games, this used to be one of my favorite games. The start was rocky, but it picked itself back up. However, time and time again, this game has been ruined by cheaters. Today, it's worse than I ever remember it. I CANNOT play this game without encountering someone blatantly cheating and killing me from across the map upon peaking a corner that there was no possible way that player could have known I was hiding at. Dice added a new kernel level anticheat that was supposed to remedy this problem, but it didn't do anything. I still encounter so many cheaters and can't play the game enjoyably. For reference, the top killer on our team had 11 kills, while cheaters on the other team had 50 kills and 1 DEATH? Also as a reflection of the series in general, Battlefield 2042 is dead. I can't queue breakthrough lobbies without 80% of the players being AI, Battlefield 1 has a worse cheater problem than Battlefield V and there are less players too. Wait for Battlefield 2025, I hope Dice can redeem themselves then.

Tldr: A good game that has been ruined by cheaters. Either I'm really unlucky or every lobby I get into has someone blatantly cheating."
"trash EA service, wont even let me start the damn game without killing 5 processes in task manager, then navigating to an obscure folder location and run their horrid excuse of a game launcher. games fun, but ea should pay for making it unaccessible/damn near unplayable"
For a triple A game is so bug/y and broken...
"Worst battlefield campaign by far

Shit writing"
wtf it was a good game until god fucking EA banned the anti-cheating robot.
I enjoyed the Bad Company(s) but this one just feels like another generic AAA game.
"I have had 806 hours on this game, and I can assure you nearly 25% of that was me running into problems launching the game and running into servers full of cheaters and hackers literally shutting the servers down as they wish.
They have absolutely shattered their reputation and still do not do anything about the many cheaters destroying our gaming experience everyday. I would rather pay for drugs than any other game made by EA, it is a mistake I'll gladly not repeat."
worst
"this game is causing the PC to crash or freeze - no help from EA whatsoever - no, I do not recommend this to anyone."
My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on battlefield V and it gets 150 likes and 50 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer and some vodka So im just gonna leave this here.
There's no more servers for me.
game kinda cheeks ngl.
"nope, got cheater every game"
"thank you ea for adding this broken anticheat that makes me have to go through a headache to make all my ea games work (fifa 23, bfv) because its so broken it breaks them and they dont launch"
shitass game
"It’s amazing how in such a game, where so many little details are thought out, there is a terrible imbalance in the form of some weapons (type 2a, m2 carbine, zh-29, shotguns, dmr) and it’s not clear why planes were added to the game, which do not bring strong strategic variety , but they are only annoying (preventing you from leaving the respawn in the first minute after the start of the game, as well as using bombing too often).
And this is not to mention the fact that the game simply has a disgusting balance in the selection of players (there is simply none) and this problem is multiplied by the local community of experienced players who play on the same team and at the same time use imbalanced weapons, leaving no chance for beginners and average players . Because of such players, the influx of new users stops and the game dies."
"I want to like this game as a PC user.

When I play on servers where there are no cheaters, it feels like it's a game of skill. Most of the time it feels like a cruel respawn simulator even after over a hundred hours of playtime

Unfortunately, the few American servers available are basically impenetrable to new players thanks to the pervasiveness of hacking. 

The hackers have completely ruined the experience.

It has gotten noticeably more rotten since the recent supposed anti-cheat update.

I often will play with higher ping on Japanese servers just to experience less exploited rounds of play, and as a reality check when players appear to be more lucky than skilled when spectating."
Just don't buy EA games...
bf1 best
Multiplayer does not work. Impossible to connect.
This game too many cheater and internet problem
"EA is adding their invasive kernel level anti-cheat to Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042 which breaks Steam Deck/Linux support.

Kernel level anti-cheats also create a massive attack surface for security vulnerabilities for Windows users because when an exploit is eventually found in the anti-cheat, it will allow a hacker to compromise the software and gain full, unrestricted permissions to your computer's operating system.

Now some users are okay with sacrificing security and privacy for getting rid of cheaters. A major problem with this is that kernel anti-cheat isn't actually fully effective. Cheaters have already found various methods of bypassing kernel anti-cheat detection. This has already been proven possible and demonstrated on YouTube using games like Valorant. This type of anti-cheat evasion will likely never fully go away as more companies are getting into selling hardware cheats, which are often harder to detect.

Risking the security of your computer over video games is simply not worth it. Especially if you have any sensitive data stored on your system (socials, banking info, passwords, login cookies, authenticators, etc.)"
"the game is still full of hackers, the multiplayer doesnt work due to the lack of servers and players. it looks like a dying game to me specially since DICE ruined the battlefield franchise after battlefield 1"
Game still has silly bugs after years from release. Some gun skins don't unlock once you have reached or surpassed the need gun level. Tried working it out with EA support a few times with no fix.
I enjoyed 170 hours of this game until EA forced anticheat that doesn't support Linux. Now it's unplayable and a waste of money. Don't purchase if you intend to play on steam deck or other Linux OS.
"I reinstall this game once or twice a year(which is a huge waste of 90 gigs of data gotta say) and every time I return to it I'm immediately reminded of why I left in the first place. Horrible balance, stagnant community, overbearing vehicles and planes manned by absolute no-lifers. Just genuinely unfun for probably 9 out of 10 matches and a clear team-stomp with no real counter play. Maybe one game a session will be close with some fun back and forth's. Otherwise its just vehicles circling the drain capping points in a dead franchise."
dumb anti cheat for steam deck :(
Full of cronus zen and macro mouse players.
"Game crashes, unable to enter the game.

can't play the game after stup1d anti cheat update
"This isnt a good game by any means, but its better than 2042."
Good game but dead
Thanks to E(normous) A(ssholes) and their wonderful update this game is no longer playable on a steam deck.
"Wtf bro, when i play story mode my game always gets stuck on the black screen after the first cutscene. DON'T BUY THIS SH1T... F#ck you EA"
Every Great game have it cheap copy
"Really well made game and all but the playerbase turns this game into a torture device that Satan himself would vomit at the sight of it. Here are the type of people you are going to meet playing BFV (or most BF'S in the matter)

1. Snipers. These people will sit on the edge of the map, watching you, and sniping you at the most random moment. You can't do anything to them, cause they spend their miserables lives training to be fzzcking Hawkeye and ruining people's day. They will know if you try to sneak up on them, and they will pity you for trying

2. Pilots. Want to try out the planes for the first time? Well good luck trying to fend off the bloodlusted plane that is flying behind you and who can kill you in 4 fzzcking seconds because they can predict what manuevers your going to enact to try to survive. They'll even torment you on the ground. They'll come out of  nowhere and hit you with a bomb using the most precise aim they can muster up. Or maybe they'll just shoot bullets at you. Eitherway, your dead.

3. Swoopers: About to kill someone? Well kiss that dream goodbye because some random arse will show up out of nowhere and kill you just right before you can get your kill. They always show up out of nowhere. They know where you are and you can't stop them. Nothing can't stop them. As soon as you found your target, the swooper will materialize out of thin air and make sure you don't get that kill.

Medics who don't revive even though I am RIGHT THERE: If you are one of these people, kindly drink arsenic

And before I finish off this review, let me present you a phenomenon.

If you spawn in with a sniper rifle or long range weapon,you are going to fight against people who have close range weapons and will die easier. If you decide to spawn with close range weapons, 

EVERY SINGLE PERSON WILL APPARENTLY HAVE A LONG RANGE WEAPON.

 YOU CANNOT WIN, THIS GAME IS ABOUT DYING AND RESPAWNING,DYING,RESPAWNING,DYING,RESPAWNING,KILL,DYING,DYING,DYING. IF YOU ARE STILL READING THIS. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. YOU WILL BECOME THE THING YOU HATED. EVERYTIME YOU DIE YOU WILL FACE YOUR INNERMOST INSECURITIES. THEY WILL COME OUT OF YOU AND POINT EVERY SINGLE MISTAKE YOU HAVE EVER FREAKING DONE.

AND IF YOU IGNORE THESE WARNINGS, THESE HECKLINGS THAT FACE YOU. THEN ONLY YOUR FLAWS WILL BE YOUR DEFINING FEATURE. YOU WILL BECOME A FLAWED BEING.

Otherwise fun game, campaigns is decent enough.

8/10"
"It doesn't launch from Steam, the EA app, or launch in admin mode. It's a completely broken game, I've tried everything, verifying installation, moving it to my main drive, removing the overlay, uninstalling and reinstalling,  etc. Don't buy anything from EA, they were voted the worst company two years in a row for good reasons. Even though I bought this on sale for dirt-cheap a long time ago, it's still completely worthless because the entirety of my playtime has been spent trying to launch this worthless waste of hard drive space published by a fraudulent, cancerous corporation."
I can't start up the game after anti-cheat update.
"After the last anticheat there are more unbearable cheaters than before. Game is not playable in online mode anymore.
I want my money back!"
EA Rootkit BS borked this game on lunix
"The anti-cheat has arrived, No cheater clapping my cheeks from anywhere/anytime now."
"500 hours in a nutshell.
-Classes.
Classes in BF5 are represented by:
Assault. The most universal class, prepared for fights at all distances (even at long range ""thanks"" to DMRs). It has a lot of different types of explosives to kill tanks, planes and infantry.
Medic. King of close range gunfights. A highly necessary class equipped with infinite medkits and the ability to revive your teammates. Perfect pick for small maps. Also if you want to be more effective beyond 20m you can try bolt-action carbines(quaza sniper rifles for middle range encounters).
Support. You have 2 choises here. First is take light machinegun/shotgun and play as assault with less explosive firepower and throw ammo crate every 30 seconds to ressuply your teammates gadgets. Second is quite sad tbh, medium machineguns cannot fire using scope without deployed bipod so your fate is to lie on the hill where you become easy target and didnt help your teammates or hold a coridoor staying behind some box or lying on the ground.
Recon. At least game didnt lie to you. There is no Sniper class in BF5. Foes no longer appear on a minimap during gunfights. So it is your job to spot them for your team using recon gadgets. Long range sniping is not a reliable option due to the slide mechanic, optical glare, killcam and even if you do land a bodyshot soilders often have medkit in a pocket and you have to unscope between shots to load a new round into a chamber, losing visual contact with your enemy for a short time. As a result, you must close the distance and face enemies with DMRs and automatic weapons.
-Combat roles.
Little things that can noticeably improve some abilities of a class. Choose wisely.
-Squad.
 When you play with dedicated group of people game become much more interesting and funnier. You can revive members of your squad no matter what class you play (Medic does it quickly). Squad leaders have abbility to call airstrike, missile with huge kill radius, vehicles and supplyes to help your team or squad  win the games.
-Currency and unlocking system
Battlefield V has a huge variety of skins for soldiers, weapons and vehicles. Some of them are behind a paywall. But you can get a lot of cosmetics for free currency called Company Coins. You get these coins for daily tasks, new ranks e.t.c. Exactly these Company Coins you should spend to upgrade your weapons and vehicles (more detailed in guns and vehicles section). You start with stock guns, tanks, planes and in 90% of the time you will face enemies with upgraded ones. Obvious disadvantage for new players.
-Guns.
Huge varioty for different playstyles and situations. They are very detailed and sound amazing. Each weapon has its own progression system called specialization. Playing with a particular weapon will allow you to upgrade it 4 times, one upgrade per level, using Company Coins. Basically, there are two branches of specialization, one focused on long-range firefights and precision shooting and the other for close combat and shooting from the hip. You can switch from one branch to the other only in designated levels. If you miss this place, you can change the branch only by upgrading the weapon to the end. This means that you will have to play in uncomfortable conditions and suffer for your ""ignorance"" and only then do everything properly. Idiocy. Another problem is again the gamebalance. Most of the playerbase didnt realize/care they play witn extremly overpowered weapons. For example ZH-29 makes all sniper rifles useless on Recon, all Assault semi-automatic rifles dominate everything except a high TTK SMGs at close range. Shotguns simply spit in the face of ballance. Named just a couple. 
-Wehicles.
Vehicles just like guns have specialization and we have the same problem, if you chose wrong bench of specialization you stuck with it untill you compliete it to the end. Problem here is even worse because you are not always playing on tanks or planes, and some spec-s change the gameplay drastically. Planes in this game are ridiculous. Pilots with at least 2 barin cells will go on 70-0 killstreaks, and if you want to stop air domination reliably, you will be stuck on a stationary AA platform or you can steal a possible normal and more universal tank slot just to use mobile AA wich only good against planes and because of that you lose your game potential. Tanks sitting on the edge of the map will not help your team advance and will ruin the game for the opposing team.
-Test range.
Has the most basic functionality, all the good stuff from the polygon in BF4 is not added. It is suitable only for initial game setup and performance/graphics tests. A full arsenal of weapons is available on the range, but without the ability to test different specializations. Idiotic decision.
-Maps.
They all look fantastic, you can walk around and find some new details erery match. Gameplay wise most of them are ok, some are great, and some push the toxicity of this game community to its limits.
-Community.
Because of its casual nature, newcomers will be playing with and against experienced players, which can make games extremely frustrating, especially if you come up against a squad of good players. High ranked players will destroy teams with all-rounder weapons and newbies will try to catch up with op guns. For a middle of the road player this is pure hell. 
-EA.
After the recent anti-cheat implementation, the cheating problem is less acute but you will encounter cheaters a lot. EA keeps a high standard as usual: problems with entering the game, problems with connecting to a squad or a friend on the server, unfinished game, crazy bugs from time to time.
-Conclusion.
You can enjoy this game for some of its aspects or play with friends and just have fun/tryhard. It can give you roller coaster of emotions. But if you want to play it solo only because its game of Battlefield series you can safely skip this one."
NOPE
"frames suck, and if you want a good time, then you better already have a squad because randoms sit back at spawn and miss every shot...almost fun, yet still somehow better than cod in 2024...????"
"They updated it so that us, Steam Deck and Linux users can no longer play. I paid for this game, spent my time on it, even after how badly they massacred the franchise, just so that they can flip me off in the face."
Plagued by cheaters.
SHIT GAME
"i play it 10 fps
please donate better pc"
"READ THIS IF YOU PLAYED BATTLE FIELD 1 !!!
The game looks and plays great !!....but :\
edit:-
1)the game is riddled with hackers 
2)the gun progression system is extremely frustrating , as in order to unlock the full potential of a gun you need to keep grinding with it to keep unlocking its parts / perks and slightly better its performance....this mechanic sounds good when written down but when you and your enemy are in a 1v1 and you have to compensate your aim for the recoil and the enemy dont (while both having the same weapon) its quite infuriating and annoying 
3)the paciffic campaign is extremely unfair for the US as the enemy blows up almost every beach landing ships (my opinion)
4) every nation has access to the weapons of every other nation....why?... i dont know....its extremely stupid and ruins the atmosphere of the game  (this was also in bf1 yet the ww1 weaponries was completely unknown to most of the playerbase {including me} thus it went unnoticed but when you hand an garand to a natsi.....it catches ones eyes)
5) except some maps every other map looks like an artistic landscape lacking the grittiness of war which was soo well balanced in the predecessor game bf1 also almost every map has this annoying chokepoints for the defender and the attacker where the fight will go on in an alley way or in an cave entrance for several minutes with no flanking path available for both of the team and the battle is stuck in an annoying stalemate unless one of the team calls an V12 or shoves an tank in the enemy lines lol extremely annoying 
6) the lootboxes which used to open with in game currency is gone and now you can only get the skins you like with actual money or ridiculously high amount of ingame currency......extremely disappointed
7) dont get the class shortcut packs it gives you all the guns taking away all the sence of accomplishment which one would get if they got  the guns by completing the challenges (i didnt read the whole delux edition description thinking it was the game pack with only map dlcs lol)
8) the lack of behemoths  and special infantry type is also unwelcome
9) While in multiplayer matches  sudden  appearance of natsi soldiers in iwo jima and japanese soldiers in amsterdam is extremely stupid and the idea of  tacky outfits and stupid legendary charecters also ridiculous 
10) not neccessarily a huge problem but they removed the  collectible dogtags which could have been only achieved by completing varried difficult tasks or challenges which was in bf1 and unlocking them was huge fun for me 
11) Apparently this stupid fucking game also has connectivity issues
12) Also the menu UI sucks....as battlefield 1's menu  looked and felt awesome to toggle through but this felt like windows 8 
13) this fucken game also has an annoying mechanic in which, if you die you have to hold RMB to die quicker... like if you dont you will lay there with bloody hands ...longer.... i mean who asked for this ? all while your charecter groans and moans there is no alternative you have to tolerate this after EVERY DEATH !! 
 I absolutely hate this game 
14) most of the support guns are too heavy to be fired standing , you cant fire it until and unless you are prone  in other words the whole support class in this game is useless  (its an overexaggeration but actually some of the support weapons are not viable for pvp)
15) They heavily nerfed the sidearms in this game as they do max 40-50 damage if revolver and a STAGGERING 20-30 damage if regular .45. Revolver headshots does noticeable damage yet if you shoot an enemy with a pistol you would require 3-4 consecutive headshots to kill him 
edit:-
one more thing i should add .....upon getting to a certain level with a weapon (lvl 10) its mastery tasks for gold camo unlocks which are quite interesting , by interesting i meant absolutely fucking stupid ,but it provides the best config and looks awesome  so i guess its a great reward after all the grind so thumbs up for doing at least one thing right or better than your predecessor  which only added a star upon killing hundred enemies lol
edit
 another good thing about the game i must say is that, there were some gamechanging skills in bf1  which could be only unlocked upon completing some ridiculously difficult  tasks.....now thats gone bringing some pre defined skills in sub classes of the main classes which in my opinion is a great change !!
edit
they  copied the concept of war thunder a little bit with the tanks which is an automatic thumbs up for me as i love wt , the concept being the more you grind your tanks or planes the more powerful they get unlocking new modifications with every level up but it dosent make sense as one  rarely gets to play with tanks and planes as some of the players litterally wait in the deploy menu camping the tank spaawn......   but still great effort
edit
the campaign is a masterclass in story telling and i would pay good money if someday EA decides to release a skiing game 
edit
ok,just found out about the combined arms fun PVE with little story line felt great to play !!
and also found out about firestorm....... lol"
"Devs kiss my ass. I understand that this is my problem I am on Linux, but still. Surely your ""Anti-cheat"" will work, surely."
"I bought Battlefield V 2023 in October to only play on my STEAM DECK. I do NOT own a PC. EA just enabled 
Anti-Cheat and that has broken Battlefield V on the Stream Deck. 😢 I asked for a refund and steam said because I played 2 hours and more. I am not eligible. If this is what r*pe feels like, I wish it on NOBODY."
Not really good
do not buy ea games they will say you did not buy them you will lose access to them  there is no way for you to get your money back and there help service basically tells you to go fuck your self
asshole ea update my ass

My GPU usage is less than 20% on an RTX 3070. Not sure what's going on behind the scenes but it's terrible cause the game is almost unplayable. Such a shame that they haven't fixed this."

Can't even launch the game after the EAAnticheat implementation. EA please fix this
.
The game / story has no depth
Doesn't work on Steam Deck after last update 😭😢😭😢😭😢
DONT BUY DEAD GAME NO SEVERS AND THE ONES THAT R UP NOBODY MOVES BRAIN DEAD MILSIMERS
"Laughably bad, however the sniping mechanics are enjoyable. Very frustrating game"
Hackermania
"After the Anti Cheat update I cannot run the game! Ha! Good way to remove cheates, just make it so that NOBODY can **** run the **** game. Thanks EA"
trash
This game is absolutely terrible. Every minute I play i find another thing wrong. I'm not sure what they were going for but no game has ever made me want to quite mid mission solely because the game play and design details are so lazily overlooked. Also kernel level anti cheat was just implemented and id sooner lick random public doorknobs than trust ea with access to my system. I could write a book and the games problems but it would be easier to say whats not wrong which is the guns handle well and the stories aren't terrible but not great.
social credit -5
"Fuck EA, can't play on linux anymore"
the game is great the mechanics are cool but in the current state with everyone playing snipers it can just get stale and i get it so many of the guns that arent snipers just feel weird and weak i will continue playing changing my review if people change
refuses to launch
got 2 pacific matches then got a decent rotterdam and crashes absolute garbage
"Their anti cheat broke the game for me... It's not working anymore.

Edit: NOT EVEN STORY MODE WORKS!!"
All in avenger team with cheat
"Don""t waste too much times on games"
Great game and I played it a lot but EA shortly removed ability to play on Linux thanks to its own EAC implementation.
"[b]Warning[/b]: no longer works on Linux

The game itself is ok, nothing crazy in comparison with Battlefield 1.

[b][i]But[/i][/b] they added kernel-level anti-cheat on April 2024, 3.5 years after the original release, completely breaking Linux support (used to work great)."
the story was a let down wasnt much to it
arguably one of the most cinematic fps shooters ove ever played. still dogshit tho
i lag the server many cheater i recommend it but the review is no so yes but no but you know i change my mind maybe yes??? but how so it should no so i guess no and yes.
Keep getting disconnected while my wifi is perfectly fine (70mbps). Keep saying connection timeout. Shitty server.
for as long as it worked it was a BLAST but then it started to crash on startup being a clear mark of why prepietrary or something launchers should not exist.for as long as the problem with launching the game persists i will not reccoment buying this. please wait until EA finally des something. if you buy this game on steam you've basically gotten scammed by EA
no play
"Can no longer play on the steam deck because the latest update introduced anti-cheat features which do not support linux. I only wanted to play the campaign which I can no longer do on the steam deck. Was great fun up until then, but cannot recommend in its current form. If only they would make the single player content available on all platforms, I'd be fine with that, but sadly not the case"
"This game was awesome on release, today it's a shell of itself. Full of hackers and no anticheat, wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy as it is"
"honestly just play battlefield 1, this one just sorta smells"
"Game is busted on steamdeck/Linux due to anticheat. I bought this game to play on my steam deck and don't have a PC to play games on.

This should be illegal."
"Fix your dam game, lagging out hard for no reason"
DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.GAME IS FULLLLLLLL OF CHEATERS
EA Anti Cheat killed linux support of the game
Full of hacker. impossible to play. only thing that consider good is graphics
bad poly hit-box/collision
As usual EA borked it for linux and steamOS
"A good game borked by the EA anticheat. Now I can't play the game I have payed, not even in single player mode. Thanks EA!

Just pirate it, it will have no anticheat."
"It's been a bit since I played Battlefield. So a friend bought me this game to try and get me back to playing the series. But a few minutes into the game... I was kicked from a few Chinese managed servers. 

Apparently, if you live in Japan or some ""other country"" near China, they kick you. 
My friends told me that they can tell by your name and ping. 
Why do this? I don't know, my friends also told me that they just don't like Japanese people, allegedly for political reasons it seems ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Game play was fun, but with a toxic community like this aside from the apparent cheating problem, 
It's hard to recommend, especially for fellow Asian players living near China. 

But yeah, come on man, it's just a game. 
Can we just forget about real life and enjoy playing together?"
One more kernel level garbage
I'd rather drag my balls through broken glass than download this new EA Anti Cheat
need to install dogshit ea app to play
"EA borked this for all Linux users, never buy EA"
"compare to BF2042 it's not that bad and i actually have fun in this game ( using type 2a running and shooting every corner in church ), during sale hackers appears more and you should play in community server. It's worth a try ( solid 7/10)"
Does not work anymore on Nobara Linux due to anti cheat software.
"EA is adding their invasive kernel level anti-cheat to Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042 which breaks Steam Deck/Linux support.

This is a problem for a Windows as well, since its introduce a system vulnerability.

Not playable even in singleplayer..."
EAanticheat really?
Between the stuttering and it crashing it's just not worth it...  I have a rtx 4090 and a i9 14900kf and it still doesn't run great.
this would be a good game if it wasn't produced by ea and basically i've played for 16 hours and i've got three kills in those 16 hours and it's a total f****** disaster basically i might as well just bend over and take it up the ass because my opponents can magically see me i'm dead within all a second because the guns just lock onto me apparently and so yeah terrible game waste of money do not buy it unless you like being frustrated also i bought it on steam as you can see so why the hell do i need an ea program running in the background after many hours more of playing the game my opinion hasn't changed it's still a cheating piece of crap designed by ea and it's an ea game what were you expecting we expecting the review to change no it's just as bad as it is before except i can actually get some kills now and yes cheating is rampant
EA/DICE have disabled Steam Deck support entirely.
"Kernel level anti-cheat shouldn't be a thing. I'n not giving a company kernel level access to my system, to which I have no control over what they do, or if the app gets compromised. Not only that, it prevents people who play on Linux based OS's such as SteamOS or even use Linux as their main system to play. EA has been going on a downfall decline, and this just seals the deal. So, fuck you EA."
"Trash since they've neglected it. Poor server quality, exploits, racists galore, so bad"
You can no longer play this game on linux after the anticheat update; similar case for bf1 soon I expect (but hope not)
"Don't get me wrong, the game is made pretty well - in terms of visuals, audio, mechanics, interesting map settings and whatnot. Perhaps the only thing in the game itself that pisses me off is somewhat absurd collision physics - as in tanks running at full speed stopped by the first obstacle they ran into, it's not 2005 anymore, this could have been done better.

BUT.

BFV really is filled with cheaters - I'm new to BFV but after over 10 years in all kinds of shooters, simulators etc. I can tell - things are happening in each match that cannot be explained in any other way than
a) obnoxious bugs that couldn't have been overlooked for 6 or so years since the release
b) cheaters getting stuff done one way or another

And it's typically 1-3 players on each side being suspiciously successful as either aircraft pilots (50-0? this hardly if ever happens, in any combined arms game with contested airspace I'd consider 10-0 a great result) or snipers (picking off anyone who just peeked through their sights? those reflexes!) or just extremely ""lucky"" grunts who somehow shrug off dozens of hits only to 1-shot the opponent from just about any weapon, sometimes hip firing.

AND to combat this, since April I cannot play anymore, apparently EAC is there to combat Linux gamers, not cheaters.

Luckily I got my BFV copy at 80-90% sale, otherwise I would deeply regret it."
EA Anti-Linux trojan.
"Do not buy. The game does not work,"
"Due to an update with the EA Anti-Cheat, the game is now unplayable on Linux. This is a shame and I hope this will not remain the state of this otherwise great game."
"connection issues, by which you cant connecting with any server"
"""EA Anti-Cheat"" has Broken Battlefield V on Linux Indefinitely"
Wow I went into campaign to find missions that involve war gameplay and all the sht that I find is maxpayne bullsht. What are all these stealth bs and one man gameplay?
Servers Make the game unplayable 50% of the time. Good job EA!
This games only saving grace is that Battlefield 2042 saves it from being the worst battlefield game.
good gaym but meny cheeter blyat
傻逼ea 游戏做的再好 平台太垃圾也不能挽回你的负面影响.反作弊系统做出来是反人类的吧.都进不了游戏你做这个系统干鸡毛.还不如不更新继续摆烂都比你这更新的反作弊系统好.草nm傻逼EA si ma东西
They broke it. Steam deck can no longer play.
No longer works on linux.
EA broke Steam Deck support 👎👎👎
"Stopped working after recent update. EA added some cringey anti-cheat that prevents running this game on Linux and SteamDeck.

Do not buy if you don't want to support this anti-competitive behavior."
"I bought the game two years ago, have over 100 hours, and now I can't play it because I use Linux/Steam Deck and EA added their rootkit anti cheat to the game six years after release."
Now broken on Steam Deck
"Game was great, I laughed, ran, hid, and joined in the massive battles with my companions.
We were great!!

Now....... an update has rendered this game completely unusable on my Steam Deck.
Hoping for a fix, but til then, steer clear of this game. Does not launch no more. Only get a message...

""Wine not supported""

Fix the game EA."
"EA borked this game for Linux with the ""EA Anti-Cheat"" Update released yesterday (02.04.24).. at least I could make  100 GB up free space on ma hard disc. 

AGAIN: FU EA!"
"Constant issues launching the game, tried a bunch of various fixes that fixed issues I had with other games since i moved recently i had to wipe DNS, which fixed my rockstar games and made them work.  However no matter how much time I put into trying to fix BF5 to launch , it just won't waste of money i feel got. fix your game"
"Used to work on Linux, the only OS i can reasonably use these days. It does not anymore due to a new EA anticheat... Thanks for bricking this game for me EA."
"This game is another AAA scam, I've bought the game and it worked fine until they release their updates and block people from access it, so yes it does not work on Linux ""anymore"", but before they took my money it did right

They want to update the multiplayer anti cheat, great I don't really care, but don't ruing the single player, the sole reason I've bought this game in the first place. The way they done this feels like another scam because since the game worked, of course everyone will be over the refund period, now I'm stuck with a game that doesn't work anymore

Until they make single player available on Linux again, I'm keeping a negative review"
"So after years working on Linux, Electronic Arts decided to trigger a Kill Switch in this game in the form of a kernel-level anticheat/trojan for Windows which prevents the game from running in my operational system. Even if what I want is just to play the single-player campaign. I can't run it anymore and the game now mocks me saying that ""wine is not supported!"".

This is not only anti-consumer. This is very close to a criminal activity. I can't believe that's not illegal."
"It is a sad thing to have a mother without a plug-in, but we do n’t know who his father is. After all, everyone can be his father."
"Years after release, EA has made changes that break compatibility with Linux."
"fuckin anti cheat. I aint cheatin, why you stopped this game on my steamdeck?"
A boring game no different than BF1 besides timeline and weapons. Cheaters in every lobby and admins that kick you for killing them.
"LINUX/PROTON users, DO NOT BUY! I was just getting through the single player when EA decided to update with their EA Anti-Cheat and now get a ""Wine is not supported!"" pop-up.

"This game is EXTREMELY mediocre. 

The campaign mode (or ""War Stories"") is very short and poor quality. 
Since the missions are so short, there is no time for the characters to naturally develop or time to grow attached to them. The ""emotional"" moments are laughable and cringe-worthy. I enjoyed Battlefield 1's campaign so this was a huge step down from that.

Sometimes the game would glitch and my bullets wouldn't register, so some enemies wouldn't take any damage even when directly hitting them. Sometimes guns wouldn't fire at all. This glitch was infrequent but still very frustrating. 

The multiplayer is also disappointing. 
--The game doesn't have enough map variety.
--The maps are too large and not well designed. Most maps are very open so be prepared to get sniped all the time. Since the maps are so large, there is a lot of down time between fights which can get boring. The TTK is also way too fast. 
--The building and fortification mechanic is interesting, but overall it is a gimmick and adds nothing to the game. 

When I last played (a few days ago) the game was littered with hackers. In one match, a hacker kept insta-killing EVERYONE in the entire lobby- including his own team. EA recently released an update to counter these cheaters and only time will tell if it actually worked. 

The worst thing about this game is that it is ahistorical and disrespectful in its depiction of WWII.

Overall, I do not recommend this game. Buy Battlefield 1 instead. 

4/10"
You'll likely not find a lobby that doesn't have a hacker or two in it. It sucks because the game can be really fun but the anti-cheat is a joke. Hackers' obsession with ruining multiplayer experiences is something that needs to be studied.
"too many cheaters, too many glitches, too many bs ways to play. not worth it, play battlefield 4. less room for bs like this or warzone bs"
Not Playable For 2024. Hackers Everywhere... RIP Battlefield V.
No longer works on Steam Deck/Linux
"This is by far the worst battlefield i played,even bf 2042 is better than this shit,u will interact with cheaters every third match u play,guns are unbalanced,ading scopes and other shity attachments ruined ww2 vibe,maps are supper boring,if you are looking for a fun game to play,definetely avoid battlefield 5"
Piece of shit
They updated and put anticheat and now I can not play because it always shows anticheat did not install correctly. From depth of my hearth. FUCK YOU EA.
"Introduction of EA Anti-Cheat makes it unplayable on Linux. Even if I were to use Windows I would never allow a rootkit on my system (please call kernel level anticheats with their appropriate name - ROOTKIT)!
Screw you EA! Refund request was not honored. What I am supposed to do with this game now?"
"they added ea anticheat, the game doesnt run on linux anymore. i regret buying a game that i can't play anymore."
"Hey, thanks for invading my privacy with your kernel level anti cheat, and an especially big thank you for making this game unplayable on my Steam Deck. With support like this I will definitely be buying EA games in the future!"
"It's an awesome game with some great graphics and mechanics. But if you are looking to play a multiplayer games. This is not the one to go for, mainly because of cheaters. Even when DICE has updated anti cheat service, People are still traversing the whole field in a blink of eye and other sorts of cheats.
It's frustrating to see some players sucking out the fun for everyone from such a great game."
"they recently added kernel level anti-cheat, removing wine support with it altogether"
"Thanks for breaking the game on Linux. What a bunch of clowns, and there are still cheaters in the game more than before."
Kernel level anticheat broke this on my linux machine!
nah.
game for cheaters
"This game is clumsy. It is like a stealth, shoot, walk, hide.  Very little excitement or new concepts."
"the dev let the cheaters playing around, can't kick and report, what a crap game"
.
game full of chinese hackers - avoid
"If you are looking for a great single player game, this is not it.  Just another online multiplayer"
"it's a disgrace to history, it's inaccurate in many ways, I couldn't bring myself to even play the singleplayer because of how boring it was. 
There are certain things which just look goofy especially when it comes to customisation.
Shooting from a tank feels more like throwing a ball rather then firing from a cannon.

If you're looking FPS WW2 game go play something else."
forced anti aliasing 🤢
Battlefield 1 but with stupid cosmetics and oversized maps
