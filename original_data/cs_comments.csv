"CS2 is a war crime .A butchered, brain-dead corpses  of csgo, running like a dead animal on fire. They didn't ruin this game they dug grave and butchered the body like mexican cartel"
VAC LIVE 3.0 is amazing
ghg
i don't
The only thing VAC does is kick you out of a match for no reason whilst cheaters roam free.
"Shit game i always get non stop crashes ,"
-
its hard for new players but if you are experienced in csgo by means like csgo 1.6 or fn then its a good game for you but not for me
"too many cheaters , waste of time."
if you like being cheated on then i recommend this game
Cheater Infested.
Valve the biggest company can't get a good anticheat.
STUPID SHIT IDIOT MORON WTF

"THE GAME IS BAD its fun but its full of hackers,griefing,and mean players.They kick u without a reason so in 5 games u get kicked out of 3 . and the game needs beter anticheat, the player are so agressive they call u bad words"
"I’ve played this game for over 20 years, since version 1.3 when I was a kid, and it’s been a huge part of my life. But I’m not going to touch it until you fix the problem with cheaters. The game is unplayable right now. It’s heartbreaking to see something I’ve loved for so long ruined by an infestation of cheaters, all because the developers have neglected the anti-cheat system. What’s the point of playing when 6 out of 10 matches on official servers are a cheatfest? Fix it, or you’re throwing away the loyalty of players like me. Besides, where are the game modes from CS:GO we loved? Flying Scoutsman? Demolition? Danger Zone? This review stays negative until at least the anti-cheat is fixed for real."
trash match making
"Who the fuck on the dev team decided ""oh we should make the game easier and more accessible so we can steal valorant faggots""???????? Why the fuck is running headshots so fucking consistent? I and no other player should be able to hold A or D and just get headshots for free? If you want to make a shit game at least give me CSGO back. I'd rather play a lower tick rate older engine CS over some shit that tries to be easier. Like the hearing circle from valorant? Get that shit the fuck out of here lol. Anyways, give me back CSGO and revert the inspect animation update, that shit ugly af."
"This is a though one.
The gameplay is a depature from CS:GO in minor ways, that makes a major difference. The way your pc opperates with the server, and through to the other clients, is different from CS:GO. It has given a lot of advantage to the T-side. Combined with the MR-12 format the balance of CS2 feels off. 
But that is not why I would not recommend the game, as it is just the flavour of gameplay.

I DO NOT recommend this game because of instability issues. What is causing this i do not know. The game crashes to often. Not in every game or every time you connect to a server, but too many times to be calles stable. It destroys the integrity of premier and ranked, as every fourth-fifth match will have someone dropping out due to stability issues.
As soon as this gets better, i would recommend the game.

The cheating problem is not that bad in my experience, but it might fluctuate."
"i got brainrot from it, thanks."
No danger zone - no fun - i can shoot through the big smelly willy pete with lighting now - but pete is still smelly
this game sucks
no
this game will ruin your life
its not that good
"Very unstable game, constant crashes make it almost unplayable. Game patches often but they don't seem to test their patches, they often make stability worse. When it does work, the game is completely spoiled by the insane amount of cheaters. It's a rare and lucky thing if you manage to have a game where nobody is cheating. This could be a great game if they just tested their patches, stopped introducing new game-breaking bugs, and got a handle on the bloody cheaters."
"This game is still full of cheaters, gambling, and scammers. With as much money this brings valve, they should do better."
you will think hacks as obvious as shooting everyone through smoke and walls on the head will be an insta-ban. nope. everything's fine. give him an mvp.
so many cheaters  *_*

Valve fix your damn game and get rid of the cheaters
Its good but it has a lot of cheaters :(
one of the worst games ever made
"Good going, killed a historic game for something more greedy and less evolved than the competition"
Valve is virtue signaling by blocking ads in video games but will allow children to gamble.
cs2 was the worst update in gaming history
"Net jitter makes this game unplayable. Not it's not my router, no its not my configuration, its only this game specifically at peek hours."
i haatte it suck my toes

"Its a good game. Anti cheat doesnt work so youll have to deal with half your lobbies being cheaters whether it be walling, aimbot and spinbot if you are generally looking to do anything competitive on this you might as well play it on faceit. but they also suck ass and are rude if theres any issues. valve will never fix the cheating issue so youll just have to live with it"

"Quite possibly the most cancerous game I have ever played so bad infact that I would rather circumsize myself with a rusty bonesaw than play a single match of premier.

(gambling was fun tho)"
this game isnt very accurate guns no shoot right
Cheaters.. cheaters everywhere
"TL;DR: The ranking and matchmaking is still fundamentally broken. If you want a fair sport-like experience, official matchmaking is a horrible option.

I never make reviews like this, but this game had the straw it took to break the camels back.
I have recently been playing quite a lot of competitive Dust II with my friend who is about silver 5 (silver elite) in skill, and I'm just as good as him, if not maybe just a bit worse, being at silver 4*.

However, my actual rank the game tells me is silver 2. And the lower bracket of it from what I've seen in matches.
So to clear up the discreptancy - as the confused matchmaking would give me and my friend bad teammates - I have to play solo rounds.
Not only do I not really want to do this, because I play this game to spend time with my friend, but I constantly get matches where either: 
My teammates try yet still aren't of much help so I carry the whole game at best, 
or I get someone who's purposefully trolling at worst.

I have played six unwanted rounds in these efforts.
My final rank?
[spoiler][b]SILVER 1[/b][/spoiler]
I literally got demoted because I had one bad round with a guy who trolled with his friend the whole game.
After all of these rounds, where I'd be top of the leaderboard by a landslide every time, I got promoted in none of them.

I have spent money on this game, I have Prime. This is what I get for it?
Finally, I know what premier is of course. But I'm not interested in having to learn other maps. I just want to play the one map I like and thats that. 

*In matches where players were silver 4 and above, I'd always put up a good fight and be able to do my part for the team, so I'd say I qualify for the skill level."
This game has tons of bugs and glitches which will make you rage quit in seconds
toxic community
"CS2 has issues with its anti-cheat system because Valve mainly relies on VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat), which operates on a delayed ban system—hackers can play for weeks or even months before getting caught. Additionally, Valve heavily depends on the Overwatch system, where players review demos and manually report cheaters, but this process is slow and inefficient.

Valve doesn’t stop hackers because banned players simply buy new accounts and skins, which generates more profit for them!"
"Counter-Strike 2 — это долгожданное продолжение культовой серии шутеров от первого лица, но, к сожалению, игра не обошлась без своих недостатков. Несмотря на множество нововведений и улучшений, есть несколько аспектов, которые существенно портят впечатление от игрового процесса.

Во-первых, проблема с читерами остается актуальной. С каждым игровым матчем игроки сталкиваются с нечестной игрой, когда противники используют запрещенные программы для получения преимущества. Это создает токсичную атмосферу, которая отталкивает новых игроков и делает игру менее привлекательной. Разработчикам необходимо срочно уделить внимание системе античита, чтобы устранить этот недуг.

Во-вторых, среди игроков можно встретить множество «прокачанных» пользователей, которые благодаря помощи других игроков поднимают свои рейтинги, не обладая достаточными навыками. Это приводит к тому, что матчмейкинг становится необъективным, и новички вынуждены соперничать с опытными игроками, которые попали в их команду по обстоятельствам, а не по своим умениям. Чувство несправедливости значительно портит удовольствие от игры.

Несмотря на свои визуальные и механические улучшения, Counter-Strike 2 сталкивается с серьезными проблемами, связанными с читерами и неуместными игроками. Если разработчики смогут справиться с этими недостатками, игра сможет заново завоевать доверие и любовь фанатов. Пока же, как и во многих других играх, нужна значительная работа по улучшению баланса и безопасности игрового процесса."

"game itself is fine by now mostly, needs a lil tweeking here and there, but overall it's playable. not so much for any ranked mode, simply due to the players. ""understanding at least the basics of XXXX comes BEFORE competing in XXXX""sadly is faaaaaar beyond the mental capabilties of most players, even tho it should be basic common sense. u wanna see how brainrotten mankind has become? have a look into any ranked mode."
"Why this game sucks, if you want to play competetive normal, then you will have a lot of shit games where you can't leave, like teamate leaves, you can't vote surrender and if you leave there is a cooldown, so I can't play, if there is a cheater, you can't leave, because cooldown, so you can't play normal. Shit game, played 4 games and one  was where nobody was cheating and nobody left, but had to play all of them if I wanted to play, last one I quit as well it was 3 vs 5 and now and 30min cooldown, Valve you are stupid with this."
CS2
"CS2 was supposed to be an upgrade, but it feels more like a downgrade. Clunky movement, weird hit reg, and a ton of missing features from CS:GO. The game just doesn’t have the same feel anymore. Hopefully, they fix it, but right now, it’s a disappointment."

The game is full of cheats. 80% of players use cheats. The game is so full of cheats that it is unplayable and the developers don't even care. The developers turn a blind eye to cheating. This game is definitely not worth spending money and time on. A complete waste of time.
"whatever you do, i dont recommend touching this game. csgo/csgo2 whatever, is easily worst games in the world. maybe takes the first title on these. i have 14minutes on this game, only because i wanted do challenge to play this game 1 hour, or atleast 30mins. but i survived 14mins, and then i had to delete this game. before i vomited all over my keyboard. just... dont play this... no one does.. and there is reason why."

"**Title: A Frustrating Experience – Not What It Used to Be**

**Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)**

Counter-Strike has long been a staple in competitive FPS games, but after years of playing, I’m starting to feel that it’s not the same game I used to enjoy. While the core gameplay still holds up to some extent, the overall experience has become increasingly frustrating and toxic, especially with the lack of meaningful changes to address long-standing issues.

First off, the matchmaking system is a mess. The game constantly pairs you with players who either have little to no experience or are overly aggressive, ruining the enjoyment for anyone trying to play at a more casual level. It feels like a constant grind to rank up or even have a fair match, and that’s if you can actually get into a game without encountering connection issues or endless waiting times.

The community is another major downside. While there are still great players out there, the overall toxicity in the game is overwhelming. From constant trolling and team-killing to just flat-out aggressive behavior, it makes playing the game feel more like a chore than fun. The lack of effective moderation and reporting systems only exacerbates the problem.

In terms of gameplay, it’s hard to ignore how dated some of the mechanics feel. The shooting feels clunky and punishing, and while that’s part of the “hardcore” appeal for some, it can feel frustratingly unforgiving. The maps are tired, and while there are occasional updates, it doesn’t feel like the game has progressed enough in recent years to justify the hype. I’m also disappointed by the lack of innovation compared to other FPS titles in the market.

Graphics and audio are functional but feel lackluster. Compared to modern shooters, CS:GO doesn’t stand out in terms of visual design or sound, and the constant updates seem more focused on skins and cosmetics than actual gameplay improvements.

Ultimately, Counter-Strike has lost its appeal for me. While the competitive nature is still there, the combination of frustrating matchmaking, a toxic community, and a game that feels stuck in the past makes it hard to recommend. I’ve moved on to other FPS games that offer a more balanced and enjoyable experience. It’s a classic, but it’s definitely showing its age in a way that’s hard to ignore."

"Holy f*ck I am losing my sh*t over the case farming bots in deathmatch. Like, you can't even topscore and be in first place because as soon as you peek you get insta headshotted. Valve f*cking do something, these bots pisses me off. Can't have a warmup in deathmatch anymore, have to go onto a workshop map instead. I don't know anything about how you should run a company but thinking that this is the state of deathmatch on a *official* server is ridiculous. Like, it shouldn't be that be difficult to hire people who can develop a proper cheat detection system. And valve being valve, they have more than enough resources to hire people. Just, use your money to hire anti-cheat experts holy f*ck. A game with one of the most largest esports scene, and the company seems to be either greedy or lazy. I don't care what the valve glazers say on how we should be grateful we got this update, NO. Criticism from the community is feedback a company can use to improve the game towards what the community wants to see and change. Bringing gratitude to the argument doesn't justify any irresponsibility from the damn company."
fix .game lesss cheats
this game is very bad also it is so much lagging in my i5 processor pc i dont recomend it to anyone
if you want to play against cheaters and smurfs every game get cs2. if you want an actual game that bans cheaters and smurfs regularly get r6. csgo had its fair share of issues but this revamp is unbearable in comparison... sad to see a classic slaughtered and hung up to dry...
"BROKEN GAME...


I have never seen a game that has such a high rate of exploiters and plain cheaters. 4 games in a row, cheaters. Lost hours of time trying to find ways to beat cheaters and beat the constant bugs that are showing up. The dev team does nothing to fix the bugs either. Not even worth playing anymore. Anarchy RUST servers have less cheaters than this sh*te. DO NOT PLAY.

Not only this, but Valve makes no effort at all to upgrade / update their anti-cheat. So not only do you get skull-r*ped by a cheater... they get away with it. Worst experience of my life. If you need proof, just go to the massively popular CS cheater community on reddit. You'll find all the proof there. Over 30k people in it. Cheating. Sharing cheats. Top 4% community. Nothing gets done. 

This message is for VALVE:

but sometimes when i play, some cunts who's already spent thousands of hours of their time playing this shitty probably on their 30s living in their mommy basement have more game experience still have the audacity to call me shit player and mocking then game vote kick me.
normally i play fast pace shooter game not just slow pace hip-fire simulator where the second shot of every gun is highly innaccurate."
this game sucks sum ass
"a game when you enter to play and got 99% cheaters with wh , cuz in 2025 you got vac banned for bunnyhop not for aim/wh . doesn`t deserve purchased this fuucking game, maybe use that money to buy food for you`re children. CSGO was better in 2017 . useless community."

"ADAPTIVE TICK RATE SUCKS, OPE, NET JITTER"
"I'm wondering how there are so many cheaters in this game and no anti-cheat in the game. It's funny how Valve's anti-cheat doesn't care about reporting.
These game developers just sat in their own damn chairs and didn't care about the players."
game fucking sucks

NO
not having a working anticheat in 2025 is bonkers!
Only ppl named Sean likes this game
"Wonderful game. But the community is hell, 5 matches and 3 have cheaters, and valve do nothing about it."
"Biggest shit game in the history of cs. They have basically turned the game to a cheaters paradise. No anti cheat, not possible to kick solo players (aka solo cheaters) and a developer who only care about making money in the form of cases and keys."

Game doesn't let me drop my knife so I can have completely empty hands. Would not recommend based on solely that criteria.
No invisible woman in this game
"I havent played this since its become cs2 yet however i find it absurd that yet again theyve changed a game and made it free to play while some of us spent  money to buy it when it was still csgo, they did this with tf2 also  and now for some reason its 46gb which no valve game ever was which is what made the games even better since you could dl them in a few min anytime you felt the need i feel betrayed, shitty move valve"
I love and hate this game at the same time
Mental problems

too many cheaters
too much indians / pakistani banning them would make people proud they often troll and speak cow languagee
i feel like people that play counter strike only play other games as a break between counter strike games.
"CS2 is so messed up. Cheaters are everywhere, making It nearly impossible to play without Prime Status and even with Prime, It's still awful. The Anti-Cheat is useless, shots don’t register properly, and the game is full of bugs. It feels more like an unfinished beta than a real sequel to CS:GO. If Valve doesn’t step up and fix this, more legit players will quit. I think everyone would love if Valve brought back official CS:GO servers for those who want to play there or at least kept CS:GO available until CS2 is truly ready. That's my opinion but I think a lot of players would say the same. I love Counter-Strike by the way..."

Takes to long to get 1000 hours
"Barebones and rushed. You have to wonder why Valve felt the need to force this out the door while desecrating CSGO's legacy. Over a year since release and still has far less content than CSGO had. All that being said it still is far better than Valorant, but that was already true with CSGO."
horrible community
"Playing this game only gives you headaches. The developers of this game are either blind or too busy playing with their balls.

"The morons at VALVE are not intelligent enough to make an anti-cheat system to catch and ban all of the cheaters in the game at every level, premier, match making or casual. Their programmers are probably some low paid illegal immigrants that have about 12 hours of programming experience total."
"When I play a game and try to change the resolution, it disconnects me. After that, I get stuck on a loading screen showing 0%, and I can’t reconnect until I assume the match is over. By the time I finally get back in, I’ve already received a cooldown penalty in CS, which I don’t think is fair—for me or my team—just because I changed my resolution."
"Hakers, griefers, depression"
best game ever!...if you are a cheater
Game is full of cheaters.
Removed the only anti-cheat the game had semi working (overwatch) and then lied to the community about adding it back. This game is infested with cheaters its been the biggest problem the game faces since launch yet valve refuse to address the fact that the current dogshit anti-cheat is completely inadequate to deal with the current cheating scene. Stop supporting this dogshit game and company they took every good feature csgo had removed it and called it a new game.
Too many russians

very gay game
cs2 is ff'ed up. laggy as f and community servers are way too difficult to reach (surf)
Get the case and go play good games.
full of cheaters
"Bad game. Shooting feels of, lot of shots is not registered 
correctly. Movement bad. Matchmaking still lacks lot of things and is not enjoyable, premier does not make that all better. Lot of cheaters, i reported lot of very true cheaters and still no one is banned. Toxic playerbase, not of course all players, but i have guys playing who is griefing every third match even if i play good and say no bad words to other people. If you are playing alone, this game brings only dissapointment. Developers cleary supports war (you know which one...) in indirect ways which are kinda legal, but shady..... or ignore fact that lot of people bring that to the game and are toxic with that to other players, especially suffering are persons who has been affected by war. CS GO was bad, but cs2 upgrade doesn't make game better at all."
shitty game shitty anti cheat csgo better
Its a good game but has hackers and you end up gambling. DO NOT GET this shit.

vac isnt working
"1.-Get Stuck in a wingman with a wallhack cheater (he has fresh account of course) that just wallbangs with Negev and AWP
2.-You cant surrender the game with your bro (game dosent't let you for no fucking reason) so you can jump in another match and actually have fun
3.-Try to constantly kill yourself to actually finish that match and finally jump in a game where you dont die 5sec after spawning.
4.-Get banned for two hours for trying to end the game early
5.-Now after the pain of being stuck in the most frustrating game, you can't play a normal and fair one cuz Valve fucked you in the ass with spiked strapon
6.-Cheater wins and probably laughs his ass off in front of his screen from me being banned"
Freezing. Made me lose a lot of rank because game crashed several times and I was not able to reenter the games.

"Worst version of CS. valve developers can't make good games. Cs:go wasn't made by valve(it was founded by another company). CS:S was downgrade compare to cs 1.6. Cheaters everywhere, farming bots, radarhackers and matchfixers in a pro scene, bad network, horrible sub-tick, bad optimization, toxic low iq community, skin slots without age restriction. VAC doesn't exist at this point. I would rather play CS Classic and it will be better than this clown-fiesta."
fix your game valve
"I love the game and CS in general but i just cannot in good faith give this a positive review until a few basic criteria are met.

A working anti-cheat

128 tick over sub-tick

more maps and game modes 

after we get these thing this will probably be the best shooter on the market but until then its alright at best."

"I love this game. I've been playing it on and off since it's first release as CS:GO and it was my go to online fps with friends. Sadly it is impossible for me to recommend this game in this state because it's riddled with cheaters, griefers, open racism and harrasment and so on... If you are willing to play this game you need to be ready for not just a cheater or multiple cheaters in enemy team and also in your team... most of the time the chat (both text and voice) will be filled with racist, sexist slurs (some will just send swatikas in the chat here and there, no context). You also won't get any feedback on your reports so there is no way of knowing if the person is banned or not (or if their account was even reviewed). There are many known cheater accounts (you can find some on Youtube and then double check their account on steam) that are still unbanned and enjoying CS:2 with the rest of us. The game needs some strict regulation and an anti-cheat. Get your shit together..."

"The cancer that kills Valve from the inside
Everything for the skin casinos, soft NFTs of random value generators, don't touch the server browser your games desparately need updating, surf maps killed, casual now 5v5 so what is the point? Everything must be esports or fit the mold, no more fun allowed.
The smallest freebie they could give to the community is just let private matchmaking give XP for those skin drops, for steam groups (oh you remember those do you Valve?). The fact they don't is entirely to try and curb bot farms I imagine, just to keep the skin market from crashing. Pathetic.
We could have had the days of janky func_vehicle map mechanics. We  could have fun maps intended for 10v10 clusterfucks throwing grenades and pushing chokes Valve could have made money solely from armory passes and the gameplay could entirely be ours."
"[h1]Don't waist your time[/h1]

[h3]Actual gameplay is not bad[/h3]
And is pretty fun, at least for such casual player as I am. I've been playing CS actively since GO, but also played 1.6 and Source.

- As far as content goes, I want to see more old maps, specifically Business Center or however it was called from CSGO.
- It also wasn't fun to loose all the achievements after GO and don't have anything in return besides the single stub.
- Bots are stupid. Like much more stupid than was in Source. And there is no real way to configure them. I believe there was an option in CSGO, which doesn't works now.
- There is also no more way to pick a specific map in casual, only groups, which is a bit annoying.
- Other than that, the game can be addictive, which is worth to notice if you can have issue with that.

[h3]However, in the last years the game becomes more and more unplayable[/h3]
- It starts with [b]random VAC timeouts[/b] in the middle of an interesting match, which will immediately kick you out and not let to join a new one until something is done. I've had those almost daily recently. This specific issue requires reinstall of the game (whole 50Gb with my poor Internet connection) and reboot of my PC. There is no way to affect that other to have a better connection to lose less time when (not if) that happens.
- Then, there are [b]cheaters[/b]. Like quite a lot, but not very often. But yeah, VAC and the stupid timeout issue won't stop them.
- After some recent updates I also have [b]random complete freezes[/b] almost every match after a while. My PC isn't total crap, I play on minimal graphics, I have perfect connection at the time it happens and I also don't see not even a bit of spike in RAM or CPU usage. Also, this is the only game where it happens and it's constant enshitification over the last years made me almost sure that the game itself is the issue."
too many cheaters smh valve fix game
This shit ass game made me realise that I hate multiplayer fps games. Yes I'm VAC banned. And yes I also suck at this game.

Someone appears around a corner and as soon as I see them I am dead. There are obviously good players but you can see some with high kill ratios and they can actually miss the shot and they still get a kill. 



I have tried everything to change this. autoexec, played with settings and FPS. Nothing makes any difference.  

Then the game is littered with cheats and it looks uncontrolled. 

I had 50 hours of utter frustration and will now uninstall."

"Way too many cheaters and bug on this game.
Playing cs since 1.5 and I've never seen so many cheaters on this game. 
Since cs2 premiere mode is full of cheaters. No obvious spinbot.
Just 90% of my oponnent have between 5 and 40 friends. Move like beginner. 
Do dumbs moves and don't know the basics but hit a lot of hs and know where we go.
Look like playing in 5 vs 8... They are 4 players everywhere.

One thing: when I play with friends(so no cheat with me) we hardly win.
When I play with random I win 80% of my game.
I have a guess: CSGO had 10% cheaters. Look like cs2 have more like 20/30% cheaters or more.
So if I play with 4 mates we have no cheat... Cheaters can only be in the other team. 
But if I soloQ I have 4/9 chances to have a cheater with me."

If you are a masochist with no hope in life and cant afford benadryl or some other form of drug that makes your life a nightmare, then play cs2, its the poor mans nightmare drug. I wish I could get back the money I spent on buying the license for this game, worst mistake of my life, dont try this unless you are a virgin, an idiot, or just no hope in life left but dont wanna kill yourself, instead you want to make your worthless life even worse."

"VAC doesnt work, Gaben is doing nothing to improve game :v"
"Missing all the good maps, including but not limited to:

Safehouse, Lake, Sugarcane, Rialto, Bank, Train, and Agency. 

Doesn't have Demolition mode. Pretty graphics update but is missing most of the content from CS:GO. Honestly a downgrade."

the only reason that still makes this game worthy of playing is the weekly drops and the trading besides that bot farming accounts hackers and greifers that will vote you out even if you top frag just because they can and lots of ego full people too that want to argue for no reason. besides that sometimes it is fun with friends  time to time and the mechanics  are pretty solid but if you love your sanity do yourself a favour and play something actually enjoyable but to each their own

Buggiest piece of shit game
"Still rough and with alot of issues (mostly cheaters) even though the game came out September in 2023, while removing the polished CS:GO with 80% of its content, aswell as keeping the old positive reviews of CS:GO. Pretty cringe ngl."

"CS2 is basically an eSports horror game.
i Freaking hate those guys who somehow pre-fire every corner like they have a sixth sense. At this point, the real challenge isn’t winning ,it's surviving without losing your sanity and VAC? Yeah, it's just there for decoration.
Would I recommend it? Only if you enjoy pain.

10/10 best rage simulator."
"The worst community, full of cheating etc."
The only thing I like to even do on CS2 is surfing
csgo is better.
far so many cheaters...there is no way to recommand to any friend this fake game
"Not sure how we as a community have grown so complacent as to allow Valve to make millions on a game they clearly show zero interest in maintaining? Yet here we are. Matches in premier are riddled with cheaters, most of which i have definitive proof are walling and still Valve wont even just buy anti cheats. Anything is better than VAC at this point. 

Valve made hundred of millions off of case openings alone, this doesnt factor in Armory or even the % they take off of marketplace. WE DESERVE BETTER."
fucking broken with resolution
boring stripped down carcass of something that used to be good
evil
"What a pile of shit this has become. Every game is filled with trolls, cheaters or children. There is no team play, there is no team spirit, just anger and rage. System is fucked, way to go valve."

Better players in Silver than Gold Nova 💔💔💔
not csgo
Hacking dogs everywhere. Video on Youtube showing top players in the world hacking with skins. Which means they don't fear being banned. Which means valve is doing fuck all to kerb the cheater problem. Thanks Gaben!
"This game is dead asf if you are not cheating you are not going to get far. Even pros are exhausted of this trash company and their non working antic-cheat and quiting the game for it. I've seen players cheat like there's no tomorrow and they are not getting banned and just cause I tried to keep up with my games and start winning some with the same way my opponents did, I get banned and note I didn't even cheat the way those other people did. Not even as close as them and still got banned for it. Maybe if one day they remove all hackers from this game then I'll remove my review and recommend it for others to play it. Till then, don't touch this game, it will cause you mental issues :)"

most useless developer team. you cant play a premier or competitive match without at least 2 cheaters in both teams. valve should say thank you to faceit cause that's the only platform where you can play this shit. to all the valve team. _I_

"A story of heartbreak, betrayal, and Russian voice comms 🎭

I installed CS2 with dreams of hitting Global, but instead, I hit rock bottom. 💔

🟢 I queue up on Faceit, full of hope.
🔴 1st round: my teammate spins in spawn like he's loading into The Matrix.
🔴 2nd round: our ""AWPer"" is holding B site with a P90 and zero brain activity.
🔴 3rd round: a Level 2 Faceit account headshots me through smoke while bhopping backward.

— ""Don't worry bro, it's just game sense."" 🧑‍🎓

MY BROTHER IN CHRIST, YOU'RE STREAMING WALLHACKS.

By round 5, my entire team is either griefing, AFK, or arguing in five different dialects of Russian. The only English words I hear:
👉 ""ez lose""
👉 ""go next""
👉 ""cyka cyka cyka""

Meanwhile, I'm over here in a 1v5 clutch, heart pounding, palms sweaty, holding onto the last shreds of my sanity. I line up the shot… AND SUDDENLY:

⚠️ CONNECTION LOST TO GAME SERVER ⚠️

Valve Anti-Cheat has detected that your opponent is using software assistance.

Me: Finally, justice!
Valve: The match has been canceled. You lose 25 ELO.

At this point, I uninstall the game, walk outside, touch grass, and get hit by a pollen allergy attack so severe that I respawn in my own room.

10/10 experience, would suffer again. 😭

Right now game is unplayable. Every 2 match you can encounter either a wallhack or some other funny feature player. Only way to play cs2 right now is faceit. Till valve didnt do anything about cheaters i do not recommend playing on that game.
Who needs HvH servers when you can play MM and premiere
"valve banned after 10 hours for ""cheating"" there mad im better"
too many fucking cheaters fix anti cheat yall niggers
"Getting a cooldown for 1 week because too many kicks given? we voted to kick them because they where offline you fkn idi*ots of game developers, don't you watch the game afterwards, worst game ever"
i cant recommend this game cuz is fucking trash for retarded peoples to lost the time of ur life
Didnt play for a month straight randomly went on steam to find out I was vac banned :thumbs up: amazing!

this game is not free it takes a lot of happiness off your life

"Don't buy PRIME, in case you are hoping there to be less cheaters.. Competitive is full of cheaters, ranking system is one of the worst I've ever seen, VAC doesn't work until you lose 10 games and lose rank in the process.. almost 15Eur or this piece of garbage is totally not worth it.. Stick to cs 1.6 or some other game as this is ridiculous...."
shitgame
so much cheaters vac are useless
"premier, all game cheaters..."
"Game is full of cheaters and always has been, if you want to be another delusional playing a broken game full of cheaters go ahead. Skin market is also a huge scam. One that makes little kids commit suicide. Community is asking for 10 years for 128 tick servers and a decent anticheat and even thou this game makes v0lvo 1 billion a year they don't do it. Inflated player base by bot farms, this game is dying a fast death, would be faster if not for all the artificial build up. STAY AWAY FROM THIS!!!!!!!!"
The concept of the game is great. But it has become a shit game with cheaters. I do not think the game developers can not solve the issue with cheaters while Faceit team doing it great. I think if the developers solve the problem with cheaters the large amount players stop playing it which is huge minus for Valve in terms of money and so on.
What happened to this game man
Shit game full of hackers
not enough waifus...
"Personally, I found CS:GO better than CS2. Cheaters are in almost every round, especially if you play in the upper Elo."

RENAME THIS SHIT GAME TO FUCKING CC (CHINESE AND CHEATERS BECAUSE THATS THE ONLY FAGGOTS THAT PLAY THIS SHIT)
"cheaters still up, i have reported them, and they still playing"
"This game Is trash. The Matchmaking System Is terrible and barely works, micro-transactions are awful, visually looks mediocre compared to the older games. the gun-play plays and feels half-baked, cheaters are everywhere In this game. etc; This game Is an absolute disgrace and should've been completely separate instead of replacing an already functional game? Even though I never liked Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Counter-Strike 2 Is an Terrible experience. Just play 1.6 or Source even if those two games have almost dead servers."
csgo better
"The game is full of cheaters. Every single game you will run into a cheater. vac will unban cheaters for a second chance to what?"" cheat better maybe. Who knows. 42 billion dollar skin market. $5 anti cheat"

"killed the game and served me its corpse, calling it an ‘engine upgrade’"
nothing
"Many work on the game still needed, I've been in many matches where someone leaves before 3rd round and still the whole team has to lose the same amount of prem points. No remake system at all. Cheaters also a big issue still I've seen the craziest cheaters people on nuke fully shooting through walls/roofs with ssg or revolver without any VAC thing seeing this happen when its obvious as hell. The only good thing rn about the game is the skins honestly."
"horrible people play this game, people flexing that they have cheats and hacks"
bad notvery good lost all money to cases curse steam !
dfgdfgdfgdgdd
"Cheaters, cheater cheaters.  It  should be one of the greatest fps  of all time, but it's filled with toxic players and wanna be pro.  So what do they do?  After they loose pistol round, they turn their wall and aim bots on and  3 round later have 14-1 K/d ratio.  It's great to practice reflexes, until your realise you don't stand a chance. And the game devs aren't  either banning any of them or doing anything substantial about the cheating issues. So think twice before sinking time and money into this game. If you are to play it, get a second party launcher witch will minimised your chance of encountering cheaters, but even then, you still will. besides trying to take your money, I don't think they care at all about anything else."
God this game sucks.
"This is hot garbage, but i can't stop playing it"
my game wont open now ima get ban for a mouth

game keeps crushing after few games without reason, and i need to reset pc everytime
now i cant get into game, after playing few hours it kicked me in premier mode
it will be 'my fault' that the game crushed....... 

for a game that enters tens of millions a month, you would expect something better."
"Unplayable. Very poorly optimized to lower level rigs, therefore its completely unplayable to a good chunk of people. The vastly superior league of legends and vastly smarter, more intuitive, and creative development and ownership team win out against the lowly, lazy valve. ONLY PLAY IF YOU WANT AT LEAST 100 MS AND CONSTANT JITTER."
fuck this game and fuck valve
I'm going up against people who have thousands of hours who have been playing since 2019 and sweat hard and exploit mechanics while i'm just trying to play casually. You'd think a basic matchmaking system would be on your list but I guess not
"MASSIVELY disappointed. Game keeps crashing or becoming unresponsive. I've tried everything YouTube, Google, Reddit, or the Steam Community can advise. Sucks."
No escape from gambling lil bro
"[NEW REVIEW]
You replaced CS:GO entirely with 2 instead of creating a new version and keeping the previous one as well. It's good we still got CS 1.6 to play since CS2 is not working.
At the same time you removed CS:GO without even coming up with a macOS version for CS2. No mention of dropping macOS whatsoever.
You also lied about the game ""Coming this summer"", but it was released on 28 of September. Transparency needs to improve at Volvo.

Also: Gabe Follower is the biggest clown in the CS community.

[OLD REVIEW]
Pretty good. You hate it, but you come back to it eventually."

This game is just full of cheaters. You try to rank up but then you get hit by cheaters and you fall back in ranking...
"Matchmaking in this game is the worst I have ever seen. 1/10, I don't know why anyone likes this, but my friends enjoy it somehow.
Also, I have a lot of jitter, this is the only game I have ever had network issues in the last 3 years."
booooooo
"Since it is free and full of freeloaders, 
since Russian players can't speak English, because their ego can't accept the fact that their language sucks and will never be international, 
since there is tons of cheaters who can't get banned becouse Steam loves them for playing and for buying games, 
this game turned out to be a Piece of a Shit. Trust the guy who was playing CS: 1.5 more than 20 years ago."
too many russians
More cheaters everyday.
"I know its still in development but a massive downgrade from csgo. Cheaters, sub tick exc."

"Absolutely terrible video game, issues from day 1 that remain unfixed. Avoid at all costs. Low quality money grab scheme."
"Hackers everywhere its hilarious, just get on Face it, i've never seen such a huge amount of cheaters in a game, fucking Tarkov might even have less cheaters lmao, but when you get a fair game its so different and feels pretty good."

"There are too many cheaters, and Valve can't find any solution. Why aren't hardware bans applied to players detected using cheats? A cheater has to get caught in Overwatch, receive a cheating conviction, and get their account banned. Then, they'll just buy another prime account for a few bucks and continue ruining our games. Since Valve isn't addressing this issue, every player over 30 that I've talked to believes Valve itself is the one releasing these cheats. Until Valve finds a definitive solution to cheating, all non-cheating CS2 players should boycott Valve."
you will become a gambling addict
got vac banned for no reason and they dont even tell me why i got banned and i cant even sell my fucking skins to refund my money that i spend in this shitty full of cheater fucking game 10/10 game with very good support and anti-cheat <33333 !!!!

"Counter-Strike 2: A Love Letter to Wallhacks, Spinbots, and the Glorious Chinese Gaming Renaissance

Counter-Strike. Two words that conjure memories of late nights fueled by Mountain Dew, frantic keyboard mashing, and the existential dread of being headshot by a ten-year-old with reflexes faster than a caffeinated hummingbird. And now, we have Counter-Strike 2, a shiny new coat of paint on the same addictive, frustrating, and utterly captivating formula.

But CS2 is more than just a graphical update. It's a cultural phenomenon, a social experiment, and, most importantly, a testament to the boundless creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of… certain segments of the Chinese gaming community.

Let's be honest, folks. Counter-Strike, in its purest form, is a game of skill, strategy, and lightning-fast reflexes. But for some players, particularly those hailing from the land of pandas and questionable internet cafes, the thrill of victory isn't enough. They crave domination. They yearn for supreme power. And they're willing to… explore alternative avenues to achieve their goals.

Enter the glorious world of wallhacks, aimbots, and spinbots. These aren't mere cheats, my friends. They're works of art. They're digital symphonies of destruction, composed with the precision of a neurosurgeon and the subtlety of a jackhammer.

Imagine, if you will, a quiet CS2 match on Dust II. The tension is palpable. The air is thick with anticipation. And then, out of nowhere, a figure emerges from T spawn, his crosshair locked onto your skull with the unwavering accuracy of a guided missile. He spins around like a demented ballerina, mowing down your entire team with inhuman precision.

Is this a skilled player? Perhaps a prodigy blessed with superhuman reflexes?

No, my friends. This is a Chinese gamer on a mission. He is an artist, a visionary, a master of the digital dark arts. He is… the Spinbot Samurai.

And let's not forget the Wallhack Wizards. These cunning strategists possess the uncanny ability to see through walls, anticipating your every move with the clairvoyance of a fortune teller. They know where you're hiding, what weapon you're using, and whether you had pizza for dinner last night.

How do they do it? Magic? Espionage? A secret pact with the Illuminati?

Nah. They just downloaded a free program from some shady Russian website. But hey, who are we to judge their methods? They're just embracing the technological advancements of the 21st century.

But the true genius of the Chinese cheating scene lies not in the hacks themselves, but in the sophistication of their denial. Oh, they'll vehemently deny any wrongdoing, even as they're blatantly wallbanging you through three walls with a Desert Eagle.

""No, no, I'm just very lucky!"" they'll exclaim in broken English, their voices dripping with feigned innocence. ""I have good gaming chair! And I drink much Gamer Supps!""

And if you dare to accuse them of cheating, prepare for a torrent of abuse and insults that would make a sailor blush. They'll accuse you of being a ""noob,"" a ""hater,"" and a ""racist pig."" They'll threaten to hack your computer, dox your family, and send you pictures of… well, let's just say things you wouldn't want to see before breakfast.

It's truly a sight to behold. The sheer audacity, the unwavering confidence, the unbridled rage… it's like watching a Shakespearean tragedy unfold in real time, only with more racial slurs and less iambic pentameter.

Now, some might argue that cheating is wrong. That it ruins the integrity of the game. That it's unfair to honest players who are trying to climb the ranks through hard work and dedication.

But I say, poppycock! Cheating adds a certain… je ne sais quoi to the CS2 experience. It's like a spicy chili pepper sprinkled on a bland plate of oatmeal. It injects a dose of chaos, unpredictability, and sheer, unadulterated hilarity into an otherwise predictable game.

Besides, let's be honest, trying to outsmart a cheater is a skill in itself. It's like playing chess against a computer that can see ten moves ahead. You have to think outside the box, anticipate their moves, and exploit their weaknesses. It's a mental workout that will sharpen your mind and prepare you for the challenges of the real world.

And let's not forget the economic benefits of the Chinese cheating industry. Think about it. These talented programmers are creating jobs, stimulating the economy, and providing a valuable service to gamers who are… less skilled than others. They're the unsung heroes of the digital age!

Of course, Valve, the benevolent overlords of Counter-Strike, are constantly trying to crack down on cheating. They ban thousands of accounts every day, update their anti-cheat systems, and even resort to… gasp… hiring actual human beings to monitor the game.

But the Chinese cheaters are always one step ahead. They're like cockroaches – you can spray them with pesticide, but they'll just evolve and come back strong."
"The game is awesome crap, there is no point in buying prime status, because there are not much fewer cheaters than in regular cs. In recent months the situation has become much worse. Cheaters are found in almost every game, with macros, aim settings or whatever. My advice, which will save you time, nerves and money: buy Prime only when a new anti-cheat comes out, not earlier. Or you can try it on Faceit."
add fucking overwatch and ban all cheaters not add new skins clowns
...asd

FULL OF CHEATERS
the game sucks ...........too overrated :(
Remove anubis from premier s2 then it would be better
Valve let go of this game and instead off making better game or anticheat they focused on getting richer with skins no csgo was better all the way now its just a trash game that developers dont even fix instead they release new skins to get money

"-1 star , unplayable game full of cheaters that valve won`t bother to fix."
"the most dogshit game ive seen, anticheat non existent , go spin"
sadly almost every game has a cheater.
I've been playing cs go/cs2 for 10 years. You will have cheaters in every 3 or 4-th game. Too many cheaters to enjoy competetive matchmaking. And if they can't fix it for 10 years - they will never do it. So there is no point to play this game competetive anymore.
VAC 3.0 IS AMAZING!
Full of cheaters shit game. dont waste ur time on this shit game
"🚨 Cheating Epidemic

The anti-cheat system (VAC) is completely broken. Every other game is infested with blatant cheaters — wallhacks, aimlocks, you name it. Mass reporting does nothing, and it’s painfully obvious that the system is either not working or not being monitored properly. Meanwhile, competitors like Valorant have managed to create far more effective anti-cheat systems — so why hasn’t Valve? If a free-to-play game is going to survive, anti-cheat HAS to be a priority.

🌍 Toxic Environment and Trolls

The community is more toxic than ever. Every match seems to have at least one griefer or troll ruining the experience for everyone else — and yet, no meaningful moderation exists. The vote kick system is abused constantly, and players using racial slurs or griefing matches face no real consequences. There’s no accountability, no consequences — and it shows.

🎯 Broken Matchmaking and Hit Registration

The sub-tick system has made the gameplay feel inconsistent and unreliable. You can shoot first and still die. Peeking feels like a gamble, and hit registration is frustratingly inconsistent. High ping abusers and regional matchmaking issues only make things worse.

💀 Valve — Fix Your Game

Counter-Strike is too important to the FPS world to be left in this state. The player base deserves a working anti-cheat, better matchmaking, and actual consequences for toxicity and cheating. Valve needs to take these issues seriously — otherwise, players will continue migrating to other games that actually care about the competitive experience.

Verdict: Counter-Strike 2 has the potential to be the best FPS in the world — but only if Valve decides to stop treating it like a cash cow and starts investing in fixing the core issues. Until then, it’s hard to recommend this game to anyone serious about competitive play"

"Bruh. Regardless of player skill, difficulty, or anything else, you shouldn't be able to vote people off your team.  What is this? 1980's football practice? Get with the times man, its 2025 and clearly voting people off of your own team is just cringe."
alot of hackers
"Trash, very unplayable"

"Can't even queue with friends, trash game."

"Cheating situation is so bad in this game. Out of my last 10 rounds 7 of them were full of cheaters/smurf accounts. DO NOT GIVE THIS GAME ANY OF YOUR TIME, LET ALONE YOUR MONEY"

everyones cheating games not worth playing unless get an anti cheat that works. could be a great game if they fixed cheaters that is all
"Game is great, but full of hackers. I dont remember playing a game in casual mode without a wall hacker"
anti cheat dont work pls dont install its so beyond fucked
Too many tryhards and bots
我真讨厌这个游戏
"Absolute garbage.
Even with ""prime"" you still play against people with wallhack in every second game because vac just doesn't work."
fuck this game

"Counter-Strike 2 is a good game, but the servers are so unbelievably laggy. I joined a game one time, and I was lagging so hard that it felt like I was teleport wherever I walked."
"game bad >:(
i point at da enemy an i do the shooting but my bullets are go a alll over da place :("

game doesnt get enough love from the devs + bad anti-cheat
"Minutes into a deathmatch and im greeted with multiple cheaters in the same lobby, pathetic."
"Just played 2 games and got 2 cheaters in a row. 1 game on my team and 1 game on enemyteam.
This game needs a better anticheat, there are so much more cheaters than in 2016. Unplayable.
Tell me when actual working anticheat is in the game and I will play it."
Most fragile player base in man kind
The addiction is worse than with gambling or alcohol! And the servers are full with people who run on 2 brain cells
"If you're thinking of installing this, I'll tell you something. I spent more than a thousand hours on this joke and I deeply regret it. I could have used this time for something productive if someone told me to let it go. Go do something that adds to your life, don't install this crap."
I miss when Counter-Strike was just a game a not a way for developers to make cash off gambling addicts.
"Counter strike 2, the  game where you can get the first couple shots on a guy and still die"
cheaters all time
"I know not much hours played on this game, but i can say im decent. also i don't have prime, so because of that i get soo many cheaters. it would be really good if they fixed their anti cheat, in non-prime ofc."
"You can't play this game, You can't play any game mode without a cheater in the lobby, Game is full of players with 200 hours or less and they can kill you 9/10 times even if you have 10 times more hours and that happens all the time, Cheats are available ANYWHERE and WallHack is more common than ever! Playing this game makes me wanna delete it more and more."
why
Game is currently full of blatant cheaters and valve seemingly doing nothing
"Great game, ruined by cheaters

CS2 has solid gameplay, but the cheating problem makes it almost unplayable. VAC is useless—nearly every match has blatant or closet cheaters. The rare game without them is usually a stomp, likely because the cheater is on your team instead. The only way to enjoy CS2 is on Faceit, where their anticheat actually works. Until Valve fixes this, matchmaking is a waste of time."

What was once a fun game is now full of hackers able to easily bypass the trash VAC ban system.

"I wish you would never release Deadlock, as a karma for cs2 anticheat and dota’s ranked mode plagued by boosters and throwers even at 3k MMR, and cs2 steam support’s inadequate ticket reviews and responses.
Imagine releasing new cs2 season without anticheat in prime.
Even office and italy are unplayable now. You cant get your weekly cases without pain in the ass.
Yey!"
cant get good at this game
If you wanna deal with constant cheaters ( or you wanna become one((hope you rot if you do))) its a great game! Reporting a cheater takes too long to resolve so you can be able to enjoy the game. By the time it gets sorted you've lost all will to play the game. Its an amazing game with great details and graphics. If they resolve the hacking issues its gonna be the best ever. Until then...stay away as its a waste of energy and nerves.
you play 1hr to tie most games
Infested with cheaters. On all the ranks. Valve decides to do nothing about it and ruins the game for everybody.
Gives me low trust because im smurfing on terrible cs players when im immortal 1 in valorant
garbage
CS2 is a f*cking joke
"The anti-cheat in Counter-Strike 2 is absolutely terrible. Every single match has at least one or two hackers ruining the game. It feels like the developers don’t care about maintaining a fair competitive environment. No matter how much you report, nothing changes. If you’re looking for a fair and fun FPS experience, this isn’t it. Stay away until they fix the cheating problem."
"if you like hvh, random sprays, and bad netcode, this is the game for you"

"[h1] The worst most popular video game [/h1]
This game [b]shouldn't[/b] be alive no more, we are letting this company get away with zero effort content while the servers are on fire and the ""anti-cheat"" is non-existent.
These issues have been there for years, and it just keeps getting worse.. 

Game kept alive with tournaments and the fact that everyone will lose their ""hard earned"" money if the game economy dies. Cheaters have always been there, they just moved from community servers to playing premier when it came out. Probably 9/10 matches have at least one of them, with the exploits possible nowadays, you wont be able to even tell (perfect silent, etc.).

Content wise all we have gotten past 5 years is small map changes and more ways to dry out people's wallets (Armory). 

This is just the beginning of it, i would be here writing for the next 2 years if i tried to list everything wrong with this game, if you value your mental health at all, stay away from this game and its toxic n idiotic community."

"This game has been ruined by cheaters. In every match you play, a cheater appears and destroys the fun. Reporting them is useless to the point that I see more cheaters than real players.

I do not recommend buying it, even though it used to be my favorite game."

Brain root!
I love getting RAPED by cheaters in this game
too many cheats
"I've been playing the Counter-Strike franchise since 1999 (yes, I'm soon 40 yo), and I've loved the game so much, and I've had so much fun in it. But this version of the game, is the worst I have experienced. The game mechanics is good, with the smokes and stuff. But the shooting (with subtick) is just not as good as CS:GO.

But the biggest problem is the lack of anti cheat, and the amount of cheaters in the game. Almost every single premier game has either one or multiple cheaters, and it just completely destroys the experience for the rest of us. Valve is not doing anything about it, and I would not recommend new players to play it. You're better off playing Valorant.

Would not recommend until Valve does something about the cheaters."

"Semi rage cheaters and wallhackers are not detected by Valve sercure servers.
The current trust factor system is awful, it matches you up with and against cheaters.
If you have a cheater in your team and you want to kick him at the end of the match you'll get a cooldown.
if you grief the cheater you'll get a cooldown.
if you have cheaters against you and you're afk you're getting cd for 14 days.
if you report a cheater your trust factor decreases
The report button is useless unless it's for griefing reports.
Patch notes and ""major updates"" are awful, it's like valve putting the ""Anti cheat"" at the bottom of their priority."

Up 12-7 and a random teammate goes AFK. Stays AFK for 2 rounds and CS2 gives him the bomb on 12-9. I kill him to get the bomb and insta-kicked with a 30 minute cooldown.
"Riddled with cheaters, do not bother playing until they add a anti cheat. I've been play for over 20k hours be tween this account and my main. Reached global and 20k premier elo. Its just unplayable unless you get faceit.

I shouldn't have to download a third party anticheat to be able to play your game. Fix it and restore CS or return CSGO."

e
It's just not a good game
No ducking. game sucks.
"RANT WARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Needs its own platform against cheaters, while steam refuses to acknowledge the ongoing problem and, frankly if you want to waste time. Its fun, its fine, but you'll never know if its fair or not. Terribly saddening news.

Q: can you still somewhat joke with cruel or dark sarcasm?

A: Sadly, this is about the only pillar of enjoyment left. And i get it. Its something you can come to for those things that often help relieve stress. 

However, if you're absolutely a person rooted in fair things, for fair play. This game just isn't for you, and only a few good things remain in the pc gaming world. 

Things just keep dying on us, it's time for a change. Perhaps its beyond what the hard working people at valve have come to realize that fromSoftware, is really, thee only piece of nostalgia for gamer's around the globe. 

=IT'S SO SAD IN 2025=
*Riot has failed to perma release a game to the public online* (will riot just keep making LoL champions forever?)
*Call of duty instead of remaking a Modern warfare 2* we got buy our expansion set before we get bought by Microsoft.
*And now the backbone of every FPS is now due for its own client while valve wants to do things like make its own OS. 

It was fun at times though. :']
 
edit: and to clarify they have just as bad of a problem with queue imbalance as well at times players can be dead ass in the water, near certain that someone is cheating. Numerous Reddit articles tying in the same information in the frame, its just absolutely sad."

2 - 4/5 cheaters
3 - try to kick one
4 - vote cancelled
5 - you get kicked
If Valve does not do anything about this i will not touch this game again . Either they introduce hardwired bans , meaning anyone with more than 3 banned accounts on their pc gets permanently banned from using steam on  this exact computer OR  special ban features are distributed among trusted players AKA people like me can ban an account INSTANTLY . Why even bother making a game when you cant even make it enjoyable for anyone ???

matchmaking is trash and one sided. wither you crush or get crushed.  enabling 11yr olds to gam3le.  one of the last games to encourage  this filth.  making 100mil a yr so of course they encourage kids
"CS:GO was better, should be able to revert and play the old game. Other than that, CS2 made everything about CS:GO worse not even the same engine so it is a different game, still buggy thoughhh. AND a bad Anti-Cheat, have fun playing if you don't have prime. Don't wanna play cheaters? Then it is NOT a free game. Shame Valve only care about money like every other triple A developer now."

"fix ur game weirdos. i tried to play my first game of comp and alt/tabed out to pause music. CS2 decided to not let me back in the game. i asked later and my friends said they have the same issue. i looked on reddit and found a bunch of people with the same problem. guess what, NO FIX. I didn't spend $0 on this game for it to not work. fix ur game lazy devs"
I DO NOT RECOMMEND beacuse of well knows issues such as I hit a guy 4 times and he doesnt falls he hits me once and Im dead it happens so often you just want to delete a game and never touch it again.
prime and premier matchmaking is a joke there are a lot of cheaters and vac ban doesnt work -rep and -aura for valve and cs2
dog shit
"Counter-Strike 2—oh, where do I even begin? From the moment we locked eyes on the title screen, it felt like a whirlwind romance was about to unfold. The clean, refined visuals promised a relationship built on trust and transparency, and I was more than ready to take the plunge.

The first time I held an AK-47 in this updated beauty of a game, it was like slipping my hand into a lover's—a perfect fit. The gunplay, sharp and intimate, feels like the tender brush of fingers on my cheek, reminding me that every shot must be purposeful. CS2 doesn’t just demand precision; it courts it, seducing you into a dance where every movement matters.

And oh, the maps! Revisiting Dust2 felt like coming home to an old flame, the kind you never quite got over. But Counter-Strike 2 has taken that nostalgic love and given it a glow-up—like they’ve been hitting the gym and reading poetry in their downtime. The lighting, the reflections, the subtle yet striking textures—it’s as if the game wants to say, ""I’ve changed, but I’m still yours.""

But it’s not all about looks. Underneath that polished surface lies a heart brimming with care. The revamped smoke grenades? They’re like the mystery of a first kiss—filling the air between us, blurring the lines of what’s real and imagined. The way the particles swirl and react dynamically to bullets and grenades is almost... poetic. It’s as if the game is whispering, ""Every detail, every action—you’re a part of my story.""

And let’s not forget the community. Playing with friends feels like a group date, and even the strangers I meet online—well, some of them are less charming than others. But every now and then, there’s that one teammate. The one whose voice crackles through comms, giving callouts with a calm confidence that makes your heart race. You clutch together in a 2v5, every kill a synchronized step closer to triumph. By the time the defuse timer ticks down to zero, you’re not just teammates—you’re something more.

Of course, no romance is perfect. There are the occasional lag spikes, the matchmaking hiccups, the times when the matchmaking gods seem determined to test your patience. But isn’t that the beauty of love? The imperfections make it real.

So here’s to Counter-Strike 2—a game that feels like a lover who knows all your quirks and flaws but challenges you to be better every day. Whether we’re rushing B or holding mid, I’ll always come back to you, my pixelated paramour.

Forever yours,"
cheater infested garbage
The games would be better without russians :DDD
NO fun in playing the game just filled with hackers and not an enjoyable experience if you want a similar game i would recommend Valorant
"Cheaters are ruining CS2. Despite promises of better anti-cheat, wallhacks, aimbots, and spin-bots are everywhere, even in Premier mode. The reporting system feels useless, and VAC doesn’t seem to catch them fast enough. Without a serious fix, the competitive experience is frustrating and unfair."
NEEEGGGERRR
This game does not make you a happy person. Everyone I know becomes evil after touching this game.
so many cheaters... so many!

"Well it's CS2 duhh, I only played casual mode but the game kept crashing after 30 mins(I am on Linux Mint).
I got 16GB DDR5 ram, i5 12450H and RTX 3050 6GB variant and I am not sure why it's happening so I would be leaving a negative review for now. The casual mode is quite enjoyable for me but it would be nice if the game didn't crash every 30 mins."
i dont like
:/
"Not Recommended!

1. Optimization & Bugs
The game launched with absolutely terrible optimization. Even with a powerful PC, I experienced stuttering, sudden FPS drops, and random lag. Performance issues on low and medium settings are common. In 2025, I didn’t expect to deal with such problems in a game that has existed for so long. Sure, I understand that the game is still under development, but when even navigating the main menu feels sluggish, that’s just unacceptable.

2. Graphics & Sound
The visual improvements are minimal. Yes, textures are slightly more detailed, and the lighting is better, but at its core, it’s just CS:GO with a slightly polished look, running on the Source 2 engine. If you were expecting a revolutionary upgrade, prepare for disappointment. The game world still looks like something from the early 2010s.
Weapon sounds aren’t great either. They lack realism and don’t provide the punchy, satisfying feedback that was present in CS:GO. Overall, the sound design feels outdated, especially compared to modern shooters, where audio is much more immersive and impactful.

3. Gameplay & Mechanics
Some mechanics have been tweaked, but they don’t result in meaningful improvements. Many elements that worked well in CS:GO remain unchanged and now feel outdated. Movement, shooting—everything feels like a slightly modified version of old mechanics rather than something truly innovative. This isn’t a step forward; it’s a sidestep at best.

4. Game Modes & Content
There are no significant new features in CS2. The same maps, the same modes. Incredibly little content at launch Even basic additions like fresh maps or unique modes that weren’t in CS:GO are completely missing. That’s a major disappointment.

5. Matchmaking & Server Issues
At launch, the game often fails to find a match, and when it does, the ping is sky-high. Servers perform poorly, and with so many players in the queue, waiting times can be long. After all that waiting, you often end up in a broken lobby due to connection issues. Toxic players are still a huge problem, and the anti-cheat system isn’t nearly as effective as it should be.

6. Toxicity & Anti-Cheat
The toxicity in CS2 is off the charts. I expected better from the anti-cheat system, but as of now, it still leaves much to be desired. CS2 is falling behind many modern games where anti-cheat measures are far more effective.

7. Final Verdict
CS2 is a disappointment. It’s a game that failed to live up to expectations.The severe optimization issues, outdated graphics, lackluster gameplay changes, and frustrating bugs make it hard to believe this is a finished product.I hope the developers address these problems over time, but for now, this is just CS:GO with slight Source 2 improvements—and that is nowhere near enough to call it a worthy sequel."

A lot of Russian kids in this game they are either bots or cheaters
So many cheaters and no one cares about it
"At this moment, Premier may as well be Valve's officially licensed HvH game mode. VAC is a complete utter joke. Until Valve begins to put forth more than bare minimum effort reviews should be negative. We don't need more armory passes or cases, what we need to be able to play Counter Strike without resorting to a 3rd party matchmaking platform."

terrible.
get into other games cheaters and buggy gameplay
hackers in almost every game. (casual games)
"for starters, I'm not a gamer who is into FPS. my FPS game experience is only games when I was little like CS and PB. that's also my function is only as a complement to the team, if there is someone who is better, I'll be replaced. I have no problem with that.

then about 2 or 3 years ago, my friend invited me to play valorant and quite enjoyed it. from there I thought that it would be good if I could master the fundamentals of FPS games by playing FPS games that are somewhat more difficult than valorant, and my decision fell on CS2.

of course I had a hard time adapting at first, starting from how the UI still felt foreign to some trivial problems such as the scope that was absent on some weapons. but that was still acceptable, because inevitably I finally practiced controlling recoil and aiming more focused.

the big problem arose when my friends and I were able to play competitive mode on the Dust II map. in that game there was one player with the nickname CC, he got the majority of kills in each round. I thought he was good, until something strange happened. the location where my friends and I who were TO'd by CC were far apart and could not be seen from the same angle, even worse he only used dessert eagle. I think he used a cheat or software that at least affected his game, this was even stronger when in one round I threw smoke near outside long then hid in the smoke and also behind the box. out of nowhere I got shot right in the head, and even worse one of my friends who was in shorts got shot right in the head a few seconds before me"
bad game
"Every time I play they VAC me and I don't even know how to cheat in this garbage, yet you get people who has aim bot and other hacks and keep on playing...what a rigged system. Way to go ANTI-CHEAT trash"
Been taking over by hackers.
worst game ive ever played
"Not only is there a ton of people leveling up new so called ""smurf accounts"", making it difficult for actual new players to play against opponenents with similar skills , but there is also a ton of blatantly obvious cheaters, who are sometimes even actively celebrating themselves cheating, without getting banned.
Reporting those people doesnt seem to do anything. By the time some1 might actually get banned, you've most likely encountered a dozen or more others.

So.....Getting into this game is insanely frustrating.....
Don't bother"

The points per win is all over the place, a 1000 ELO player got 414 points for a win, ive never had that many for a win.

The amount of CHEATERS in the game is at unreal level. Its zero fun because of this. Im close to quitting but will finish my armory passes off first then knock it on the head. VALVE do nothing about the cheaters and it will ultimately kill this once great game.

A crying shame. But its a cheatfest now and cheaters, the rare times they are banned get a 20hr cool down, they dont actually get banned."
Servers are unplayable u rubberband all game even with 300 Mbps upload and download and 20 ping
"worse with every update ,recoil is random and ping is strange and you tell that you remove var but i feel var in every game"
How do you manage to make this game 10x worse than go? and 20x worse than source. This game was garbage on release and remains garbage to this day. The servers don't work and lag. Never had this issue with GO or Source. If your looking to play community servers go back to source.
"Sh1tti3st farcking game that I always come back to. It's either this or dota. Both are wet trash.

"Things Valve needs to fix:

- Actually implement an Anti-Cheat instead of lying about adding one.
- Either remove or fix the sub-tick system as it is almost completely useless.
- Add better graphics setting tailored to more lower end PCs instead of higher end PCs (No one cares, most people care about frames, not ✨sHiNy wAtEr✨).
- Fix Networking errors (NET JITTER) as it sometimes renders the game unplayable. I need NASA wifi to play the game smoothly.
- Delete CS2 completely as it is terrible compared to CSGO.
- Go back to CSGO!
- and a bunch of other broken stuff that i cant be bothered writing...

either you play with hackers or bots
"So I've been playing CS since the goldsource version, you know the one on steam. Very casual player, I liked CS Assault, I like occasionally firing up the game to play with bots because there is very little else out there like this(seriously ask on any forum and people will bend their backs so far as to recommend FACTORIO as a CS like).
This game has ""competitive-game-itus"" it is so focused on chasing esports and whatnot that it's going to starve itself to death. You want bot difficulty in practice matches so you can't literally walk up and knife bots from the front? Screw you, use a console command. You want more than 5v5 in practice matches because this isn't competitive and it's offline with bots? Nah bro edit a text file. Want the full arsenal of weapons because occasionally you enjoy using say the negev or the mac10? Screw you, pick this loadout where the mac10 has to compete with the shotguns and the P90.
It's not much better if you play with people, hey those bots in practice too easy? Well we have aimbots online you can play with!
This game has just continuously stripped features out of itself to the point where the only things it has going for it is that guns feel better to shoot and the graphics are better than it was 20 years ago. Because of the competitive focus I'm pretty sure they're going to remove MORE from the game, just before this game fully dies it's going to be a lootbox simulator that has two other options, change mouse sensitivity and competitive matchmaking."
never ever play this game.

If you like to be not able to change servers so that You can at least play with players from Yemen or anywhere else NOT russia, please for the love of God, don't wait, please download this amazing art of disfigured thinking. If you like to be absolutely ignored by creators of the game, who give literally zero unbearable concern that half of all the millions of players are hacking and just wants more money, please buy even the Prime for extra cash. Developers will love that.

Why I have more than 1,500 hours on this? Cause this piece of shit is very addictive. Don't. Just don't."

shit cheaters but fun
premier matchmaking is a trash
wo much player using hack
"bad middle east servers that you will always experience packet loss in it plus premiere matches with a heck load of cheaters no matter your elo you will always play with or against at least 1 cheater.
oh, and about that VAC thing they call it anti cheat but all it does is stopping you from changing some settings in your game, so if your a cheater you dont need to be worried about such thing called VAC Anti cheat.
this game is a damn joke at this point"
"the game is full of cheaters. i wouldnt play this game if i were you. 
This game has no anti cheat or at least a good one."
full of cheaters
"The amount of cheaters in the game nowadays is out of control. You essentially can't even play anymore without there being at least 1 person blatantly hacking. This isn't some ""get good"" review either. I've been playing CS in some form or another for over 20 years now and it's just out of control. It really sucks the fun out of the game and makes it very frustrating and disheartening to even try to play a couple matches. May you all have better luck then me."

Dog shit ass game!
Game constatly crashes
just one more case
Should rename it to cheater strike 2 at this point with how many people that are rage cheating in comp and casual lately.
may lose sanity ...
you put all your time into this game just for them to falsely vac your account with all your skins because you booted up the game while running an anti virus that was detected as a cheat....
"17 k oftad ru 8 k tu 3 saat

Why are there so many hackers?
"Instead of making a new engine, maybe focus on getting an actually working anti-cheat."
"vurnete cache i agency, mishki"
Some cheaters do this system with two accounts. You don't need to know any OSINT knowledge to understand it. It's very easy to understand this system because of you can understand that cheaters aren't as smart as those who are making cheats. Also we have a general misconception. Cheaters are not hackers. Losing track your fingerprint on the Internet is as easy as finding it. But these script!diots love to show it off.

Don't let positive reviews fool you. You might think this is a free game but every match cost a piece of your soul that is torn to  pieces little by little by balalaika and sandwich maker players. Do yourself a favor by deleting and never playing again. Do not make same mistake as i do every single time i relaunch it in hopes it will get better.
i dont know mate
no
"The game is nice, but player base full of hackers. Too bad..."
If you want to play against cheaters this is the game for you. Predatory gambling towards underage community is keeping the game alive.

Shit game that noone want to quit :P
"I've played Counter-Strike: Global Offensive for about 10 years. It was a great game! I really enjoyed it and i would reccomend it to any fan of FPS games. I had a small collection of unique gun skins and enjoyed playing the game with friends or with bots.

And then the update to Counter-Strike 2. How can you call this an update? Sure, the graphics are a bit improved, and that's nice - but not nescessary. Instead, the game has doubled down on cosmetic microtransactions, adding a ton of stuff to buy and trade.

Everything else added has either made the game worse, or was simply removed.
You can't even practice offline with bots anymore because they removed the UI option to change the difficulty.

Is it still fun for people who have been playing for years? yes. Will i play it more? yes, but not as much as i did. And i certainly won't be spending anything on cosmetics - just selling off all my old inventory.

If you're a possible new player - just skip it and play something else. Or keep your eye on this until they make it good again."

"The anti-cheat system is completely ineffective. In Deathmatch mode, over half the players are just bots grinding for cases. There are countless other problems, but it seems the small indie team would rather focus on creating flashy skins and adding cosmetic charms."
this game made me mentally ill
:D
THE GAME IS NOT OPENING STEAM PLEASE FIX YOUR TRASH GAMEEEEEEEEEEEE
Add anti-cheat game is full of cheaters
The biggest issue with the game is the matchmaking. Far too many games land with heavily skewed teams. Playing with a team of 100-400hrs play time vs a team of 1000+ playtime is absolutely crap. Toss in the rampant number of wall hackers and you're in for a lame gaming experience.
The anticheat is shit the devs dont care about the players anymore.

"It's impossible to play this game on community server. It requires you to use external server browser. The on on Steam is awful so I had to find a website that has better filters. The bigger problem is that alt-tabbing freezes the game, making it impossible to return to it. I have no clue how did Valve mess this up so much. There were no issues like that 2 decades ago."

full of cheaters
"Good game, but cheaters are annoying. The worst thing is that they don't even try to hide that they use cheats. They argue about which cheat is better, right during the game... And when you call others to report a cheater, most players say that I'm a weirdo, because all use cheats and I don't...

I don't know the solution to this issue, but kernel level anti-cheat is defenitely not a good solution."
Absolute cancer of a community that will kick new players for not being good at the game

csgo was better
MANY CHEATERS
a lot of hackers
Bullshit
"I have experienced racial discrimination from players in the game more than once. CS2 has the worst gaming environment and the most chaotic player community I have ever seen. The developers have done absolutely nothing to improve the game environment, even for Premier mode. Cheaters, racists, and players who deliberately sabotage their teammates have always been the majority, severely affecting the experience of normal players. Perhaps this game is just a joke."
"cs2 surf is buggy and bad, please fix and ill like...."
"just, no"
very inconsistent game with aim with very weird recoil with alot of hackers and alot of bugs
"The game is devastating full of cheaters vac not workyng anymore?

"Got the games for several years, there were good times and bad times, now in 2025 with the update for a game that is running shit where you encounter more hackers then anything else, I got banned for installing the new update and trying to start the game 1 month without getting any support or answers, What a piece of shit game that once worked very well known as CS GO."
"This game makes me want to kill myself, after playing this game ive realised that i want to publicly execute myself infront of a loving family of 4, i hate this game from the bottom of my heart, this game makes me want to rip my hair right off of my scalp, id rather be tortured then suffer playing this game. Fuck you."
"Going to continue adding hundreds of hours, but I hate the game so much, but i love it so much. Its like an abusive partner that you just cant leave"
How are we in the lord's year 2025 and we are experiencing BLANTANT CHEATING IN COMPETITIVE MATCHMAKING. GABEN YOU MUST BE JOKING. MY FRIEND SPENDS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON KEYS. HOW CAN YOU NOT AFFORD A DECENT ANTI-CHEAT DETECTION SYSTEM????? YOU ARE LARGE AND YOU ARE A JOKE.

This game is in a sad state with cheaters.

CS:GO was better.
"before playing this game i had ambitions, money, a social life, and was fairly open minded. I now have a gambling addiction, debt, lost several friends, and have a deep hatred for Russians and black people. If you have something to lose do not play this game, the only constant in cs is ""if you have something, this game will take it"""

my teammates have a brain tumor
"The game is a shadow of its former self. On 8/10 games there will be at least on hacker either on your team or the enemies. It is a pity, because it used to be such a fun game. Nowdays, it just doesnt worth your time!"

TOO MUCH CHEATERS CUZ VALVE ONLY CARES IF U BUY SKINS. PLUS CS2 IS JUST RESKING OF CSGO THAT LAGS LIKE CRAZY

"the worst matchmaking ever, only faceit makes this game playable"
"Counter-Strike 2 was supposed to be an upgrade, but instead, it feels like a downgrade in many ways. While the graphics and lighting improvements look nice, they don’t make up for the numerous issues that plague the game.

What Went Wrong?

Terrible Hit Registration – Shots often feel inconsistent, making competitive play frustrating.
Limited Content – Many features from CS:GO are missing, including beloved game modes and maps.
Subpar Movement & Mechanics – The game feels sluggish, and the new mechanics don’t improve the gameplay.
Matchmaking is a Mess – Ranks are broken, and cheaters are rampant.
Optimization Issues – Performance is worse than CS:GO, with stutters and FPS drops even on high-end PCs.
Final Verdict:
CS2 had potential, but right now, it feels like an incomplete game with frustrating mechanics. Instead of being an improvement over CS:GO, it took several steps back. If Valve doesn’t fix these issues soon, many players will move on.

4/10 – A downgrade, not an upgrade."
bad
"It's just a simple game for simple minds, but I still play it anyway."
Keeps fucking kicking me mid game for corrupt game fucking files holy shit can you let me play the fucking game and kick the fucking cheater holy fuck like at least do the file verification fast it always take 3 fucking hours not even kidding so i get a ban and the ban also expires in the time period of me not being able to play the fucking game

They dont tell me that they like borsh or pelmenis
its an alright game but so far i cant figure how to choose my weapon in casual however deathmatch is awfull dont play is not even about skill how can u kill person that spawned infront of you or u spawning behind them is something that takes no skill its cheap kill but its valve fault almost  feels like playing uncoded game cuz people spawing all over place ive probably spawn in front of enemy not facing towards them just get killed instantly u need fix spawn location or just spawns in general because it a big problem in deathmatch

"Can't play this shit without running at least 80 fps maximum but run with 30 - 60 fps. The graphics are very forced even on the lowest settings. Judging by my gaming laptop and setting my preformance settings and fans at MAXIMUM. CS2 just acts like they're all good and shit with their ""fancy graphics"" So you're telling me I have to blow 2,200 dollars on a monitor? Wtf is this shit. Can't even play the game without one cheater or microphone spammer in each match. And yet Valve once told me to open my eyes at 1999, then open my mind at the 2000's, then telling me to open my wallet in 2025. And now Valve's slob ass wants me to devote my life savings to open a case just to get a 0.03 cent weapon skin. And don't even start with the knives. STOP CHARGING 1000 DOLLARS FOR A FUCKING BUTTERFLY KNIFE. You don't get anything good UNLESS you open your wallet. Fuck you Valve, thanks for everything."

So if your up against cheaters you simply are not allowed to play anymore."
Just don't. There are Russian idiots. They don't listen.

very bad performance the grapichs are ass
This game is fucking rigged
"first off all forcing me to play training against bots almost made me uninstall instantly. Anyway, the slightly improved graphics dont make up for 90% of community servers are ""skin"" servers where people stand around looking at their ""skins"".  News Flash: all of your ""skins"" look gross. I know your monkey brain thinks bright color fancy pattern will attract mates but... No, sorry.

The only server I could find with people playing it was a deathmatch server with 4 other players I dominated easily but they had botlike names so they were probably bots with simulated portrait/ping."
"so much cheaters, i dont recommend to buy this game."

"Game is ruined by cheaters, especially premier matchmaking. I got cheaters in enemy and in my team 10/12 games."
"sure the graphics are amazing, the physics almost real, but valve needs to be called out for grabbing our cash and still making cs a paradise for cheaters and farming bots, u need to pay attention to your casual lobby because thats where most of ur future lies, in those players who will aspire to go prime or pro, the fact that they are exploiting our emotional connect to this beautiful game makes it worse, how can these guys sleep at night without feeling accountable for this mess is baffling. it has  been two years and still they dont care enough to fiix these annoying glitches but when it comes to grabbing cash they will extend their hands  like a frog whipping out its tongue to catch a fly.  irresponsible pricks.

after i got prime, my casual gaming experience has gone to hell since m constantly thrown into these farming bots lobby every time i try to play dust, i meant why did u ask for my cell number and mails if ur verification process was such a sham, fix this mess before every one else deserts you for some other cash grab game, since theres no difference between them and ur ethics anymore,"
"Maby try to put a price on this game, 10-15 euros for example, and ban cheaters for life"
"no privacy, anything can see thru walls atp"
Russians and turks are biggest flaw of this game
"lol, no"
if they finally ban rage cheaters its good again
So many cheaters...
boner
not very fun
The amount of cheaters really make this game unbearable.
"horrible game do not install, do not get into it. first they reel you in with the cool looking skins and gameplay.  You have some fun and go on a crazy losing streak.  Next thing you know. you are getting decimated with cheaters and retards.  You get stuck at low elo and you can't escape the hell because you get put with people that react in 4-7 business day, people that dont have any sense of sound, direction or communication, or just get paired with a whole team of people who can't together manage to kill a single person on the enemy team.  At first you laugh it off and know you are new.  After that, you just get pretty angry.  Eventually after a few hundred hours you reach the breaking point, and you enter disbelief that it is possible to play a video game so poorly, and you are fucking done and you just leave matches, quit, or otherwise throw in the towel.  Your blood pressure rises and its just different levels of fury and disappointment.  But the bad part is that not long after, you get that itch again.  Either from yourself of from your party bros, you decide to hop on again, thinking about a nice juicy win streak, some nice nades, some heavenly headshots and frags.  In reality, you lose 4 matches in a row, you question your chices and sanity, and you want to end it all.  You type quit smoking in the console, and then you get called a retard meanwhile you are trapped in low elo, csgo shit hell.  Basically, this cycle of doing bad, getting angry, then just being dissapointed, and then itching to play again continues till all you can play is cs2.  Anyway even if you somehow escape the wrath, they bring you back with the itch to have to hoard and buy all of the virtual pixels and skins on the screen.  I fucking hate this game, i wish i had never played it a few years ago, and I will never ever get my time on this game back.  I am tired of retards, cheaters, and people who you could convince me are bots because they play worse than the local nursing home. 


Edit* in addition they hit you with the ""99 in 2"" shit or the teammates that sit in nonexistant angles or corners behind angles waiting to get corner peaked and mowed down, or just wait to get flanked and shredded by a fucking pp bizon or some bs.  This stuff and retards that deide to peak heavily guarded sightlines that have awps and other shit like shotguns or negevs and get shredded really put the cherry on top.

For goodness sake please valve delete this video game, thank you gaben."
Never open cases in this game. Go to a gambling site(you have better odds)
Every other update i get lag problems of crashes every time i enter a map. I have to wait for the next update to MAYBE have it fixed. I get the feeling half the time the developers have no clue what they are doing. This is not an acceptable state for an online competitive game.
easy to cheat when you can be in discord and tell your friends where everyone is on map. would be nice if you couldnt spectate enemies. It is fun when you find a non cheating lobby
since moving over to amd i get so many random crashes. went from a gtx970 to an rx6600 overall fps is high but crashes like once every 2 or 3 matches
i love CS2 it is the best game ever made i like how they make all the dogshit changes on all maps except dust 2 bc they didnt touch it all almost. I love how my shots are not registered and how game is laggy. I just love it. It is good thing you killed cs go. Why would game be good and perfect when you can make it shittier. I love cs2. best game ever. Only thing that is still good about this game is you an be racist and say and type everything you want everything else is dogshit.
Russian dogs

"Me bloquearon la cuenta y ni siquiera se por que ! Me dijieron que es por usar hack, ni que fuera tan buenooo es re injusto por qué me pagó el prime y encima me bloquean por error ? Cómo se soluciona está m..rda ?"

Sh*t ass game run around gambling and whose developers focus on sucking G4bes d*ck instead of the ever rotting cheater and fraud problem. Tier 2 cs is a JOKE
gave me depression
no
keeps crashing mid game
CSGO is Better
"this game would be 50x better if it stayed on cs:go.
back when cs:go was the main game, there were *less* hackers, more maps better hud better movement
thats just to name a few.
valve, you've fucked over a great game. a GREAT game.
counter strike in general is a great concept and its sad to see it being ruined by;
valve, thousands of cheaters, bad updates and more
cs2 was a flop. it will be a flop until the end of its life and when it dies, it wont come back
its in its last life. this game is honestly great
but that doesnt change the fact that its been fucked over by valve
bringing back cs:go and lowering the price of ""prime"" would be better to this game as a whole
noone has to spend 15$ to actually start playing cs
make it like 10 maybe? 
also bring back the atmosfere cs:go had
that dark hellish theme on nuke, on dust 
bring back OLD maps hell bring back CS:GO
cs:go was the reason why this game EXPLODED in popularity
..and its the reason why its dying now
since so many people miss cs:go they decide to quit. can't you see valve?
do something. 
bring. back. cs:go.
or maybe along side cs2 
make cs:go also active, like how source is still availble to play?
make cs:go available to play too."

BAD BAD GAME
"Two years since release and game still is still a substantially subpar experience when compared to CSGO. Movement and shooting remain awkward and unresponsive, bunny-hopping is inconsistent to the point of impossible, the physics are questionable (why do I still rubber-band when I collide with a teammate?), and no maps have been added to the competitive pool that we haven't seen before.

With regards to matchmaking, it is an unplayable experience with coin flip cheater games at 25k ELO and above, and no VAC/VACNET improvements in sight.

And the most crucial element to the CS zeitgeist, community servers, has been taken out to the proverbial woodshed by having an in-game community server browser that is objectively WORSE than what CSGO had. Furthermore, the lack of an official API has degraded the quality of custom maps and servers such as KZ and surf, gamemodes that started 20 years ago with CS 1.6 and were present in every previous game, are now dead. 

With all that said, it becomes very clear that no one at Valve cares, let alone understands what made Counter Strike great. And worst of all, you cannot even go back to CSGO and play on community PUGs there."

Sort out your AntiCheat the game is unplayable..
"Valve's matchmaking is dogshit, a waste of time. You either tryhard and get fucked or don't care and get fucked. Either way a sad sight to behold, lost vision Fortnite ahh piece of shovelware. Wasted potential at best, predatory gambling for children at worst."
"Dog water, full of cheaters, fix your game valve"
Every match has a obvious or a secret cheater. Lucky if you only get one of them and in your team.
"10 games of premier, in these games i saw 40-50 hackers."

"This was a very anticipated update to CSGO, but since it released it's been a total mess. Even after so many - almost daily - updates, it is still very broken and a mess. The guns are messed up and the AK47 is ridiculously unbalanced compared to any other gun in the game. Also the cheater problem has spiraled out of control, it is worse than it has ever been and Valve doesn't seem to give a shit about it. I love CS but this game is unplayable and unenjoyable. I miss the good old CSGO."

Hacked games. A lot of cheaters
"MOST OF THE PART I DISLIKE TO MUCH BOT FARMING . HACKER AND LIST GO ON,"
i get carried by my mate Jacob so i can sit back and enjoy the game
It is the most worst game in match making even I have prime status a lot of cheaters and afkers even when we are winning and opposite team is cheating it will cancel the match just wasting my time in losing because of reasons out of my responsibility.
Should've stayed CS:GO for a while.
FULL OF CHEATERS.

"Absolute dog shit !!!! people getting ban for griefing when they actually not , Cheaters with autoaim full rage every single game . VAC is dogshit not working . and they actually ask for money for prime skins and other bulshit . HOW DARE YOU !!!"
"Too much racism, ableism, sexism, and general toxicity in the voice and text chats of the game. In addition valve (and other devs) can't seem to reasonably manage the cheating situation in a way that allows the games to feel fair. 

To further clarify when i say fair, I mean games where the reason for defeat can be viewed from the lens of ""how well did your team play as a team"" and not extenuating factors like someone on the other was exploiting the game in some way."
my life has gotten worse since ive started playing but i bought prime its too late for me now
Is not worth it

"You know, i played 1.6 condition zero, css for like over 50000 hours playing some sort of count strike. when im telling you since early 2000's the one and worse part of this game is cheaters. Wallhackers to be more precise, like 50% of the game walls. For 20+ years they cant fix the problem. To get walls and install them is so easy that a child can do it. VAC is absolutely do nothing, Developers dont care, like before as a child i didnt pay attention and at some point wallhacked myself in CSS, because its just how everyone was. Developers DO NOT give a shyte, 20+ years cant fix this issue. To wall its simple as replacing a folder. Pathetic from valve."

trash game
CS2 aass
do NOT play this game
valve fucked up every aspect of the game
"This game is absolutely abysmal. I wish I could give it less than one star because it truly deserves nothing to it's name. It's full of racist, Zionist, homophobic people. I'd rather shove a jar of rats up my ass and unscrew the lid than play this awful game. I hope that the developers of this game take a long hard look at their life and realise what they've done. I have no words to describe my hatred and disappointment in this game. I saw one of my friends, Ashton, playing this (awful) game. He was playing a mode that I thought looked quite fun. Surf it was called, I eventually load on and discover that it is the root of all cancer and depression. Whoever plays this TERRIBLE game is a half-whit gloom moron with the mental age of a -11 year old and that isn't even fucking possible. 

I am ending this sad, melancholy and depressive review with a note to all thinking of, about to, and or installing CS2. Delete it and bleach your eyes, mouth and ears so you completely forget this horrific game exists."

lag lag lag no fix to lag czemu lag nie wiem cpu good fps in game bad czemu
wonderfull game .... sadly way to mutch cheaters wich basicly kills the fun in it.
Hope humanity will one day invent cure from disease that every cheater have
"I have spent thousands of hours on this game. Like most people I have played not only CS:GO, but also 1.5, 1.6, etc. Worst thing is, there are people who have spent 10 times the amount of hours I have, and have the same experience. I have seen better management of people banning hackers (being very careful about being caught) from people doing it FOR FREE in community servers back in the day. How is a company of this size and magnitude not able to do anything about this?

I have NEVER left a review before in my life, positive or negative. This is the first time. In both Premier and Competitive I have now, for last few days seen hackers IN ALL GAMES. That's FIVE games a day. Somebody hacking BLATANTLY in every game. I'm not talking about wallhacks, triggerbots and other things that are hard to catch. I'm talking people using Scouts, Deagles and whatever having 20 kills, all headshots, I didn't peek and I'm dead type of situation. 

The sad thing is, they've always been hackers for the past few years. My friends and I were okay playing against people wallhacking at least once in a few games, even aimhacking. How sad is that? That you're okay with having your game ruined 20-30% of the time? 

They've ruined this beyond recognition. Don't ever download this game, and if you have it, delete it and don't look back. I don't know who is to blame, is it all the devs, is it the idiot at the top making the decision and setting priorities, but pushing empty updates instead of addressing a glaring issue like HACKING is not what this community deserves.

We deserve better than this. Move away to other games that appreciate your time and money spent on them, move onto something that is not.. this. Peace."
