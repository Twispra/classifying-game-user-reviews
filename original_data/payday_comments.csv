GOOD GAME GOOD GAME
payday2 not find epic online service. i cant play the game online  at steam?
unbelievably buggy garbage
Crashing and Infinite loading galore! Yay! Seeing one of your favorite games be in such a bad state is a real bummer!
bad
crashes too much cant even finish a heist without it crashing
"It was better when it was simpler, now it needs a PhD just to name all the heists. I am also [b]not[/b] paying more than the base game price on additional content that [i]definitely[/i] doesn't take twice the effort to make the base game, otherwise you'd have a better sequel- oh wait, lol. Also practically impossible to 100% achievements unless you get [i]robbed[/i] (pun intended) and have both willing friends to help you and have a life."

"I used to enjoy this game a lot long time ago. 
Have returned after a while and now I find this game literally unplayable with the way it randomly freezes in a mid-game and kicks all your buddies.
Found no fix of this problem, there are plenty of players having the same issue though. 
Not worth bying at the moment."
"retconned playable characters, weapons, heists, etc. that you can't get anymore, horrible performance issues, game repeatedly freezes and crashes despite troubleshooting everything, i've loved this game since 2013, and it is a lot of fun, but this is not worth your time or money to try and deal with the headache of just trying to make the game function as it's supposed to"
ass
"Once upon a time I had some fun with this game.

Now, its a hopeless buggy mess that doesn't work well with current tech game computers."
Not a fan of these shady DLC practices

Crashday 2: Access Violations and Privileged Instructions
not worth the grind and hundred plus cash to get every thing
"The newer heists crash constantly, modding is a slippery slope, and build 42 completely fucked everything up.  Thanks Overkill."
bought 1 dlc and now the game wont even start :|
"This game has hard crashed my experience for the last time. My game freezes right in the middle of a heist which then forces me to hard reset my computer. I can't Alt+F4 it no matter what. Just freezes my screen. 

This has happened numerous times and have tried to uninstall, reinstall files, lower graphics settings, and took to every Reddit post I can find. And I am done with it. Not worth any money, not even on sale. Screw this game and the devs who made it.

Also, for the record, I run no mods at all and this problem still happens constantly."
not fun anymore
Lame
too much content
vr dosent work
I peronaly dislike the game. The game is good for the first  10 hours after that it becomes repetitive.
Bok gibi oyun mk. Hack&Slash oynar gibi sürü sürü adam kesiyo aq. Ne bu eski god of warlar gibi
fuck ass devs nerfed light armor dodge builds and goon crazy style to pd3 because yea that game def didnt flop
"""Disconnected"" almost every game. Shit server and shit game."
hell naw

"Playing in singleplayer makes this game easily the worst experience I've ever had in my life. Unironically, Roblox's Entry Point gives a much better stealth singleplayer experience than this game.

Menus and UI sucks. As a new player, this shit is impossible to navigate. I wasted so many skill points because the UI didn't explain how many of them a skill cost, or that clicking an already-bought skill upgrades it. I spent so much on useless things that even the easiest beginner missions feel harder than they should.

Going stealth successfully requires so many retries, I'd be tempted to say that it'd be almost better to go in guns blazing. But, going loud, either accidentally (some random civilian on the other side of the map calls the police) or by blowing shit up, makes levels a borderline unwinnable mess. 

Bots are beyond useless. They won't carry bags to the van/helicopter unless I manually escort them there like some kind of armed babysitter. This is especially a problem since they only activate when going loud, making running to the van feel like charging through No Man's Land in WWI. This is especially problematic due to the van moving even further away from its starting position when you go loud, because why the fuck not?

I'm not sure if this is a mechanic made for completing a level loud, but Day 2 missions are just an excuse to ruin my progress. They're bad. Really bad. So bad that one time, turning around, all I saw was vertical orange outlines of my bags scurrying away like a fucking swarm of ants.

I get that this game is meant to be played with four people, (and I will try playing levels multiplayer in the future), but if you're a first-timer playing solo, expect frustration.
It's a shame really, because I bought this expecting a fun, chill solo experience. Instead, I got a crash course in frustration and an AI squad that makes COD NPCs look competent."
The game kicks/freezes you mid-game. Needs to be updated!!!
"Padday 3 is better, more numbers in the name"
"Trying to get back to the game after a few years, but everything seems broken after they joined Epic Games"
"There’s a little bit of Payday 2 hidden inside all this DLC. At this point, I’m not robbing banks, I’m the one getting robbed. 10/10, most immersive robbery experience ever."
Безудержная лихая беготня с максимально аркадной стрелялкой по толпам глупых ботов. Веселья только в абсурде - по обзорам создавалось другое ощущение.
fuck this game
50/50 chance ur save data got deleted from a semi recent update so lol
This game crashes all the time
I FUCKING HATE THIS GAME AND I FUCKING HATE THE ALESSO HEIST
Was wiped and lost all my progress would not recommend

"I bought this game at launch after thoroughly enjoying the original Payday game.

It's been a constant state of disappointment for 12+ years now. Do you like stealth? too bad, the AI has been in various stages of broken since launch and almost always something will go wrong and blow your mission! Do you like not crashing every 7 minutes for a ridiculously long list of random reasons? (Seriously, check your crash log, there's so many ridiculous errors that could easily have been patched over the years) Too bad, hope you weren't playing with a friend, because now you both have to load the game back up, hope you can select the contract by waiting for it to randomly pop up (so you don't have to waste money on it again) and hope you can both make it through the mission without crashing.

I wasn't going to complain about this game given it's age, but given the absolute scam joke that Payday 3 is, this game still is fairly relevant as there aren't many other good games of this genre with co-op still. 

Don't waste your time. Don't pay money for any of the shovelware buggy trash they keep putting out."
Why is No Mercy labeled as stealth?
its bit meh
Shit game deleted my progress
"Not enough, Bing Crosby masks available. Spend your money elsewhere. Give me the whole Rat Pack two while you're at it."
They broke the game because more people were playing PD2 than PD3..
SO MUCH DLCS ITS FUN BUT ITS OVERALL A CASH GRAB.
marvel rivals  and Overwatch is better.
mid graphics and number three is better
"Game is honestly whatever, was just a mindless time sink and got worse with time"
this game is suck you need to buy the dlc to progress in your career
"90% of the ""gameplay"" is waiting. Not 'go to x location and do y' just stand around and defend a drill. Then there's the bugs from not being able to pickup pickup bags to constant crashes. I've played roblox game's better than this crap."
"One of the most godawful experiences ever in regards to stealth, and making sense in general. Starbreeze really has ruined this game. So many game breaking bugs rendering missions that took an hour no longer beatable, 80 cops at once all firing upon me and my friends, It just is pure stress and zero fun nowadays."
"Personally I wouldn't recommend this, as I can't even play with my friends went through 10+hours of fixes, still couldnt play with my friends, however that being said. I am like the only one who can't get the game to work, so if you want to play with your friends you could probably get it to work, that being said buy at your own risk."
not good
"I'd had a mask called ""The Fox"" for god knows how long, I come back to the game just to play with friends and i'm now i'm forced to make an account for ""Starbreeze Neblua"" or whatever the fuck that is, just so Listo can sell my info like he needs more fucking money. There's no reason a COSMETIC item should be stripped just because you want to force people into another service. Sony type ass move."
not enough violence
stupid game

buggy ahh game always crashingg

I wanted to play this game but it literally wont launch from steam. So I had to get it refunded. I might try it again someday but they would have to fix these files or bug causing this to happen.
SHITTY SHIT SHIT SHIT
"its fun if you can pick it up on sale, but the game basically requires dlc to be enjoyable"
Needs more expensive dlcs
this game suck i can't launch
i dislike this game greatly
Used to love this game shame what an unplayable mess it turned into.
Not worth 80gb of data storage.
"cool and amazing gameplay and story, but brain cancer to buy dlc for this game :)
the game should not have paid add-ons where there are weapons of better quality than in the base game"
The game is not good because everything is on a pay wall and low end pcs can NOT play this game it will just crash so yeah this game is BUNS.
Tried it together with a friend but we quickly decided to stop
"removed one of the best heists in the game, and are still charging exorbitant amounts of money for mediocre dlc's."
"game too big for my ssd, i will recommend if you have specs that is good however not for those who unfortunate to have poor specs"
"If you're ready to not actually play the game while having heavy desync frequently ruining your heists and spam Diamond Store 500,000,000 times because you get an enormous penalty to XP gains if you just play how you want then go ahead."
The UI in this game is unbearable and the game play is extremely confusing and no fun. I got it super cheap on a sale and I'm more upset that I can not get a refund for a couple bucks on this awful game than on any $60 game I ended up not liking.
Another game ruined by cheaters and russians. Buh
Lan game
"if youre considering this or 3, please, PLEASE just buy another game.
Starbreeze have been trying to foot their customers the bill for their terrible TWD game that you cant even buy anymore and deserve to just accept the consequences.
Rather than fix that game or stick to PAYDAY 2 they decided to chase trends and again are forcing their players to pay for their mistake vie microtransactions, more specifically in PAYDAY 3 with its live service model.
you get what you deserve"
"Game sucks, get better game"
haha funny robbing game
Gabigol no cruzeiro e Gusttavo Lima na presidência!
low quality game
Won't recommend getting this it's just crashing every time I load into a heist and I can't find anything to help solve this issue and it's sometimes crashes when I start the game I prefer the ps4 version of the game. maybe look at payday 3
Def not and don't buy 3 either
"buggy mess, frustrating to set up"
"big gun go pew pew small gun also go pew pew 

what do that tell u

"The game play is repetitive, the missions are boring, and there are too many paid DLCs."
muy dificl
"Elden Ring runs better on my device. I find this game to be poorly optimized, full of game and lobby breaking bugs."
my game crashed and all of my data just got corrupted :/
roubar e errado
"holy hell this game's player base. i've been ""playing"" for 8 hours but i only played about 4 matches in total because every lobby i try to join, the host would kick me within the first 15 seconds, before the match even starts. Why? idk. my logical guess is that im a new low level player without all the fancy skins. how am i supposed to level up if the community is cancer and doesnt even give me a chance?....

im not even exaggerating when i say that i got kicked from 95 percent of lobbies i joined. Try it yourself."
this game is really disappointing and i didn't enjoy my time playing it
Only fun with friends.
not cool
Yay i love spamming akimbo smg with stoic build SO FUNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Stop crashing piece of shit Game
The best worst game ever made.
Just fix all game breaking bugs that's all I want
It just doesn't click for me.
"Bad stealth mechanics, you stay hidden and walk around planning what to do, then go loud stay loud and fight infinite waves of enemies as you complete time based objectives forcing you to fight the hordes. Entry point on Roblox did this game 100x better for free"

100 gigabytes of dogshit
Janky mechanics that waste your time. 10 dollar game that has 90% of its content locked behind a paywall. customization process is eye barf to look at while doing. was fun for 4 hours then the lack of polishing just shutdown the fun.
yeah
....

Good game but in 26 hours that i have I got stuck in the big oil mission for like 5 hours and i deleted it
shit game friend made me buy and never played it again
"Extremely overrated and static game. wouldnt even buy this on sale. Run in, shoot good guy, take money, and repeat. Extremely grindy and half the game hidden behind a paywall."
NO CROSSPLATFORM I CRASHED OUT WHEN I BOUGHT THIS AND BROKE MY DOWNSTAIRS TV
"im Sorry but there is too many DLCs, buy the game with all DLCs and even then its repetitive just play EDF or Helldivers"
if you want to get any attachments goodluck. everything is a dlc even scopes and ammo types
"Awesome! But... past Mayhem, GarbageBreeze and OverTrash guys don't know s*** about how to make ""good"" harder difficulty. ALL cops sprint at you at the speed of light to get in your face, punch you once and then stand like a damn statue and take 9999 rounds of 7.62 ammo to the face. So just making an army of 10,000 **tard, bullet sponge, hitscan, overpowered idiots is not good enemy design."
"fun with friends, which is a nice way to say it isnt fun
also 3 sucks so if you want payday just play this
really not that interesting though unless your friendgroup all gets together to play it"
Very repetitive game that boils down to a shooting gallery with video game music in the background...
"To say Payday 2 is a good game would be like telling a liberal that Trump is the right president for America - just an outright lie. In my own personal experience, I have watched this game ravage the mind of an already ADHD-riddled child to point that he could play no other game other than GTA V. I have watched this game possess him to ruin friendships and quite possibly the few romantic relationships he has had. The most sadistic thing about this game, is that it's not even that good. It's basically just Call of Duty but you're robbing banks instead of shooting at Afghans or Russians or Chinese people or Japanese for that matter (Call of Duty has featured a wide range of racial minorities for you to kill). But the aforementioned spectrum child seems to think it's the greatest thing since Dragon Ball Z - this kid also plays Destiny 2, so as far as video games go, he's got no taste. 

To call this a video game is an insult to the industry at large. What it really is, is a torture device, as it drove my friends and I to the point of cutting the spectrum child off, because all he would talk about or want to play was this game. 

To it's developers, I implore you, take this game, take every single copy of it, digital or physical and f**king burn them. Burn them all, and save billions of gamers worldwide from this atrocity of a game. And do the other Payday games as well, they deserve to die by association alone. 

Yours sincerely,
a gamer with taste."
the worst optimized game ive ever fucking played in my entire life. Also  one of the only games on the planet where you can play on the lowest setings and still crash at the end of the heist.
it would be better if it was borderlands 2
"its impossible to have the complete game now,  some content got removed due to licence expiring so if you are a new players you will have a forever incomplete game missing characters/content, not worth."
"If you value your time, do NOT buy this for steam deck.

To say I've been having problems playing this ""steamdeck verified"" game would be a complete understatement. I have has so many technical problems getting this game running that it has killed any and all enjoyment I have had on this game. 

My biggest issue is that there is massive desync problems, but not in the way you think.

Through vigorous testing with someone more familiar with linux (since proton is just a fork of linux) here's what they observed: Say theres three people in the lobby. The host, myself, and a third player. If I am not the second player to join the game, it shows that the other player disconnects and vice versa. I HAVE to be the second person to join, and even then its a crapshoot because it takes two to three attemps to even join; making public lobbies virtually unplayable for me. 

So unless you already have friends who are able to tolerate a few resets, if you buy this multiplayer game on steamdeck expecting to play multiplayer, you might as well be playing a single player game with light multiplayer aspects.

Whats worse is that I've spent two weeks getting this hunk of crap to work and thats just a band aid fix until I can find a legitimate solution. 

Ive put in a steam support ticket and I'll wait to comment on that when they get to me, and I went to Starbreeze's support page to see if maybe they had a solution. The only options they gave me was a redurect to the steam forums and a link to their discord server (which despite having over 20k people in it was very inactive).

Payday 2, when it actually wants to work, is a fun game for sure. But I want to play this multiplayer game like A MULTIPLAYER GAME. And I can't do that without massive work arounds that waste more time. Maybe valve needs to re-evaluate their whole steam deck compatability system because clearly this game does not have it."
nice game but boring.
"Don't understand why this game is so popular, trash. Trying to do GO bank heist, cage assembly area never spawns. Tedious game play waiting for drills, lock picks, just all a big progress bar simulator."
I can't recommend this game because it is almost impossible to play solo. People have jobs and can't be online all the time... Or maybe the people that play Payday are playing this game for practice.
"If you buy pd2 now with no dlcs then you are buying a demo to a unfinished poorly optimized and poorly balanced game that got assasinated by its own development team but i guess if you are into that sort of game its kinda fun

except dead sentence is pretty stupid and anything below it is pretty much a baby game for little babys made by (probably) little babys considering how many bugs and exploits there are

Also theres the fact that payday 2 has the worst stealth in any game to ever exist going from waiting in a corner for a guard to move for 10 seconds to waiting multiple minutes doing literally nothing while a timer counts down to be able to enter a vault and move bags for another 5 to 20 minutes depending on the heist while the most nothing soundtrack plays in the background and you regret your choice of ever touching a videogame while knowing that if you get spotted once then you have to do it all over again (and sadly this is the best way to grind xp and reach lvl 100 as fast as possible so you will have to do this for like 60% of your total playtime if you want to have any actual fun considering almost everything is locked behind a lvl barrier but this was partially fixed with 4.0 so i guess its not as bad as it could be) and im not even gonna mention hostages

Loud is fun for the first few hours but after that it becomes just a snore fest where you end up evaporating cops while they stand no chance to beat you and logically you might want to go a higher difficulty until you reach death wish and at that point (atleast in my 
case) most of the fun will come from making builds, seeing your dmg popups and kill count increase (requires mods tho) and just doing random fun stuff with complete liberty if you are good enough and that isnt a bad thing until you decide to try dead sentence and then realize how much artificial difficulty can damage a games fun factor by making most builds almost impossible to play unless you are pretty much a god and by making the game incredibly punishing preventing most fun plays and turning the gameplay into peeking your head killing 2-7 enemies depending on how op your build is and then going back to hiding unless you want to get 1-shot and it could be fun for some people but no thanks if i wanted to do that i would just play something like csgo (except csgo atleast has stuff like smokes and other mechanics that makes it actually interesting ((actually csgo doesn't exist anymore and cs2 is straight up unplayable so just replace it with any other strategy shooter like valorant or r6)) and if you go back to dw it becomes the same snore fest all over again

another thing that annoys me is how astonishingly bad the ui is (thats it i just think the hud is bad and its not really hard to see why ((also i know that you can add mods to make the ui look better but im reviewing the game not the mods made by the fans of the game that would be like giving minecraft a good review only because you like a random mod that changes the game completely))

Also 90% of the game is locked up behind dlc's so thats fun and totally not a scam"
"Updates with bugs, addons behind paywalls destroyed the fun of this game."

"I don't know if anyone also had this problem, but when playing the game I get ghosting. Tried tweaking the settings from high to low. Search online for solutions, but nothing. Maybe it's just me. Running a RTX 3080."
Not good. Feels like a zombie horde game.
"Cant launch game, no error code no nothing. I checked all the files and dll files but nothing. Hit play and the game just wont start. Been wanted to come back and play but can get it to launch."
Most over hyped game.
Awful.
"scummy. most the content is behind 100-150 dollars of dlc. and i payed for that shit. i want my 100 dollars back, almir.

games pretty fun, but seriously, this dlc shit has to go."

Was playing The Biker Heist DLC on DEATH SENTENCE. I finally got the mechanic to build the old dude's bike. His name is Rust probably because he's slowly rusting away from his fucking old age. I tried to drive his motorcycle that literally has 0 acceleration leaving me vulnerable and easy to get killed. I managed to move it forward however there was a BUSH with collision WHY THE FUCK DOES A BUSH HAVE COLLISION! I HATE MY LIFE SO MUCH! I DEDICATED 20 MINUTES TO THIS HEIST RIGHT NOW! I THOUGHT I COULD DRIVE THROUGH A BUSH! QARGHHH
it keeps kicking me out for no reason

"incredibly disappointed with payday too, and I’m not sorry this may be because I’ve played at single player, but I also don’t like Left 4 Dead
see 18:14 in Modern Gaming.

Horde games are just bogus and not for me.

and then they give me an option to stay or leave. OK I only have two life left. I don’t like being a quitter. I’m gonna stay and round up the rest of the bodies and then die trying and waste an hour.

gameplay just be like really competitive sorry repetitive*

my second mission was on I believe over-sized Walter White crystal meth easy bake ovens

I’m deeply regretful that I’ve ran out of synonyms to say sorry to Tom for not liking his* most played game on Steam"
"Payday 2 feels like being stuck in the abyss from SpongeBob—you know, that endless, dark void where nothing makes sense, and you’re just... lost. One minute, you’re trying to do a simple heist, then BOOM—you’re overwhelmed by endless waves of cops, the kind that just won’t stop coming, kind of like the abyss never stops being dark. You try to stay calm, but it's like you're sinking deeper and deeper into chaos, with no way out. The sound of alarms? It's like that eerie, endless echo from the abyss. You think you might be getting away with the loot, but then, surprise, you're trapped in a corner with no hope of escape. It’s like a bad dream, where everything you do only makes things worse. The game’s fun, but also feels like you're falling into the abyss of your own bad decisions. You’re just trying to get the money and leave, but nope—this abyss doesn't let you go."
damn
👎
"I accidentally left this game on so these hours are not legit.

Personally coming from l4d and other horde games this one is the most boring. good soundtrack but everyone wanting to stealth constantly rarely going doing it ""loud"" like they say, is boring. that and there are still bugs like the career ""Getting ready"" task that just doesnt want to complete even though ive done everything it asks.

clearly this game is more for the audience that enjoys Thief type of games and less so for people that play vermintide or l4d.

and to top it off after you pay your $10 trial fee you are expected to pay for each and every dlc if you dont want to miss out on content. and the community will die hard defend this gross decision to constantly ask for money cause they think they get ""free"" content when in reality they are just being scammed.

so dont get this if you expect to have full or even half full game. 75% of the game is locked behind dlc."
"Just kinda... lost its magic I guess, it will always be a game that got me into everything but, its just, not *it* anymore."

"A buggy mess. After installing many, many mods in an attempt to make the game playable, it's not.

Avoid this if you can. It's not worth it. 

100% trash"
"After years of thinking about an awesome game ruined by it's live service, after years of unspoken competition between Killing Floor 2 and Payday 2, I can easily announce that Payday 2 is the ultimate game in that regard. Downgraded visuals, abysmal optimization, broken balance, broken AI, a huge degradation in artstyle, lackluster heists with awful story plots and twists, milking every last penny out of the game. There is no game anymore here. It is a game where you pick 2 builds and either you gun down swarms of enemies (and by that I mean SWARMS) or either you just jump around dodging AIs detection percentages. That's it. You're playing with same IZHMA 12G in loud or ""stealthing"" with the same Judge. Nothing changes.  Absolutely no replayability. All the mechanics that are supposed to make the game replayable were just broken over the course of time. Game is just stale, boring, broken, and laggy. This is the prime example of how not to make your game live service. Starbreeze and Overkill should've gone bankrupt in 2015."
It's necessary to buy atleast 20 DLC's to actually be able to play the game
"Requested refund after 30 mins. shouldn't have to piss around with mods on a VR release just to use smooth turning. 
The game looks good although I never got to start playing because unless you can be bothered messing around with mods the controls are fcking useless. using buttons to rotate? wtf!."
EPIC RUINED THIS GAME I HATE EPIC
"In the past this game was great, now this game just crashes for no reason, wouldn't recommend atm, creators just want you to buy payday 3 so they broke this game"
"business stuff:
this ip was murdered by the company who bought it! 
the sequel was also assassinated by the same company with bad business decisions and a lack of focus early on in development! (i still respect the developers i doubt it was easy to deal with the things that led to that)
the payday ip is now going to be thrown at other series to make the money back on payday 3 :) WE'RE DOOOOMED!
(dooming the most popular ip you own for dungeons and dragons live service game is crazy in my opinion but im not a businessbot so what do i know?)

the payday 2 review:
its very easy to throw a few hours at it and have fun! you just have to be aware it is a mess of a game with no future development support (modders have made attempts but starbreeze has left the game in a permanently More unstable state) i actually do recommend this game at its cheapest but i cant give this game a positive review because of Events! there is *Alot* of history in this game and i do think thats worth remembering."
"I love this game. I really do, but I can not in my heart recommend it to anyone. You need to shill out SO MUCH money to even get the most enjoyable heists in the game, and not to mention all the bugs and crashes that can outright ruin your game experience. And let's not even open the can of worms that is the mods. The mods are amazing, don't get me wrong, but Overkill REFUSES to fix this broke dick piece of shit game. If, on the rare chance, they decide to make a MAJOR fix for the game and remake the game in an engine that ISN'T A RACING GAME ENGINE, then I would consider recommending it to others for a fun while, but until then, the only ""loot"" you'll be getting out of this bank is a bundle of frustration and ruined moods."
sigma game
"Looks good but key critical flaws in first mission. NPC teammates stand in your way when trying to throw loot into the back of the van. I can't make the hostage move, he just stands there. Surprising flaws for a game that has had several updates since release. I can't even complete the first mission."
Im fucking sick of this game sending me a hundred fucking notifications a day
"I pay to play the game and hop on to see that 60% of the content is locked behind paid DLCs.

At the time of writing this there are 77 DLCs. Why? If I want to play with my friends I have to shell out more money for other DLCs."
Tried to play this with my friends. Did not work.
don't really like multiplayer games so i never really played it
Garbage netcode makes multiplayer almost unplayable and very frustrating.
Trash
"Got this game because I love thief and heist based media. Playing it the game seemed very unresponsive to certain actions such as moving hostages which made it fairly annoying. The game feels less like I'm a thief and more like a shooter/mass murderer. Not really the vibe i was going for, I've since refunded the game."
"waiting simulator, trash game"
"No borderless windowed & I don't know a better avenue for feedback
Not the only complaint I have but I would have to actually think to come up with pretty much anything else. Great game!"
"one of those games for which i wish that there was a mixed option one could choose when writing a review here

not gonna go for a long tangent as i value my time so i'll keep it short

if you want casual fun, by all means go ahead and buy it and have a grand old time with your mates
if you're a completionist, this game will become your personal hell"
"I dont understand how i played, gathered money and bought skins, mods, sights, mags, weapons etc. AND NOW I CANNOT PLAY WITH THEM . Why would you put my earned items behind ""new DLC"" content walls ???"

"Pay 10$ on discount sale only to play for a couple days, built up some cash and skills/perks, then tried to do my story chapters. Turns out you NEED to buy DLC just to play the 4th mission in the VERY 1ST CHAPTER?? Mkayyyyyyy greedy ass devs. No wonder why Payday 3 flopped"
Fucking shit
"Reduce the file size of this game i'm begging you, i remember the start of this game where it was launched as 20 GB, there's literally no reason to reuse the same assets that increase the file size just to load faster"

"Shotgun I used way before is now locked to me, the reason is I need to connect their third party account for use. I still have the shotgun in the inventory, I just can't equip it. Why the hell are they removing existing functionality instead of adding something new. Good job starbreeze, just let the game go, no one wants to play payday 3."
THIS GAME IS BOOOOOOOOORING
Crap Game
the game is pretty fun but the reliance of it on dlcs is just laughable

Pretty fun for the ten minutes you get to play before it crashes on startup
"As of the new updates this game went into the garbage , they made the ai so fucking stupid you have to finagle  the hostages so much until you get them to where you want , not to mention the updates to the loud part of the game , you literally get swarmed with enemies at random , not to mention it became so that you can't fucking learn it as a beginner or intermediate , I would only recommend to get this game on sale."
game keeps crashing every time i open it

"While PAYDAY 2 offers a fun co-op experience at its core, the game's reliance on DLC is a major turn-off. The base game feels incomplete and lacking in content, leaving players feeling like they're constantly missing out on something."

this game fucking sucks
Unlocked every dlc with a dlc unlocker HAHA!
"There is a good game hidden somewhere in here.

Not anything, anywhere near good enough to excuse the insane amount of paid DLCs, especially when the current game is a shell of its former self due to hidden patch changes to the AI behaviour and spawning.

If you really want to experience a payday game, grab Payday: The Heist on a steam sale and enjoy that instead."
Hostages are bugged. Some missions are impossible to do
"Linux version crashes to desktop. Can play with Proton, but it's a convoluted UI that pushes DLC purchases way too much. I've heard multiplayer is no longer functional for Linux players, but can't confirm it.

I see why people say it turned into a microtransaction cash grab.

update: The above is still true, but I must admit the game is fun. Would I suggest buying it? No. No game that puts out a modest amount of mostly cosmetic content and charges over $200 for it (or something like $112 on the current half off sale) is going to get a recommendation from me. If you have good self control and won't likely find yourself wanting to buy the guns, modifications, skins, etc. that are locked behind additional purchases, it may be worth it. If you find yourself wasting money on absurdly greedy DLC locked content... avoid like the plague."
"Payday 2 is a good game fundamentally. It does what it wants to do well. However this game has a multitude of issues and bugs. I have had more issues playing this game than most others on steam. It has a tendency to crash or boot people from the game, and with all the dlcs locked or removed makes this game jarring at best, and frustrating at worst. If you like horde shooters, and can tolerate bugs, then more power to you friend, otherwise find another game."

"Game Review: PAYDAY 2

Score: 1/10 - A Liberal Heist Disguised as Entertainment!

I am beyond shocked they let you play as the thieves. I bought this hoping to stop CRIMINALS -- I am a blue collar American!

Let me tell you, folks, PAYDAY 2 is a prime example of how the gaming industry has been infiltrated by a dangerous liberal agenda! What might seem like an exhilarating heist simulator is, in fact, a clever disguise for promoting social unrest, glorifying criminal behavior, and brainwashing players into accepting a progressive narrative that undermines traditional values!

The Heist as Political Commentary?

In this game, you and your crew don masks and embark on a series of heists—seemingly harmless fun, right? Wrong! Each mission is drenched in leftist propaganda, portraying criminal acts as justifiable responses to the “oppressive capitalist system.” The game wants you to sympathize with these masked criminals, turning lawbreakers into heroes! It’s as if the developers are saying, “Hey, if the system is corrupt, why not take from the rich?” This blatant theft of morality should raise alarms for every freedom-loving player out there!

Endless Liberal Messaging!

As you progress through the game, you’ll encounter characters who spout nonsensical liberal ideologies. They talk about fighting against the “man,” encouraging players to view themselves as revolutionaries. The glorification of theft and the dehumanization of law enforcement present a troubling narrative that undermines the very fabric of our society. Who needs police when you have a ragtag group of masked criminals, right? This is the kind of thinking that leads to chaos in the streets!

The Masked Agenda: A Facade for Cultural Marxism

The very concept of wearing masks in PAYDAY 2 is a metaphor for the liberal agenda! It promotes the idea that you can hide your true identity while committing acts that go against societal norms. This encourages players to adopt a “who cares about the rules” mentality! It’s a psychological operation designed to desensitize us to criminal activity and manipulate our perceptions of right and wrong. Before you know it, you’re rooting for the bad guys, and that’s exactly what they want!

Cooperation or Collusion?

And let’s talk about teamwork. The game encourages players to work together to execute these heists, but this is just a thinly veiled excuse for creating a community of like-minded liberal sympathizers. You’re not just playing a game; you’re being indoctrinated into a collective mindset that celebrates the dismantling of traditional values. What’s next? A co-op mode that encourages players to loot their neighbors' houses? The idea of unity in criminality is a clear attempt to normalize anti-establishment sentiments!

Final Thoughts: Resist the Liberal Onslaught!

In conclusion, PAYDAY 2 is a dangerous vehicle for spreading liberal ideologies disguised as a fun heist game. It’s a call to arms for those who want to tear down the very foundations of our society while making it seem like a thrilling adventure. We cannot let ourselves be seduced by the allure of digital crime! This game deserves a score of 1/10 for being a thinly veiled attack on our values and for promoting a dangerous agenda that glorifies lawlessness.

Stay vigilant, gamers! Don’t let PAYDAY 2 or any game like it manipulate your mind into accepting chaos as entertainment!"
"I spent hours and hours on this game that were wasted by crashing at the end of the heist. I ran DS/OD heists, maxing out my loadouts for loud. I can solo stealth any heist. I got the 1000 achievements milestone. TLDR: I'm a fan.

Now, I drop this game. Things have never been this bad. You lost yourself a player that would've bought most of your DLCs over stupid decisions and poor optimalization."

"So many troll players who ruins the Escape and No Point of Return part of the game. They hang around outside the escape zone before the time limit ends, or waiting for us to die so they can take our loot for themselves. I wish they don't receive the end game rewards rather than penalizing the whole heist team -_-

Too bad its a great game, but it's so filled with toxic players."
yeaeaaaaaahhhhhhhh weeee getttt paiiiiiddddddddd f_u_c_k neighbourrrrrrr
"have the devs never played a vr game before? this is one of the worst controlling vr games ive ever played. for starters if you want to turn left or right you dont flick the analog stick, you have to press a button. so every time you turn you have to stop moving to turn.

theres also hardly any controls when it comes to the weapons. you cant do anything aside from firing and reloading and even then its the bare minimum.

now all of this might be tolerable if you could change the controls, but you cant. you are stuck with what they give you.

if you are playing vr this is a hard pass."
"Waste of money if you don't plan to play it regularly with friends. 
Just gets too repetetive and boring after one point. 
The graphics look meh and the game overall feels cluncky.
Fun for first 3-4 games yes, after that not anymore.
5/10"
game very funy HAHAHAHHAHAHA! I like when YOU CAN PUT CAT ON GUN XDDDDDDDD and theres more where that came from!!! lots of dark humor and chuckles WITH THIS ONE! but i must be very carful... if my mom see me palying this game ill be GROUNDSED for like FOREVER AND THEN MY LITTLE BROTER WILL HAVE MY COMPUTER INSTEAD OF ME I HATE MY LITTLE BROTHER I WISH HE WASNTR BORN i shouldnt say that that is mean BUT IT IS JUST HOW I FEEL SOMETIMES!!!!!!!!!! so basicly dont let your mom watch you play this game..... other than that its ok
"Dethroned by Epic Games update, which completely made the multiplayer broken. Even basic P2P isn't working anymore. At this point I feel like the studio broke it on purpose to try to force as many people as possible to buy their shitty third game."
"well, i did the tutorial and thought, wow, this game is pretty cool! but then when i started playing the first mission, well, it was not fun at all. I mean, I was totally invincible. I took a lot of shots, but it didn't even come close to me dying. me and my team killed a lot of CT bots, pretty easy. not fun. I barely took any damage and we must have killed over 100 bots. that was not fun at all. too easy. not challenging at all. like watching that stupid ass movie: john wickie, lol. i like action movies and games, but damn. this is definitely not for me! 5/10"
"TLTD; Do copies of your game save. 

Decided to download Payday 2 back, and enjoy some good memories. Opened the game- Corrupted,  cannot be saved, erasing. 
Lost everything.. My levels, weapons, masks, money. Gone. I tried googling about it, and turns out this shit has been in the game since it came out?? And it still is here. Why can't the developers love their game enough. 

All I can do now is uninstall. o7"

"this is the most overrated coop game of all time
its so fucking buggy and crashes so fucking much
its super inconsistent

the heist design is often incredibly boring and is almost always ""wait for a drill"" or ""wait for a hack""

have i mentioned how buggy and broken this game is btw? i hope ive hammered that in. the only thing this shit has going for it is good buildcrafting but even then its super flawed since theres teammate griefing skills and a bunch of outright useless perk decks. the worst part? it wasnt like this 7 years ago, even 2 years ago it wasnt this bad. please spend your money on something else"
Steaming pile of trash. I do not understand why it has a cult following. The game is litteraly unplayable from all the bugs and the community because after one hour i did not manage to play 1! FULL!! GAME!!!. And even when you manage to play it it's not even good.
"One of the worst game on steam, whenever I play with my friends we are losing no matter what, even if it sitting in corner in game they’re losing but at the moment I leave THEY WIN EVERYTHING WITH EASE. I highly not recommend this awful creation"

"Absolute garbage. I bought this for my VR and at first it worked and now the game doesn't even start. I reinstalled it a couple of times and check the game integrity and nothing works. I tried launching the game on pc, it doesnt work. For the time that this game worked the controls were terrible as well. Worst purchase to make."
"Game has fell off badly, cant even join a friends lobby thanks to the shit with epic. Went to shit, just like everything else online."
Same as dayz lame lame lame
fuck ds alesso heist stealth final section
"I love this game, it is one of my favourites of all time being something I played for years across the xbox and PC, however due to constant crashes and the amount of dlc dictation of how you can play the game, I simply cannot recommend this game for everyone. It is and will be a game I love, when it functions, but the amount of issues it has had can't be ignored so I can't recommend it... I hope it'll be functional at some point in the future"
"Decently entertaining shooter with stealth and loud options to complete a given mission. Once you've done a mission, you've practically done most of them, and the gunplay doesn't feel the best. The game also has this general sense of jankyness, which is not ideal for a fast paced cops and robbers FPS. You can find better."
There is little variety in the game without buying add-ons
DLC milking
more like gayday 2
"Good:
Pretty fun to play and have a good way to bond with strangers. Stealth is a lot more fun because you can play with more risks and fast-paced other than resorting to gunblazing everywhere.

Bad:
Downtime is horrendous and you're stuck playing a wave of artificial fuckery whose damage is superficially increased to the max to discourage armor-type users. You're forced to play a certain way in order to complete the mission unscathed or else you'll get punished for every mistake you make due to the AI's tomfoolery of pathfinding. You're not allowed a lot of freedom for something that focuses on crime."
Boring as shit
gayyyyy
"this is the only game ive ever played that gives me motion sickness. dont know why, never been motion sick in vr. but this game is the exception."
It was good for the first few hours. After that It got rather bland and repetitive. I wish more stealth mechanics were implemented.
Not fun
"Don't buy this game, it's a complete scum, it works for one week, then you'll not be ever able to launch it again or it will just crash"
there is no skibidi
.
"1328 achievements? Nope, not with me.

I have mroe than 0.5h (played mostly offline). I like the setting/idea of the game. But that everything has to be an achievement is just plain stupid."
game gets angry at me for killing civilians
"its fun but..prepare to be able to do little without dlc...also getting the gun is easy, its getting anything useful thats hard."
狗屎
Payday2 more like Paydaypoo
IQ tests are mandatory before access to multiplayer
"Can't even open the game
Recommend this game 10/1000"
"i came back to this absolute dog pile trash can game after 6 years and its somehow even worse than when i quit the first time. i dont know how i didn't write a review 6 years ago for this pile of shit, but this time i wont miss. this shit is so bad it makes call of duty look slightly better. dont even think about going back to this game if you quit previously, its not worth it, this game is still a solid turd that should be avoided at all costs, DLC included."
"recently played the first time, here's my biggest problem with the game 

-Everything is a DLC. Gun attachments, weapons, heists (missions) are starting at you 24/7 with the dreaded 3 letter word

-Missions are explained VERY poorly. Some part of the heist you will need a specific item. 90% of the time its never mentioned where the item is and its never highlighted until a long time has passed. Spent a solid 5 min with friends finding a gasoline tank thats placed nowhere near a car and instead under some random table in a level.

-I still dont know what each gun stat is or wtf are perk decks and how is it different from skills. nothing is ever explained properly.

gameplay is fine except for some odd hitbox that makes you unable to hit around the edges of shields/level geometry. I will tear the limbs of the UI designer out for including DLCs item for non-owner instead of hiding it until purchase like a normal human being deserving of respect."
Fun game teehee
roubaram minha dlc do scarface pack ://///////////
no replays
Don't even try to play if you are new.  Every server kicks you instantly.
"fun game, but i was only able to play for 2 hours before i got extremely sick. had to sleep it off. head bobbing is too much even with it turned off for when you are sprinting (the only option)"
overrated
I was lucky enough to get into it while it was still good. Unfortunately the devs' compulsive need to make as much money as possible via MTX ruined it for me. I don't really see how they can justify 40-60 dollars for mtx on a game that's 10 dollars at full price. The gameplay itself is a great time (Albeit repitive)
One word: Greed.
"It's so, damn, expensive. For what? A game that's fun for a few hours?"
Latest update trashed the game
its mid
"It was a good game. Then Overkill made deal with epic that ruined servers. Some time passed and it was playable again. And now, they made an update to a ""Dead game"" fucking everything up. Ever since it uses epic infrastructure, it went to shit. Loading times now last 100 years, restarting heist is another 200 years. EOS is less stable than steam, no idea why they made this dumb decission to switch from semething that worked."
"This is a piece of shit. First my friend had problems connecting ton lobbies online after the Epipc Games store connection, but ok, bad luck. But after recent ""maintenence"" update I can't even connect to EPIC GAME STORE SERVERS while playing on Steam, and that's stopping me from playing online? That is enough, Overkill. Remove this from the store if you can't even play this game.

It used to be good, but after the epic game store update it is UNPLAYABLE.

DO NOT BUY THIS SHIT!!! I AM 100% SERIOUS!!! YOU WILL WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
"First one was great, but then second one is Pay to Win or youb need all the DLCs"
Bring Jimmy back
Fix the revoked DLC for licensed characters and content. Literally killing the legacy of the game for people that have been playing for 10 years.
I hate the dumb evidence thing
give us jimmy back Shitbreeze
They removed jimmy
"It's with a heavy heart that I leave a not recommended on this game because I truly do love it and I've sank so much time into it, but the developers have not taken very good care of it in the last year. They caused multiple issues in the last few updates and have been very slow to fix them due to most of the effort being put towards Payday 3 currently. The gameplay loop of both loud and stealth gameplay is satisfying but I find myself unable to even enjoy the former at times due to random freezing, at which point my only option is to close the game. That was an issue caused by a recent update and maybe it was fixed in the update released on September 12 (today as of me writing this) but it's hard to enjoy a game I cannot play, much less a game that is now having content removed for one reason or another."
The biggest heist in this game is the one where Starbreeze stole Jimmy from us.
"They removed jimmy, made it so no one can play him even though players who had already bought the game could play as the licensed characters."
Eh. Not great. Also ruined my sensitivity forever.
dog shit
"Terrible Bug Ridden Piece Of Garbage. Devs put ""Dead Game"" merch with descriptions crying about how people were saying it's dead. Well it is. PD3 is too. Loser ass devs."
"It was fun playing with friends. I thought I'd get back to playing it this year, after the last time I played it was in 2016.

Now I just found out that it integrates the Epic Online Services telemetry. Read more about it here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2986800410

The  EOSSDK-Win32-Shipping.dll is located in your PAYDAY 2 folder: ...\steamapps\common\PAYDAY 2

What is EOS: It's Epic's version of Steamworks. A set of tools that allow save syncing, crossplay, achievements and other features of the sort. However, it's tied to Epic's servers, which are known for being spotty for anything but Fortnite. Worse so, developers have added EOS retroactively to games without telling their customers, creating connection problems on products that were working fine.

EOS is capable of doing telemetry calls which should be mostly hardware, software and game session data. But could be further expanded to include more. There are also reports of the software reading information from your computer about your games and computer use habits which can be considered an invasion of privacy. 

About the game itself, PAYDAY 2, it being a crime simulator, I don't think it is a good idea to train your own mind to simulate crimes."
smiecie
"Suddenly half of my inventory is disabled because I ""have to make a forum account or join the official Steam group"", which I have done both of, and I still can't use any of the attachments I have owned for years. Broken game. Will revise my review if I am allowed to play."
crash simulator 9000
it keep freezing while i am playing
"EVER SINCE LINKING TO NEBULA BECOME A THINK,EVERY TIME I PLAY THIS GAME MY INVENTORY ALWAYS BEEN LOCKED,I JUST HOPE YOU GOING BANKRUP FOR THIS"
"I used to love this game years ago. I decided to try it out again with some friends to introduce them to the game, but it has become such a goddamn mess. 

The UI is a cluttered POS, some clients inexplicably don't have an ""invite friends"" button, while others don't have the ability to paste invite codes. Even when trying to join through steam friends, it fails for no reason. 

I'd get into it more, but it's just not worth it. Trying to navigate all the nonsense in the menus is an exercise in moon logic that i wouldn't wish on anyone.

Don't buy this game. If you already have it, save yourself the trouble of downloading it."
I don't want Epic Online Services running on my computer. It wasn't like that when I bought the game months ago.
If you didn't play it untill now you won't like it
They fucked it
this game was great once but now i have to make an account to use the dlc i have from before and it wont let me join games with friends wtf
"WAS A GOOD GAME!!!
Overkill did it again and left the game to DIE, not to mention that this game saved them in the past!(after it was abandoned the first time)
Random crashes making the game unplayable and PD community page following has to be renewed every day!
P.S PD3 is shite so far"
delisting heists is kinda wack yo (it's still wack)
Just No
not fun after 100 hours
"To say that this is one of the worst games of all time now would be an understatement. I genuinely do not comprehend the sheer retardation of those who are giving this positive reviews. It used to be fun years ago but the dumbass greedy swedish reddit developers have ruined it. Now the police assaults wont ever end and you have to face a million enemies during the assaults. How is it fair that you can't get into cover at all and recover your armor? You just get endlessly hit by enemies. The enemies are also ridiculously op now as they are basically all minibosses in the hardest difficulties.

The game was never that good years ago anyways. Every single mission is the same thing. Whether you are stealing, killing, creating, or protecting, every single mission just boils down to hold f and wait minutes for something, then restart the thing because it has jammed or been shut down, repeat that multiple times.

The game has also turned into a massive bugfest as it will crash randomly for no reason at all, doesn't even give crash messages, it just shuts down. For some people I played with, the game freezes their pc. Starbreeze Nebula doesn't even work. The AI is so shit they often just camp at a corner of the map staring at a wall. There is no tactics from them either as all they ever do is charge you.

You tell it is a Swedish game due to the greedy DLC spam. 78 DLC and you need them all due to the starter weapons being trash. You can't play a lot of the missions without DLC. You can't even play their garbage career mode with friends unless you have a bunch of the DLC. Getting most masks is also purely RNG based so if you want a specific mask because it looks cool or for a achievement then you might as well cope because it might take thousands of hours to get it. You can also tell it is a Swedish game due to the all of the shitty meme reference achievements and them not listening to their players at all. 

Thankfully though this game is dying and hopefully Starbreeze along with it. Payday 3 is one of the worst games of all time and for Payday 2 only 35% of players have even reached reputation 50, only 15,5% have reached reputation 100. And if you don't believe me that it is dying here are the statistics:
247,628 all time player peak. In January this year the player peak was 45,479, in August it was 22,580.

If you want to know just how shit Starbreeze is then look up Starbreeze Studios on Wikipedia. Endless drama and stupid decisions. It is just one big Swedish fail.

Do not buy this game in 2024 and beyond, it is not worth it. Matter of fact, don't even buy any Swedish games at all, they are all buggy grindy dlc spam games."
"Let's start with the positives:
1. Nice voice acting. The ally bots have voices and have personality
2. It has actual offline singleplayer, few games have that nowadays

Now the negatives:

1. Most of the game is locked behind DLC. Don't let the $10 base price tag fool you, because less than ~40% of the game is base game. I browsed through the levels and weapon choices, it was astounding how everything was DLC. Here's a fun one: only 1 sniper rifle is included in the base game, the other ~10 sniper rifles are DLC. If you plan to buy this game, know that the real price is well beyond $100.

2. Even after you paid for the game, they still bug you to make a ""Starbreeze account"" or follow the Payday 2 steam community. Remember how only 40% of the game is included at base? Of the weapons and equipment available, I'd say about 40% is unavailable to you unless you make an account or follow Payday 2. Yes, you've paid for the game, but you still have to go out there and make an account just so you can play your game, even though you already have a Steam account. That 1 sniper rifle earlier? Go follow Payday 2 on Steam. Oh, and for some reason the follow is bugged, you gotta unfollow and refollow on every play session for it to realise and unlock you the stuff.

3. The main menu has really high sensitivity for some reason, and there's no way to fix that in the settings. What's worse, the menu is quite cluttered; a new player has no idea what is going on with all the different buttons on screens.

4. And then there are more minor things like how hostages are broken; you can't move hostages around because they just stop moving after 2 seconds.

Overall, I would not recommend this game. Having everything as DLC is a stab to an already paying customer, and the requirement to make an account just to access the little bit you've paid for is salt for the wound."
I NEEEEEEEEEEED A MEDIC BAGGGG!!! So does Payday 3.
Really only fun when you have friends to play with.
Brain-dead AI enemies just rush in to players like zombies. It's just a meaningless zombie shooter.
"Half the game is locked behind a paywall. You can play with just the base game, but most of the weapon mods require paying again. And the second price is vastly more than the initial investment. Big surprise. A pack with all the DLC is over $100. Just another scumbag company preying on idiots who pay for microtransactions."
"locking my guns i paid for because i need to join a group that im already in or make a starbreeze nebula account. nonsense.

FUCK YOU OVERKILL AND FUCK YOU STARBREEZE NEBULA"
"game won't even launch anymore, and pd3 sucks. pd3 sucks so hard i'll review pd2 poorly, also, i mean, i can't play the game, so that matters too. (yes i've reached out, no i haven't gotten help)."
"Destryoed the damn game, lost all my progression, it frequently crashes and as if a terrible joke they added dead game cosmetics as if their new title is anything like this masterpiece that they have slaughtered. I LOST 100 LEVELS OF INFAMY."

Cannot recommend it though. The game has a history of brokenness, especially on Linux. Online multiplayer has also taken a turn for the worse. The game also has a history of including spyware. Give this one a pass."

"Weapons, mods, and heists are locked behind joining the community group or setting up a Starbreeze Nebula account. Unfortunately, even if you do both of these things, you still may not have access to the community content. This also locks you out of other mods that you can only unlock by doing challenge runs in missions that you don't have access to despite doing everything that should be required to gain access to them."
Would love to actually play the game.
:(

"I love having my items re-locked because they want us to use their accounts we didn't need before! Amazing, 10/10 idea"
Great if you want to waste 2 hours just to get touched by a juggernaut in the last 30 seconds of the mission
"cant connect with my friends, this game's stupid"
"ебанутое произведение долбоебов без мозгов и адекватности. я очень надеюсь что разработчики совместно пойдут и стрелнут в голову, а еще долбоебы направтье на себя огнемет неся полиц броню и посмотрите как быстро вы превратитесь в уголек, идите блядь переделывайте нахуй."
One word: boring! Is just not for me.
I wouldn’t recommend buying this game for more than 5 euros. A lot of content is locked behind DLCs and many of the missions are pretty bland. So far the only time I've genuinely had fun playing the game is during stealth missions.
"There was a time I'd recommend this game to others, but with whatever update it was that completely broke VR, that ship has long since passed. While I enjoy this game both in and out of VR, the Payday 2 VR was just a little more fun. Now any attempts to launch Payday 2 VR are met with massive lag and CTD. With the mess that is Payday 3 being out now, I don't expect this issue to be fixed at any point in the future if at all."
TRASH
"I'm sure the game in it self is good, but not my type."
decent
cannot sex gun
Would love to actually play the game.
Everything that I once had unlocked is now either held behind an account creation requirement or is now a DLC item. Piece of shit fucking game.
no
This game is Shit. Do not buy Rainbow Six either. Fuck em.
shit
"refuses to boot anymore.

game WAS fun but i can't recommend it anymore as i cant fucking play it
not to mention i couldnt join my friends!

few years ago? great game
now? buggy piece of shit mess

still better than payday 3 though"
Its a good game but its been ruined by modders and hackers
piridas
">be on crime spree level 139
>game freezes
>mouse and keyboard are locked up so i cant use the windows key neither alt f4
>have to restart pc by the button on the pc
>you have failed your crime spree, pay a bazillion continental coins to continue"
only good thing abt the game is the sound track apart from that this game is pretty terrible
"Absolute garbage repetetive and outdated gameplay, good luck not crashing (even with top of the line hardware)."
so i have had a lot of issues with the game such as it wont open! i even got a new PC upgrading from laptop to PC which can handle the game and still wont open worst part is i cant even get a refund for the game because the times it did open and let me  play its clocked me at over 10hours playing and you cant get a refund from that not worth the money or time spent playing the game ! highly disappointed because ive seen you tubers play this game and really enjoying watching it and wish to be able to play it and experience it myself
.
fun game just... after awhile it gets boring(in my opinion)
pjaunius
"There was a time this would have been an easy sale to anyone. But the same bumbling retards that brought us such an amazing game as Payday 3 got to make an update. And update that brought back such great features as crashing, glitches, bugs and desync. It's so bad that it makes me wonder if this was done on purpose. Because to fuck up the game is one thing but to not at least undo the changes for over SIX GOD DAMNMONTHS!?! And even with the problems it's still less of a shitshow then Payday 3. Whoever the retard driving the short bus for decisions for Payday 2 or 3 needs to go."
"This the GTA Online of the Payday series. 

[list]
	[*]Stupid over the top weapons like a minigun, flamethrower or longbow
	[*]Unnecessary story line to make the antiheroes like Robin Hood-esque good guys
	[*]Pay to win mechanics through perk decks. 
	[*]Downgrade from the first. Characters do not interact with each other or the heist, its generic lines from the mission handler.
	[*]Difficulties are absurd. Its not about enemies being better is about being more and having more health. I saw 5 dozers within 10 minutes on Brooklyn Bank - Mayhem. (I know its the 3 highest difficulty but to see 5 of the toughest cops in first 10 mins shows you how they treat the game difficulties)
	[*]Countless of variations to complete heists,  however it seems as though the devs followed the streamers and metas and made the heists unplayable after Very Hard unless you run around in your pants, wielding silenced shotguns, a dodge build with 3 lives and RNG.

Game description key-points: a Multiplayer game, a bit of fun

Overview:
pathetic game design! yuuuuuck!
after so many years, did not improved a sh&*!"
"Buggy, unsatisfying gunplay, repetitive gameplay, just an overall boring game."
Sad :(
"This game was bad even before it got worse bro. It's like good idea written on a paper and literally nothing else.  But the ""good idea"" is 100 gb and filled with hackers."
game doesnt even fucking launch shit game
overrated imo but i havent played too much yet.
"5/10
This game is the big stinky 
it constantly crashes and has issues"
"Game crashes more than the amount of car crash incidents in the whole world per year, even without mods. Gameplay is generally repetitive despite the RNG elements. Doesn't help that the game also has terrible optimization and runs on an engine meant for racing games (which, ironically vehicles behave terribly in this game). People will argue to get mods, but it's your responsibility to ensure people can play the vanilla game normally. 

I played with some of my friends that were new to the game, and it's very clear that they're struggling with a lot of the objectives and the game mechanics. Some were mostly due to new experience, but in most cases they struggle with mechanics that are very complex unless you have deep knowledge about the game mechanics or have someone else helping you on it. As previously mentioned, asking them to ""just install mods"" is like giving a cake that tastes bad but just asking the critic to put a lot of sweeteners on it. It's better, but you're not fixing the core problem that the game already has. The only reason people give this game a positive review is two things: either being very power-creeped in game that they forgot how hard it is for new players to climb up to their place, or mostly just to make a review joke and forgot about the core issues of the game.

The game was never good to begin with (whole repetitive objective stuff); and with each passing year they just dug their grave deeper with this game."
Only good with Mods
I'd rather stare at a blank wall
"I spend 1 hour doing the White House heist on the highest difficulty, just when i'm about to escape with the helicopter the game crashed, it has never crashed before. It almost felt like a joke. They need to optimize their game much better."
"Some missions can be incredibly hard on even very hard difficulty, which despite the name, is on the lower end of difficulty settings, and is the difficulty you are forced to play the 'story mode' on. How does the game make itself challenging? It isn't strategy, fast reactions, unique objectives or whatever, it is by having 100 armoured dudes with super high damage shooting at you at the same time. It takes a Bulldozer 1 second to kill me and they spawn constantly, some missions also involve such an obscene amount of enemies with no cover that it is impossible to recover your armour. Generally the original heists will be hard to lose, even on Overkill difficulty, but some newer missions just seem to love huge open areas with ridiculous spawn rates and no cover.

The game also crashes. I hate games that crash, and it isn't just me, all my friends crash to varying degrees.

DLC spam too. The base game has ONE (1!!!) light machine gun without DLCs.

Gameplay is extremely repetitive. Every single mission involves walking to a spot, pressing F, and waiting for minutes while fighting off thousands of the same few enemies. The few times the game is mixed up a bit (escort, puzzles, etc) it is even worse. When facing an objective that requires finding clues, you have to fight for several minutes straight just to get a 20 second break from enemies to read things in the environment.

If you try to play through the career (story) mode with friends (since, yaknow, you bought this game, and it is a multiplayer game) you may expect you can do that. Nope. Partway through it gives you missions you cannot invite friends to. You are not paying for a complete product here, you are paying for a little sliver of the whole game.

This is one of the many steam games where you should look at player retention instead of being wowed by the positive review score. Only a third of players have reached level 50 in this game, which does not take very long (maybe 15 hours if you start out slow with some normal missions and build up). Only 5% of players have done the Classic Heists on Hard+ difficulty, which anyone can do. The player retention is terrible, most people who dropped it just don't bother leaving a negative review because they either pretend they will play the game again later or don't think they have enough experience to judge it. There also seems to be a culture on steam where people are afraid to leave negative reviews of popular products because they might get jester awards."
"Контора Пидорасов, медленно убивают игру чтобы мы начали играть в пейдей 3, Да идите вы нахуй!"
"I DO NOT WANT TO REMAKE MY CLASSES EVERY TIME I SIGN INTO PAYDAY, FACK THE STARBREEZE ACCOUNT INTRODUCTION"
"Was fun for certain amount of time. Certain heists were great and mastering with friends was alot of fun, until newer missions came out that were all about making a last stand and getting away alive. Rework to perks was not received well in our circle and in the end, the game lost its magic for us, and it wasn't even about the money, we had all the money we could ever use.

In words of certain someone ,,It's not about the money. Its about sending a message"".

Newer heists were simply lacking, some achievements were added so late, that it just felt even more insulting that its now an achievement what we did on daily basis. Loot boxes were the breaking point where most of us dropped from the game."
垃圾游戏 一直闪退
A waste of money in every sense of the phrase.
"Get Instant Freeze screen or Disconnected when the match almost complete in online mode . 
Waste of time ."
"Outdated game, erased all of my progress after reinstall."
ывфыПЯ
"Give me your money!

Literally"
Please make a 64 bit version
possibly the worst monetization of any game outside of cod its absurd how much money it costs to experience the entirety of payday 2
fuck this game it sucks it help people get the shit done L
"The game won't let me play. After i opened it and when the Starting screen shows up, my game suddenly turns black then close."
"The gameplay is pretty terrible in this I was surprised. Also it has Ron Pearlman, Ethan and Hila Klein in it for some reason. Super jewish and unoriginal game all around, the masks look dumb, the music is bad, the graphics and animations are bad. Tons of paywall content etc. Its just a cheap rip-off of Heat and The Dark Knight."
"it's fun for about an hour with a friend, but other than that, it's a scummy money grab, more than half of the weapons are DLC. Don't waste your money."
too many midget monkeys grabbing on to my genitals
"A very unreliable playing experience. I lost 20 minutes of work because my game CTD (I'm playing with absolutely no mods) and I tried rejoining, but once i was in the lobby it wouldn't let me spawn in even after waiting another 5 minutes.

Absolute scam, and waste of your time. Uninstalled. 

I will never play this game again, and I will not touch it with even a 10 foot stick, seriously who makes a game this unplayable?"
"Hey Overkill or Starbreeze, Fix your fucking game! It crashes when I'm in the middle of a heist and I lost several Crime Waves because of this! Do something about it! I've done everything i can do!

If anyone can try to help me with the crashing, please leave a comment. I'm very frustrated."
life was good before opening this game
:thumbs down:
"its an awesome game ! LOTS of fun 

But i cannot recommend it, your game will randomly crash allllll the time 
imagine grinding a heist for 1hr + and you get NOTHING because the host crashed 

Great game, but absolute garbage server/host mechanics"
"can i unbuy it for steam points
i wana get payday3"
"Bought to play in VR and just crashes, also needs a shit tone of mods to even be good but hey i wouldnt know cause i cant get past the main screen even though ive tried every fix google could provide. Great work lads!"
"Getting more crashes after coming back to the game than ever before. Not sure why it's having so many problems, had crashing with Payday before obviously but nowhere near this much. 

I suspect something to do with last few updates. Really ruins it as you just end up losing the last 10 or more minutes of gameplay."
"There are two ways to play this game: stealth or aggressive gunfight. The first way is impossible with randoms. The second way is much less fun then other ""Left4Dead"" like games. There are no reasons to play this solo in 2024."
one of the worst out here 10/10
"It used to be a near perfect game, but hackers & Overkill have messed with it quite a lot over the years.

Constant back and forth between ""focus on loud"" and ""focus on stealth"" has left it messy and unclear.

Plus with PAYDAY 3 coming out, there's hardly any point in playing it other than mindless soloing."
This kinda sucks
it gets SUPER repetetive so it get boreing quickly. i would only play with friends
"This game kinda sucks, the trailers look better than the gameplay, get gta 5 instead"
Bought this to play with friends. Didn't enjoy it. Maybe if I was a teenager.
stupid
Nuh uh
"So this is a no... but actually yes. This is a nice game and quite fun BUT after updates etc a lot of weapons require you to either have linked a starbreeze account OR following the official community on steam. Now, neither of those are a problem... apart from the fact that about 70% of the time they don't register when logging into the game so your outfit is changed to the default weapons... basically it sucks."
Bullsh.t
RIP JohnWick dlc and the  bodhi character
i h8 this game
honestly kinda boring
wouldnt recommend.
Game isn't what it use 2 be....... Its like a horde simulator rather than a bank heist game. the stupid amount of swat they throw at you is off putting. idk i just know i dont enjoy the game in its current state but if you do then thats good for you and im happy for you.
"I'd like to play this game, but between internet connections to other players randomly cutting off, the game freezing/softlocking AND forgetting things like me being a community member and not loading my player correctly...it's fair to say this game isn't functioning like it's suppose to."
This Game has turned into a total ripoff. a few months ago/years ago it was a very enjoyable game but now its just pure pain and no gain. Its probably one of the worst updates in the entire gaming industry. Whoever made those decisions should be living under a bridge because they definitly do not have any kind of knowledge of wtf theyre doing. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE PAYDAY 3 IS BAD
"there""s something wrong with the item server where it wouldn't  let me use my weapons due to them having weapons mods made the community despite me following it i can just rejoin it but its a temporary fix and i would like an update that would fix it permanently but they are working payday 3 so i unfortunately  don""t see it happening anytime soon although it sometimes say""s  'unable to connect to epic server' i don""t know what to do there but that""s not the main issue that should be focused on if they do have a update fixes the item server."
"This garbage is absolute waste of your time.Its fucking ALWAYS drop u outta game, which is happening right in the middle of the fucking heist. The developers after 10y still cannot fix this fucking shit."
"game crashes every single time i try to open it. tried many things to fix and it no worky, furthest i got was the start menu like once or twice"
you cant sex :(
"I pay and play for a day, payday"
"This game is too VIOLENT, this game needs to be deleted IMMEDIATELY"
It's incredibly not fun
get help
"это пиздец, откуда столько копов, очень реалистично когда на одном ограблении приходят 1000+ копов и их всех нужно убить вчетвером"
Its fun enough but a PS3 game shouldn't take up all of my hard drive.
This game is shit. Super buggy.
"Is it fun? Yeah, as long as you play with other people. But for playing solo, this game is horrible. The teammates AI is not bad, but they can't do most of the most important things in the game (unlocking something, blowing a door, carry a frigging bag!). Which means that this game is only playable with other humans. That's not a bad thing per se. But for someone like me, who likes to play solo campaigns, this is not it.

Also, the game is infected with payed DLC, and it is a pain to even navigate the inventory. And please, get rid of the dinamic of paying everytime you want to change your suppressors, lasers and so on. It's plain stupid."
i can not understand how anyone can enjoy this. it is sooooooo boring and i dont like the aesthetic
"after all these years, devs still refuse to fix the bad fps lag and borderline unplayable cursor lag, and the only thing that helps is putting it into windowed mode, and there is no borderless windowed mode. crazy that despite how popular the game still is, they've been ignoring the community all these years."
"ikjmo,;./ 'p["
"why the fuck would one  lock main game content behind DLC i PAYED for this game and me and my friend wanted to play in the same lobby just us  but no you locked it behind DLC and you can say ""oh just do it in offline mode"" you mean that mode where you have 3 stupid bots that cant do objectives or even be used for fucking cloaker bait.

oh wait nvm i remembered this game is called ""payday"" the payday part obviously being for the devs rolling in money from the dlcs they put into the main story"
I HATE THIS GAME NIGGER
Literally crashes everytime I open it in VR
fun till it lasted
greedy bunch of cunts
"runs but then stops running like 3 seconds in with the yellow cloud with a dot thing on the game bar payday 2 has always had corruption/ just not working issues for me for years especially on ps4 i thought this would be different but i guess not i dident even get 10 hours of gameplay before it broke on me...

if anyone knows how to fix it id appreiciate it greatly"
its really good 10/1
"Mushy controls, unpolished graphics, poor clipping."
"Not the style of game for me. Wanted to like it but there's a huge difference between reading reviews and actually playing it. Unrealistic, arcade-ish feeling click fest FPS with a clunky and unintuitive UI and frenetic checkpoint goal system. The game is more smash and grab than a heist sim, which was probably what I was expecting. Reminded me of my buddies xbox game Crackdown from back in the day, never could get into that one either. 

Side point: I might be old but it's wild seeing a game that 90% of the options are off limits due to DLC."
Pretty good
Crimeboss is better
dhyfvisdbvfgsd
its fucking shit
"Its really fun till you get 10 missions in and youre about to get paid, the the game crashes."
the game used to be great but now it crashes every time I´m doing a raid safe house mission or after a heist spree honestly I can´t recommend it unless they fix those crashes 6/10
Boring and bugged game
"failed to joining room, sick of it."
I didn't really like Heat (1995) that much
absolutely horrible. get it immidiatly
"I wish this game was different, not a good heisting game at all

Just really annoying horde shooter gameplay"
"i didnt get my crime spree reawrds, bad game"
"Next to unplayable in its current state. Constantly bombarded by crashes, bugs, and a general lack of polish. I shouldn't put half an hour into a heist just to get screwed out of my rewards just because your game is held together by duct tape and string, Starbreeze. Not that y'all give half a shit about your playerbase."
"-5 star....dont buy this... noone plays it and they wouldnt refund my purchase, I have zero respect for them total waste of $ period"
I NEEEEEEED A MEDIC BAAAG
"Good game except i thought i would play payday 2 after a while only to be met with constant crashes and black screens with no solutions working.

Not only that but i discovered that most of the weapons, weapon mods, masks, gloves and other cosmetics and things are locked behind creating a nebula account.

Also creating a nebula account or following the game on steam to gain access to the locked content, doesn't even fucking work properly and you have to re-link or re-follow every single time you launch the game again. Actually insane the incompetence in this company

Another Starbreeze classic"
Pay 120+ bucks in dlcs to play the game.
Chess bots are smarter than these bots
"Fix the community items lock, and this game would be flawless."
82.5 GB of DLC I didn't pay for.
"To be perfectly honest, the over 1,000 hours are completely warranted, the game used to be good, but for example, content being locked behind the steam group (not a problem, but when I uninstall the game because it takes up 80 gb, reinstall to play it, I'm still in the group, but the content isn't unlocked.) Also so many dlcs, just wait for a sale, or just not buy the game to not satiate their greed. Lastly, the game is borderline unplayable right now (although I don't mod and it could be related to that.) As such, I cannot in good conscience recommend the game in its current state, but 2 years ago, it was in my top 10."
This games stealth sucks complete balls and makes me want to Off myself with a twelve gage shotgun
fuck
Boring and repetitive.
i hate my life
BASICALLY EVERYTHING IS LOCKED BEHIND SOME KIND OF MEMBERSHIP!
"Before i played this game, i was broke, my wife left me & and my kids left me, i got fired from my job, after i played this game, nothing changed, except the game made me more depressed.
If you like to be treated as a F2P in a paid game then play this game."
Has a british person
boring asf after 4-5h
"It's sad the state of gaming is in today's market. A game like Payday 2 which I've sunk over 1k hours into because it was so damn fun turns into shi+ just like every other cookie cutter game out there now. With how bad Payday 3's release was I'd be willing to bet there was some internal real life heist to sabotage Starbreeze and flush the company down the drain. A few updates for some more copy paste asset flip maps and some costumes that look horrible on these outdated models. I could ignore all of that however you failed to address the same bugs that have been in the game since the Overkill update and you bricked a ton of QoL mods that I cant even be bothered to hunt down anymore. Not to mention the community items are still bugged and require oh what do you know a MOD to fix. You devs are honestly an embarrassment to the community. Go find a job that suits you more.... like maybe a burger flipper? Or an IRS employee? I feel like that's more up your speed and leave this game to rot in the grave.

Until Overkill reverts update 237 and 240.3 my review will continue to be negative. Glad Payday 3 was a flop."
"The game is fun, as you can read it from other reviews but...

You need mods to fix alot of bugs and crashes.
You can't run it on max settings because it will crash on newer missions (Black Cat for example).
This game still 32 bits since the release date (august 2013), limiting the game to only 2.4 gb of usage, making it really easy to crash by running out of memory, even if you have a juggernaut PC."
Do bank robbers normally mow down thousands of police while taking very little damage?
"buggy unoptimised mess, go play drg instead"
If the developers cared then it would be manageable
I DONT LIKE THIS GAME
I dunno what happened but contracts just instantly crash my game now so I gotta reinstall the whole game on a USB and wait 12 more hours
"I used to love Payday 2. The jump in quality from Payday The Heist was monumental. The game ran fine and played well both in stealth and loud. Well only one of those things is true now. While stealth is mostly unchanged the developers in their infinite wisdom at one point decided to jack up enemy spawns to RIDICULOUS levels.

I mean this when I write it it is non-stop onslaught, like I dont think L4D has such prolonged encounters, just cops everywhere, even when you find a corner that think it's safe there are cops there. This translates to most conventional builds being useless on anything above very hard or overkill difficulty. Unless you are running a very specific and quite frankly stupid build you have no chance of trying said higher difficulties on loud. I mean there is no enjoyment in combat, no need to take cover when 5 dozers decide to tea bag you at the same time, each different variant. Whenever I do a loud heist halfway through I realise I REALLY dont want to be doing this. There simply is no fun in combat anymore.

TL;DR: The combat and gunplay in this game used to be fun but due to spawns increasing to retarded levels it is no longer so."
"Seemed to confused compare to more modern multiplayer coop, I didn't enjoy it"
Not better than payday 3
240.3 etc.
"As someone who is highly invested in FPS games, this one is a let down. The game mechanics seem cheap and nasty. Most of the game is buggy.. Don't know how there is ""Very Positive reviews"".. Everything about this game is literally garbage."
I thought it was bad at first I was wrong; EDIT i played more missions and now i cant even do any more career missions due to my game non stop crashing on multiple different missions and i got no way to fix it so i cant play the game i paid for./// So i played it for another 100 hours cuz i have dopamine issues and i still get so pissed from random fixable bullshit its difficult to play the game
"I might give this game another shot in the future, but the gameplay just isn't engaging enough for me. Plus the perk system is weird, and the game is like 85 gigs."
Hey set up the hacking device! 100 seconds Hey set up the drill! 150 seconds now set  up the thermal! 300 seconds. its just a waiting game at this point.
"Игра је убагована, длц-ови су прескупи а Гејџ курирски пакети би требали бити у основи игре а не као длц, Тешко да ћете уопште коју пљачку и обавити због болида који те избаце из партије или се не држе плана у току пљачке. једино ко хоће да се не пати да нађе друштво јер играти са странцима је тиха патња."
no way to play online. i spent an hour trying just to see nothing but errors. looks like somewhere between people saying this is better than payday 3 and now they managed to **** this one up too.
"The starbreeze account and steam group functions are broken, meaning that a bunch of items are locked and unable to be used"
it's ok. not very intruiging anymore
boring asf but alright sometimes
"KIR TO SAZANDE IN BAZI 
I LOVE YOU PMC"
Worst game ever.. seriosly who thinks spawning 300 cops a minute on 2 robbers is a good idea??? bruh then the whole heist is us shooting 300 cops a min while doing most boring ass quests.. Tell me why would anyone play this???
"Started playing in 2018 and have my fair share of hours from playing on and off, I can confidently say that while the game is very fun-- The devs are so unbelievably money hungry that it makes supporting them a chore. Base Payday 2 is a quarter of a game that can only be realized through hundreds of dollars worth of DLC. You can only play DLC content if someone else hosts it but new players are hard-handicapped because of the amazing weapons, perk-decks and attachments being gatekept by DLC. It straight up makes so many builds or guns less-optimal or unviable because you haven't shelled out more money to the company. It's a disservice to both new and returning players to need to pay so much to be on the same level as others on higher difficulties like Death Sentence. I understand that people have gone out of their way to beat the highest difficulty in the game without any DLC however, people with all the DLC have far more agency and creative freedom with guns and builds compared to the same 3-4 Hacker/Crew Chief/Ex Prez builds that you can assemble without DLC.

On the specifics of DLC, I purchased what's now known as the ""Legacy Collection"" bundle for Payday 2 back in 2018 with the promise that all future content such as heists, weapons and attachments would be added in as well upon my purchase. Now returning to the game, they scrapped that promise and funneled a bunch of new content into a separate bundle that (without a sale) costs nearly 200 fucking dollars for nowhere near as much content. I can't in good faith continue to support a company that takes advantage of it's playerbase in this way."
kill bots over and over again while waiting for a door to open simulator
Just no. Go play something else.
big chunk of content is locked behind some stupid starbreeze nebula secondary account thing that doesn't even work. Even after I did get it to work it just took my stuff back the next time I opened the game
"time to write an actual review instead of just saying its boring. so firstly there's inconsistent graphics and frames drop on the regular for no apparent reason (i've literally changed every setting possible to improve this). then we have the annoying ""hit-or-miss"" team AI where you have to get pretty lucky for them to actually help for some reason. oh yeah, lets not forget that after like 2 minutes of the heist it just disintegrates into an inspiration deficit of a ten times harder horde zombie survival game for some reason. after like 2 heists its just simply no fun anymore. :/"
Payday 3 better fr
"I waited for this game to go on sale prior to purchase. Out of all the games on my wish list, I was looking forward to this purchase more than the others. Reading all the reviews, I had a good feeling I would enjoy this game for a long time. 
So, after a long download and installation, I gave it a shot.
This game sucks!

The game ran smoothly, I was ok with older graphics due to all the positive reviews, but it was so buggy, it was like it was still in beta stage. 

The UI is shit, upgrading, purchasing weapons etc... was very confusing. The prices of weapons is retarded considering how much money you earn from jobs. 

There are way too many menus trying to figure out this and that.

Holding E to do tasks is a normal thing in games, however it has to be too precise in this game. 
For instance:
You have to cut a chain link fence to go through it. If you are too close, there is no option to press E, if you back up a bit, you are too far away to press E. You have to move forward and backward to find the sweet spot which is not enjoyable, this could have been programmed to be way easier. 

Using some items is the same way. Trying to jam a camera, the item says point at the object to use but doesn't work. 
Nothing tells you to place the jammer on the ground, this took many tries and was frustrating to figure this out. 

You are a team of 4, however you will literally be running through 100 ai swat team members to get your jobs done.
Getting shot at from all directions, and you can't kill them all, they keep coming eternally.
So, while getting shot at by 100+ swat you have to do tasks.

I know it's a game, but everything about this game is crap.

I think all the positive reviews are due to the theme of the game. Everyone gets to play a bad guy and do bad things in a game which is appealing, however, the game play is horrible. 

I am glad I only paid $2.99 for this trash. 

I miss the days when games were not over complicated and didn't take hours of watching youtube videos to figure out the most simple things."
bad game
"I've played this game for 3 hours, mostly I had spent my time on menu, and it has been a thoroughly disappointing experience. The game design is severely flawed with unlimited enemies, making it impossible to enjoy or progress. The mechanics don't make any logical sense, which just adds to the frustration.

Steam has refused to refund my purchase, which only adds to my disappointment. I strongly advise against purchasing this game. Save your time and money."
"Got to end of a heist and it kicked me out and now can't connect at all, even after rebooting my PC. So angry."
"Got this game at request of my younger cousins, thought I would see what the fuss is about

they yelled at my about in interior build, told me to spend like $80 on DLC , and overall made me feel inadequate

10/10"
"This trash game ripped off csgo, a game that was already shit. Easily one of the worst games of all time."
payday 3 is a far superior product and package and i love the way starbreeze does dlc
Este juego es mierda no lo compren
"I hate this game. And no, Payday 3's failure does not make my heart grow fonder for it, and neither should it yours. If for some reason Starbreeze find themselves in such a dire situation that they see fit resuming support for this game, which is a very real possibilty, then that will be an official indictment against your intelligence.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VF3EOBrGsq8"
"Why now as of last week of june, i cant use/equip a good chunk of my weapons/modifications if you dont have som fucking starbreeze nebula acc???? when i last plaid this back in 2021 or so, i had all my stuff and mods. NOW i gotta do som fucking acc or ""join the steam group"".... *i am but i have to re-join if i want the game to let me use them all*"
L
11 years of development for nothing
"A thousand times better than payday 3 but crime boss rockay city the AI is better and better game in general and is not that buggy 

In Payday 2 the AI companions are pretty much useless and they dont go to the van or helicopter to put the bags like crime boss, also a lot of very annoying bugs like scarface mansion about cut the wire doesn't cut, or hotline miami, is you put the wrong barcode you are stuck and needs to restart from scratch and is very frustrating because is time consuming, and john wick is broken due to how the physics are broken, hence mods are mandatory for fixes and yes the mod fixed all of this issues.

Should be called bugs days 2 because there are missions that use a saw and there are impossible to be completed because you cannot remove them without mods, so basically this game is way to buggy compare to fallout 3, new vegas and 4 and skyrim combine, is even worse than cybertrash 2077, I will give it 5 of 10 due to be fun but very buggy and extremely frustrating, the only way to play is with mandatory mods to stop crashes, also there are 4 mandatory stealth missions that I refuse to do which are: Breakin’ Feds, Car Shop, The Yacht Heist and MurkyWater Station, what a terrible idea."

"if you're buying this for the vr mode, don't"
Good Game But Bad Optimization And Alot Of Weapon Locked By Dlc
no sex update
"I like the aesthetic as it’s main foundation, I really didn’t like the endless horde of police as I found it cheesy or cartoony as the bodies piled over each other with constant reloading everywhere, including the soundtrack I had to turn off. It’s feels as if its for ADHD. I didn’t mind it the only redeeming quality was the atmosphere of the game"
"Game was killed with previous updates, it's unstable and freeze forcing you to reboot PC."
Leaving a negative review because of someone on the internet.
cop ai bad
"Not anymore. Was once an amazing game and cool company...but they threw it all away like every other major gaming corp for an unfinished ""new"" game. Leaving this one to rot with frequent crashes and freezes."
Buggy on Linux
even though i spent no money on this purchase i feel scammed
Absolute trash game just rippid of money from you
This game doggy doggy why we gotta shoot cops? I love cops and everything they do. The news is lying to U.
Почему деньги с ограбления не приходят на сбербанк?
very fun but a lot of guns and heists are locked behind DLC
most guns are locked behind dlc
"I had many hours of fun with this game, then I took a break. Upon my return I found gear I had previously earned now locked unless I create some third party account or join a community. I just wanted to play a game I paid for, using gear I already earned, but they just couldn't leave it alone."
"what have i become...... i got my entertainment


but at what cost"
One of the worst fucking games i played it made rage so much for the past 2 years that i have been playin this shit game if you want to keep your mental stability DONT PLAY THIS GAME
Terrible game....
"A shame they had to make it so you have to create a starbreeze account to access community weapons, payday 3 ruined y'all. ):"
okay game that gets extremely repetitive VERY quickly.
"I started Payday 2 in 2015, almost a decade ago now. Back then, Payday was like nothing I'd ever played before. I remember the hype I felt seeing new DLC, the enthusiasm I lent towards playing every spare moment I had - for me, Payday 2 was this amazing, perfect monolith. I had so much fun, and for a long time, that was enough. Hotline Miami, Shadow Raid, Rats... Even to this day, they hold up well and were a blast to play through again, even after all this time. I've still got plenty of fond memories, and I hoped it'd stay in my favorites forever.

Unfortunately, time saw to changing that.

Safes - the microtransactions in an already monetarily greedy game, and directly against the developer saying they'd never be added (do not ever forget what he said to the backlash, if you dont know, go and read some negative reviews here). The introduction of Locke (the strangest, most questionable contract broker by far. Why is this man speaking in south african slang in a british accent with no explanation as to what any of this means? His cadence is irritating, and i dont believe his character or its conveyance. If i could mute him and only him, i would do so gladly), the continuous worsening of heists and managing to fail on some of the best concepts (how did you make *raiding the white house* lackluster?? No additional loot? A tiny heist with an ending to a strange and oddly fantastical story? Its hard to swallow, and i was a long time fan), and more recently, the EOS ruining online play, the broken enemy spawning creating skulldozers on bloody four stores mayhem, and the fact that some heists are *still* unoptimized years after release. Payday 2 has some great concepts, held back constantly by things that I wish would change. But they won't.

Now that the game is finished, finally complete, I can say that while I had a lot of fun - Starbreeze, formerly Overkill, has demonstrated time and time again that they won't do what they need to do, unless they can find a way to take money from you. As much as it's painful for me to say, and as much as I loved it back in the day. I cannot in good concience recommend this game. I had some good times, very good times, but this is not a studio, or a developer, that deserves your money. Save it. Find something else to ignite your passion.

Try Monaco. That's the best advice I can give you. If you decide to play, I hope the game's limitations and poor choices don't sour the fun you might otherwise have. I wish that It hadn't for me."
Bad game ngl
"Kinda a bit jank, spammed mtx and micro dlcs"
"This game used to be fun, but now it's in a state of neglect. Simply the act of inviting someone to your party, or joining a friend's game was an impossible task. Not to mention a truly toxic community that will kick constantly. Not worth it. It seems they have removed basic functionality to spur people to buying Payday 3. Not worth."
Not worth it.

dont work
"I now cant use community weapons, even though i have linked my starbreeze account so is not worth playing anymore"
ASS game qq
"A very fun game ruined ruined by corporate greed.  I've had a lot of fun playing this game over the years but now content that I'd earned/unlocked is held hostage by Overkill wanting us to sign up for a Starbreeze account.  Allegedly, one can follow the official Payday 2 steam community to regain access but it has never work for me.  Payday 3 was dead on arrival so I guess it's Payday 2's turn.  Goodbye Payday 2."
repetative and bad gameplay
"DLC here, DLC there, DLC everywhere!"
Longest uninstall of my god damn life. Unbelievable. Can't possibly be my shit computer.
no more updates :<
Overrated.
"If you have a lot of money stored for DLC, this is 100% one of the games you'll want. If not, have fun using some of the lamest and most stereotypical FPS weapons in the game. Other than that, It needs a bit of love from the devs, but this is a solid game in the Payday franchise."
the hardest part of this game is not crashing
"Honestly, it's pretty boring. The missions are repetitive. A huge amount of content is locked behind paid DLCs, which is understandable, but it annoys me greatly that I cannot attach a sight to a pistol without paying for it. The graphics and gun-play are fine, but the game shows its age via clunky controls and bugs. Overall, if you aren't ready to spend additional money, it's not worth buying, even on a sale."
I can't go more than 10 minutes without crashing what the hell
Just not a fan of the company. All their games leave a bad taste in my mouth now and I can no longer play them.
aight
Breaking feds is the worst gaming experience i have ever had.
cannot play with my friend thats on epic games
"Ever since update 237, Payday 2 has become literally unplayable if you have so much as a single mod installed, and by unplayable I mean the game physically will not launch if you have mods, thanks Epic, you ruined yet another otherwise good game."
La de da de da its the mother fucking dee oh double jhee snoop dogg This dude act like a baby
i refunded this game for payday the heist
i love having content i already unlocked randomly restricted behind making an unnecessary account
meiqawhdfa
Starbreeze is being a greedy bitch
"TLDR
REMOVE THE F****NG LINK TO NEBULA ACCOUNT. My weapons are disabled

I have played this game for quite a while, and I love it. Bought the Ultimate Edition back in the day. Everything is great. The music is suuuuuper. Great game, I recommend it to everyone who likes fast paced action and great stealth. 

BUUUUTT, I have stopped playing it for a while, and downloaded it, and to my surprise most of my weapons are locked and require the connection to Nebula acc or being in the community. I joined the community and linked my account to stupid Nebula, but still the weapons are locked"
"326$ worth of DLCs 

run fast loot fast leave :()"
It crashes every 2 hours making me lose all of my cook off progress
"too many dlcs that paywall everything o thedr than that very good

hey chefg, i know youre reading this. dont loojk behind you."
"Childhood is when you idolize high levels.
Adulthood is when you realize that playing with no skills is inherently more fun.

In all seriousness, fuck this game's progression. The way it handles weapon customization, too."
"Stealth is painful.

Feel free to tell me how stealth can be done. I tried for almost an hour and wanted to tear my skin off."
im paying for a day
ITS GOOD BUT NOT GOOOD FIX THE FUCKING CRASHING PROBLEM YOU STUPID BITCHES NOW PLEASE OR I WILL HURT YOU MYSELF AND BOMB YOUR STUDIO NOW
"not even Beamng.drive features this many crashes

- and not collision ones!"
🖕fuck🖕epic🖕games🖕
mfw locking content i already own and use behind making an account
"Used to be a smashing game to spend hours on for fun co-op. 
Both high action and stealth worked quite well, which was a surprising balance of the opposite playstyles.
Ridiculous amount of DLCs sold separately, but luckily only the host needs to own the content.
 
Now it crashes quite frequently, rendering it unplayable. It isn't even always my game crashing, so we play a russian roulette on who will drop out first and at which point it will eventually be the host.
Especially on the newer maps the crash rate is more frequent. 


Used to have native support for Linux with absolutely no issues and flawless gameplay.
After servers were sold to Epic, only Proton compability is possible and surprising performance issues were introduced. Epic is known to be openly hostile when it comes to Linux, so no surprise there."
Game broke down after it was sold for epic. Now it's completely unplayable because it crashes frequently. My friends have same problem so my PC cant be faulty.
Cant connect with friends like you used too.
Can't connect with friends online without crashing at some point in the lobby. Same IP users can't play with each other. They screwed this game up. Don't Buy.
"Playing on steam deck works great, however you have to Join the community group or create a nebula account to use a Majority of items. You would think doing either would solve this issue however I have both a Linked Nebula Account and Im following the community and Im still not allowed to use these items. In order to fix this issue I have to stop following the group and follow it through the in game link to the community Every single time I open the game. The nebula account system is just broken. All in all a good game ruined by Bugs that shouldnt even exist in the first place. Still better than Payday3."
the game is very good and i love it but they fucking ruined it with community weapons that lock me out of using guns and attachments that i had already bought REMOVE COMMUNITY ITEMS and this will be the easiest thumbs up since Helldivers 2
"I'm done with this game.

• Stealth is just broken, not in a good way, just in a ""this game was never meant to have it but we did anyway"" way.

• Police assault never ends, cops just never stop spawning by the dozen, even if the ""assault wave"" text isn't present and the music is calm.

• XP and money making is excessively grindy unless you play on ""ultra hard insta death fuck you"" mode. It pisses me off when, even following advice I just can't get shit done on harder modes, I just feel like my version of the game specifically hates me or something.

• Your weapons feel useless, wether by chewing through a shallow pool of ammo too damn fast or by just never dealing enough damage to kill things fast enough."
"While the game itself is very good, overkill is essentially using a massive money grubber just to play most of the game. If you actually want the dlcs at a decent price, buy them off of CDkeys.com or Fanatical."
"Can you guys stop focusing on payday 3 (game that's been dead on release) and fix the only game that you guys managed to salvage and keep together? Fix the community weapons issue, come on. (Also the game is failing to launch as well, this game just keeps getting better)"

mostly dlcs
This game is wasted potential while yes it can be fun but the difficulty jump from death wish to death sentence isnt even funny the overkill team were smoking some good weed when balancing death sentence because the basic enemies go from weak f tier cops to being stronger that a shotgun bulldozer up close on death wish but the game balances it out by dropping the most brain dead weapons that turn every difficulty except death sentence into a point and click adventure but locking them behind dlc which i do not recommend buying just pirate it since that is the only thing that marks a player a cheater and not actual hacks the game has amazing features and fun ideas but sometimes it implements them so badly it makes the whole expierience very terrible
why do I now need to make a starbreeze account or join a community group to put on my smiley mask I've owned the whole time? disgusting
"Literally unplayable. The framerates are bad, stuttery and always below 100 but if look up i get 300+ why? IDK

"The biggest heist in this game is Starbreeze trying to come up with a new money making scheme by selling consumer data with the LOCKING OF VARIOUS EQUIPMENT/CONTENT I'VE USED FOR GIVE OR TAKE 10 YEARS!!! 
You guys ruined the new game so it wasn't good enough you came back for the golden child?!? I've played this forever and never had an issue with using my akimbo pistols or judge until this new greedy non-sense your suits pushed through."
"I do not recommend this game because it has a sky high rate of bugs, constant crashing, and the ai often getting stuck and the enemies on spawning in are either bugged and stuck in a corner, crouch walking, or full speed running for no reason. The detection system is also broken to the point where you shoot your weapon sometimes nobody would detect it and sometimes 1 or 2 guards or civs would detect it making the game a buggy and janky mess. Just speaking from my experiences in the game."
"heists take way too long (30 mins for one heist) and u can die in the last 10 seconds and have to do it all over again, make heists shorter plz"
The game frequently disconnects
"took my items and put them behind some stupid group content lock, first they took my golden spoon and made me buy it with real money now this? they really want to ruin this game just to make payday 3 look good, keep it up you're doing a good job, if you want more tips ask the DBD devs they are masters at ruining their own game"

"This game has potential. I would even go so far as to say it's occasionally entertaining. But it is a terribly optimized buggy mess, with gameplay was never thought through well.

+ Unique, funny, and with lots of character

- Nonsense puzzles where the solution had absolutely no hints whatsoever that could plausibly lead someone to figure them out
- Inconsistent, unpredictable detection system
- Gameplay that is frequently boring or repetitive, including parts where you literally just sit and wait for up to three minutes and nothing happens
- [strike]Need to use 760p resolution and minimum graphics on a modern computer. I still get fifteen frames. This game is ten fucking years old.[/strike] (EDIT: this turned out to be my fault. My GPU was improperly seated. I did not bother to reinstall the game to check if it runs well now.)
- Terrible art and animation quality

I wrote the above two days ago. I'm still playing the game though. Maybe, if you think you can look past the negatives, you'll enjoy it. That one positive is [i]very[/i] strong one."

"I've got banned from PayDay 2 official Discord server for looking for 🏳️‍🌈 LGBTQIA+ friendly people to play with.

"I suppose that security has sort of wallhacks, cuz he can detect me through wall and because of that my perfect heists getting ruined and 100+ EUR for more heists and guns? No way lmao, you cant even fix multiplayer servers for your new payday game."
"It has so many DLCs that they cost about 10 times the price of the game. They also promised in the past there will never be any microtransactions, then they proceeded to add the most cancerous version of it, loot boxes. So they added gambling to the game.

At some point they announced they are done milking and sold a so called complete version of the game, then they came back and started milking again.

I don't care who they are blaming, if it was the publisher or whatever. I'm a customer and the customers got screwed regardless."

I force hostage to follow me no matter how much i called them even thought im in a big clear room they're still dont follow me.
Im giving this game a bad review because the devs screwed up payday 3 so bad that it made me hate this game too. Thanks obama
"I don't see why this game is so beloved and maybe it's the community's fault. I was pressured into buying this game because my friends wanted me to play it. Instead of playing the game naturally like a normal person I was dragged through missions way out of my league so they could grind my levels higher then I could progress on my own at the time. It was horrible, I don't care if the late game content is just that much better that is not how you introduce someone to a game. When I tried this game again years later, nothing clicked and I refuse to play it again. If you do genuinely want to try the game, take it at your own pace. If your the type of friend that would force your friend through the 8 hours of torture I went through, you're a bad friend. But apparently, dragging your friends though a grind like that to rapidly level them is normal in this community which is awful."
The most unrealistic game in the world. Overrated af
"Payday 2 is a highly entertaining and well-designed game with a significant amount of depth that comes from its longevity over close on 11 years since release. The huge number of maps, weapons, characters, etc. should provide something for everyone and the ability to go loud or play in stealth on many maps is a great feature. For the past six weeks I've played this exclusively (having acquired it when it was given away on Steam a while back) and generally had a blast doing it (obviously like any online game there is an element of idiotic/toxic players).

The thumbs are down because it is hopelessly unreliable. Connections to other players drop frequently, meaning you lose rewards and potential achievements. Even worse, when hosting my own crime spree I failed yesterday due to a bug that is documented on Steam/Reddit close to 10 years ago on one map and today due to a crash, which occur with alarming regularity. Suggesting I pay a heap of in-game currency to continue said crime spree due to an 'unexpected closure' is simply not acceptable. The utter lack of respect from the developers for their players' time for a game that regularly tops 25,000 concurrent players (roughly 100 times more than its apparently failed sequel) is a joke. 

Given there is (presumably) still a significant potential revenue stream in terms of DLC, I can only suggest some resource is focused on addressing the copious number of bugs and engine issues that are well documented online that have clearly gone unaddressed over the impressively long time this game has been a hit."
Fucking Game. Don't Weast Your Money. Don't Trust On Positive Reviews.
"Fucking Game, Don't Weast your money."
to many black
cant play
fun
"This game comparing to payday the heist fuckin sucks lol.

From charming indie l4d clone, second game turned to nothing else than click enemy simulator with endless grind known from such an exquisite titles as metin 2 or other asian generic mmo. Most guns feel the same, enemies are bullet sponges, specials are not as special anymore since they are half of the law force trying to take you down. Quantity over quality at it's biggest extreme.

Do yourself a favour and get Payday: The Heist"
i spent 6 hours struggling for 3 missions THIS GAME IS FOR REAL NPC'S AND I DONT WANT TO BE ONE OF THEM
doesn't. fucking. work.
Starbreez please fix your shit man. I even made a new account and everything. restarted my pc. and you shit still wont let me have my weapons because you deiced to be a shit programmers.
"Very chaotic game. I don't expect a game to be massively realistic but this is no sense. In this game you are basically running around like a headless chicken under a rain of bullets, explosives and police running around. Quite often there is some many police that you just walk throw them rather than shooting them. Also they spam from everywhere... they even abseil down from the sky in the middle of the road.
I love shooting games and I remember Payday 1 to be quite good but also crazy.
Good story, good music, good graphics but playability is shit."
не играйте в это в 2024+ году
"Absolute junk UI, they make it almost impossible to get into a private coop game, you have to add a startup command to connect to steam servers for the invite button to even be there, then filter out specific games, then the player you want to finally invite has to be showing as online, why??? some players don't like to show as online, I don't I'm always invis. Then once thats all good and done, the player (My girlfriend sat next to me on the same network) stuck on joining game, don't bother, they can't even get a simple thing like creating a game and inviting friends right, devs must be brain dead."
"Got stuck in a modder's lobby, epic"
"no driving. you can just run past cops and swat, no collision boxes or something. not immersive. I will try again on a harder difficulty but so far cant recommend. also why does the drill break so often?"
poorly optimized ran about 30 fps constant on lowest settings with a pc 10x more powerful than the recommended sepcs
not HOTLINE MIAMI
"I used to love this game.  I put idk how many hours into it on console before swapping to PC. 
Coming back was a lot of fun, but it seems like the game is just destabilizing after the launch of Payday 3
Issues with community items, multiple crashes in a night, not to mention the game's glaring issues that have been around since day one.  Considering that I can't even launch Payday 3 (that disaster is its own nightmare) and the only definitive Payday experience is fracturing at the seams, I don't have high hopes for Starbreeze anymore.   Please Devs, optimize Payday 2, fix Payday 3, do SOMETHING to put the soul back into your franchise"
"$10 USD game. Over $250 USD for the rest of the game. Outside of pricing though, it's pretty good."
This game is SOOOO BAD. I do not understand why it is so popular. It is just cheap garbage.
"Hadn't played payday 2 in almost a year come back No John Wick, nearly everything requires a StarBreeze Account, about half the free content is locked or pay and the other half is just simply No Access... 2022 Payday 2 is a solid 9/10 2024 payday is a 1/10 and thats being generous... game plays like its owned by ea pay for everything and whats not pay needs an account. Think imma remove payday from my account as it has become nearly as bad as PayDay 3."
"If you are planning to play this game with friends, don't. We can't play a full game without at least one person crashing and failing to rejoin because the game simply doesn't work. Yes, we also tried anticrash mods to fix these issues, but the result is the same. Fiddling with the options menu doesn't change anything too. How this game went on for 10 years with a playerbase is insane to me.

And I'm not even mentioning the billion DLCs and all the connection problems that Starbreeze has, which you need to make an account on if you want to play with a good chunk of weapons and cosmetics."
"Do not buy this if you are going to play this with a friend that got the game from epic games.

Devs completely ruined the crossplay. Steam uses its invite system while epic games uses codes to join."
"I thought I like this game, 
until they broke the community authentication, 
that I realize I only like the furry mods.

haha Luna model goes brrrrrr"
payday is decent but this is trash and i bet the same is for payday 3
"Constant crashing. Still fun, though."
"Used to be a great game, then about a year ago, they merged their servers with Epic Games, and it completely broke the game. At first it was completely unplayable, but now that nearly a year has passed, it has slightly improved. You can still expect abnormally long loading times, unstable servers, random crashes, and the way the game registers what items you have is completely broken. It would be an amazing game if they just fixed their servers."
THIS GAME IS POOP I vastly prefer payday 3 suck it redditors
"doggy doo doesnt even explain what you are supposed to do after you pick up the presents wonky repetitive boring combat with below average graphics refunded after 5 minutes, cant believe such a cluster fk of a game has a huge fan base i guess people buy anything. to top it all off they wont refund this sh1t never buy from this company ever again."
bad review for using deep shiver in 3
This shit's pay to win
booooooooooooring
starbreeze please fix your ♥♥♥♥. i don't want to have to rejoin the community every time i restart my computer.
"Starbreeze/Overkill try to develop functional, optimized video-games challenge (IMPOSSIBLE)"
I get yall have payday 3 now but at least fix the annoying bug.
"this game is more depressing than wanking alone, it fucking sucks hope they never make a paygay 3"
"What's this?
Join Payday 2 community or link Starbreeze account to unlock map and weapon
I already join 10 times and it didn't received anything

God darn fix it or let Overkill handle it right now, Starbreeze"
I have to fix wrong rating go down lower to mixed thank you
"Abandoned with game breaking bugs, stay clear!

They are probably trying to get us to buy the new game, but nuts to that when they can't support their existing games."
What an utter piece of shit Starbreeze. An old game from 2013 that crashes every 30 mins fyou Starbreeze
fix starbreeze
"starbreeze please fix your shit. i don't want to have to rejoin the community every time i restart my computer.

edit: for the time being, you can use a mod to fix this since starbreeze is busy fucking around with their shitty third game https://modworkshop.net/mod/47476"
couldnt save private pyle....
Dont get this game get brazzers instead
"Requires you to join stupid steam group to use attachments for your guns. Also 600 DLCs.
Overall okey-ish game"

"don't buy this game, you will get stuck in an infinite loop between installing and uninstalling"
crashes constantly
"Was fun in the past, now broken. Can't play online, can't use items I had in the past because of the move to Epic/Starbreeze. Pathetic."
Game is terrible bad.I played 2 PAYDAY games and I think this game worse than PAYDAY 1.
ويعععععععععععععععع
"Totally gone sideways, been playing for years and now everything's jammed up cant use my HE grenades or access equipment i won in years past. Totally PISSED OFF"
fix starbreeze
not giving a positive review until they steal the valve at valve
freeze and glitch 50\50
Bring back scarface character pack
terrible
"Extremely grindy, DLC-locked progression, 7 thousand guns that are aren't that much different gameplay wise from each other, and most of them - you guessed right - locked behind DLCs.
It's an overmarketed game with an extremely hostile marketing scheme.
It has some quirks to it - the humour is fun, the easter egss - interesting, but the grindy nature of the game kills all enjoyment that i could ever get from it

Go play Deep Rock Galactic, it's literally this game, but better in every aspect, made by people with actual love for their product and community and not letting their greed ruin something that could otherwise be really fun."
Game still randomly crashes after 10 years of development. All I wanted to do was commit mass genocide on feds and now I'm playing Tetris with my Task manager just to try and close the game.
To much bugs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I just didn't like this game. Give it a try but no
if you dont have friend dont play this game

"[b]PURCHASE GOOD REVIEW: 253,23 €/$/£*[/b]

Game sampah
Too much of a rail game. Too much shooting. More spray than twitch.
"I bought this game last week and until now I didn't know that you need to join the fucking community group to get a fucking granade. Like wtf this is some mental bullshit. Im so mad about that like come on!!!
P.S. I love shooting cops while the soundtrack is playing in my hears, also Im on coke everyday while playing this game"
Hell
"I love it when the game crashes for half of my team and resets their save progress, that i am unable to equip the gear i just unlocked, the fact that the stealth in this game is ass, and the list goes on...

And people complained about PAYDAY3 not being playable, as if this game was any good to begin with, you play a heist and you are having a great time with your friends, while the next one will make want to uninstall the fucking game right after.

Go buy the 120+ euro ""DLC"" type of approach from the developers... Honestly this game feels like eating a 6.5/10 meal and then being shitted on the face for hours."
"Bad game, cringe missions, everything is paid dlc.
Save yourself, go play some indie game that is 10 x the fun and 1/10 the price"

good game though"
the game was fun and everything till last mission the white house it kept crashing and when i thought i find a solve for it and played the heist in stealth and i was about to escape it crashed again i hope the developers get alot bugs and problem in their next game to understand how i felt....
en la switch iba mejor esto
"Bought it to play with my friend, however we cannot even join each other. The online is bugged. Normally you can simply shift-tab and click on the name to invite them. For whatever reason pay day 2 does not do that and the invite system within the game does not work. Very sad that I cannot play it with my friend."
Played it once and uninstalled it. Don't be fooled by the reviews
game
this game so hard
I don't like this game because of someone that forced me to play it
Literally just stand and shoot the cops as they spawn
waste of money

"+++ I Play in VR only so this review is about PayDay2 with the official VR DLC +++

Although it's an old game (2013) the multiplayer part is nicely done, that's why I play it so much.
That said, that's about the only positive thing I can say about it...
There are so many things in the game that could have been done better, but if you know the story behind it (tip; google on 'the fall of Starbreeze) you know it's been a hasty and therefore **** job, to bad because it could have been much much better, but with the release of the even worse PayDay 3 my guess is there won't be any updates for PD2 anymore and this is it.
Then specifically the VR DLC , knowing that Starbreeze bought about every VR company they could get their hands on it's really about the worst you could imagine, it lacks basic functions like jumping, so there are levels that you can't play because they require you to jump....
You can't chat in game, only between games so there's an absolute lack of communication, the movement is clumsy, the only way to improve this is by installing mods and then you cannot play in the online multiplayer games.
Then is there the skills and perks decks, skills can't be made totally full because there's a limit on the so called XP points you can acquire but the perk decks can be made full (but only use 1 at a time) and your perk points keep flowing in for no reason.
There's a astonishing amount of achievements to be made, most of which give the same wins, cash money and some weapon mods, or different masks and items that don't help anything to the poorly made choices made earlier by the devs.... 
It can be very unstable but that can also be because of Steamlink that's unusable after the 'quality of life' update, or Steam VR for the same reason, or the Oculus link, or PayDay 2 itself that crashes, believe me, about a third of the time spend in the game I haven't been able to finish a round because of crashes, lost connection or any other malfunction that can occur forcing you to restart either PayDay 2 or Steam or your headset....
All in all, buy it when it's on sale for like 9.99 and you can have some fun, but if you're a avid VR gamer and used to the astonishing quality of Alyx, this is an absolute disappointment."
"game goes hard when i buy the ""80"" different dlc's"
bad
it's not like the candy bar
One-Armed Robber is better and free
doesn't want to launch anymore on my pc in 2024. support didn't help me
"This publisher (Overkill / Starbreeze) effectively stole over $150million USD of consumer money. Payday 3 was dead on arrival, and is still functionally unplayable at this time (over a year after its release).

Overkill has continued to work on cosmetics rather than fix the millions of issues being reported. The devs have lied to their fans and squandered any goodwill that may have existed in the playerbase. Almir is straight up a con man and should be fired along with the executive suite of Overkill.

I have blocked the publisher and the dev team on my steam acount. What a fucking dumpster fire."
Game crashes every half hour now. Total coincidence that no one is playing the new one.
payday $$$
dont buy it for the VR
trash
Just boring and not very fun.
not enough content imo
"VR로 플레이 할 생각에 구입함.

우선 vr하고는 궁합이 정말 안 맞음.
최적화도 너무 안 좋아서 계단현상이 정말 심함. 어느정도냐면 조준을 해도 구분이 안갈정도.
그렇다고 옵션 올리자니 프레임드랍이랑 레이턴시가 엄청 끊겨서 이도저도 아닌 딜레마를 겪을거임.

그리고 당연한 얘기지만 pc버전을 그냥 vr로 포팅한 수준이라 조작감이 개판임.
내 시선과 움직이는 방향이 따로 놀아서 움직임부터 꽉막힌 느낌이라 길 찾는 것만해도 답답해 미칠지경

건플레이는 진짜 너무나 실망 그 자체임.
재장전도 쌩뚱맞게 그립버튼으로 하지않나 심지어 새 탄창 꺼내는데 5초 카운트다운을 기다려야함ㅋㅋㅋ
VR FPS 좋아하는 사람들은 건스톡도 가지고 있을 건데 이건 건스톡을 사용하면 총구가 땅으로 조준이 되서
그냥 컨트롤러로만 조준해야할 정도로 건스톡은 무용지물임. 온워드나 파블로프처럼 건스톡 보정 따위 없음.

돈독 오른 오버킬이라고 이러나 저러나 말 많았는데
결국 유행에 반짝 편승해서 VR포팅으로 돈벌려고 이식한 수준임.
심지어 다른 vr 포팅 게임들과 비교하면 그 게임들한테 실례 될 정도로 훨씬 못미치는 퀄리티를 가지고 있음.

그냥 PC판으로 플레이하는걸 추천함.
VR버전은 실망만 가득하고 구색 맞추기도 못한 느낌임.
심지어 vr이라는 특성이 있는데도 하이스트라는 장르에서 건플레이 마저 못챙겼으니 말 다한거임.

솔직히? 그 말 많던 메달오브아너 VR이 퀄리티도 그렇고 훨씬 재밌었음."
I CAN'T EVEN PLAY THE GAME ANYMORE !!!!!!!!
i hate this game
Overmonitized
"Grind simulator that despite of popular opinion didn't age well. Skill tree is broken, gameplay is repetitive, gunfights is boring, lore is unhinged yet irrelevant, cheaters don't get banned, random disconnects for no reason, random crashes for no reason, and mods... I found it funny that the better and usefull mod- the higher chance that it will crash the game.

PS: I decided to give a try after a while and oh God, after Payday 3 Payday 2 graphics feels like PlayStation MINUS One"
.
"Don't... just don't, please, save yourself"
"This game is just not worth it to play in 2024. It just a frickin dead ahh game, the server is really suck, the heist some of em were good and some of em were just straight dogshit, i must say with humble face, that this game is just mediocre."
This is not it
"And then god said; LET THERE BE MID

still fun at moments tbh, I'd give it a neutral review if I could"
"Bought the game to play stealth, and was very disappointed. You can't even take off your mask once you put it on, don't know what the devs were thinking. Roblox knock-offs are more fun than this."
Too much dlc
"Once a good game, now a broken disaster with devs that clearly wiped their аsses with the legacy Payday series had, countless balance and optimization issues, worst design and artstyle choices, awful amount of DLCs locking most of the content behind the wall, this game feels like a corpse that begs to be murdered because how much it suffered over the course of 10 years. Game was one of it's kind and it felt awesome, but since 2015 game turned into a horde shooter with tons of enemies even on the lower difficulty levels, some of the heists in the game are horrendous disgrace (Heat Street for example that got turned into literal Easy Street or some post-2018 Locke heists), people who still play this game in it's current state are either mentally sick or just can't let give up the butchered stinking corpse because they've had some fun before with it when it was kicking alive."
"For the most part, this game's not too bad. If you can get by the many Glitches and bugs that are in this crap. Every time trying to start a mission, it always comes up as error most of the time.  Get used to seeing the word error you'll see it a lot when you're trying to jump in with other people. And it's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen. Even playing the game, you get halfway through it or towards the end of it and you lose connection to the host. This is the most irritating thing I've ever had to play next to division 2. I could not even recommend this game to nobody."
Do NOT waste your time or money on this husk of a company
"Cheaters, trolls game only. Unless you play only in your own lobbies and few mods that will help you kick people that cheats before they get the chance of joining your game."
You can't get all the mask and you doing same stuff over and over. Are better games out there in 2024.
Just didnt do it for me
"Had this in my library for years but never got around to playing it. It's bad lol. It's reminds me of like an old PS2 game. The missions make no sense. The stealth is terrible. The AI is weird. It's unrealistic. Like you'll instantly have 50 officers spawn within a minute of someone alerting them lmfao. Oh please, IRL, you'll be lucky to have 1 officer respond within 10 minutes lol. On top of that, if you're invading a criminal organization, why would criminals alert the police? That makes zero sense. And, as I mentioned, the missions make no sense. Like on one of the missions, you have to use a crow to jam a small fan. So you have to go around the facility finding crow bars when you could realistic just shoot the fans or stick anything in them to achieve the same thing. Or you'd think that if the heist was well planned you'd have some tool to do this instead of finding random crow bars that happen to conveniently be laying around."
"At first, yes, I enjoyed Payday 2; however, being the sour sod I am I have some trust issues when it comes to online co-operation parts of certain games (with good reason) so all I have played was this game solo. While the game boasts a singleplayer ability, the game does not hold any punches when you are alone. I have played for about 41 hours and I stopped because I kept losing missions and ended up having to just admit defeat that I am not a good enough player to play solo. That and the fact that there are so many DLC's for the game. I own 36 DLC's and that is not even half of what is on the list. It is not a recommendation from me.

dripcik dripcik flexsova money money
This review is paid DLC. Please purchase to read.
the game is fun but there is way to much dlc and it is way to expensive so you cant play with what you want sooooooo
Did not enjoy this one. Tutorial was a mess and I couldn't stand it past that
"I would only recommend this for people who look forward to grinding 3 hours a day to finally get the things they want, and (me personally) the only way you can understand the heists (in stealth) is by looking up a youtube video or by reading the 10 page essay on the pre-planning section. I like payday 2, and I have heard that payday 3 is not a good experience, so I doubt I will get it, and the only reason why I got the game was because it was on sale for less than a dollar, so I picked it up on the winder sale thingy. Also, having to get 69000 dlcs just to play the full game is pretty sad, it would be fine if they combined all of the dlcs into like 7,  like the ""cosmetics"" dlc, containing ALL cosmetic items, the ""Weapons & Mods"" containing all DLC weapons and modifications for weapons, and then the heist dlcs containing all heist dlcs. I just compressed 79 (yes, payday 2 has AROUND 79 dlcs) dlcs into 3."
"The game is hot garbage, and it has DLCs and microtransactions. 
Enjoy. I won't! :D"
"If people were smart enough to set up private servers and disconnects weren't happening when joining heists, maybe this game would be good, playable game with randoms and friends. Other than that, it's a good heist game despite the messed up lore. Gameplay and mechanics similar to my favorite heist movie and I absolutely dig it.

EditL It got worse where my Nebula account will claim to be disconnected and lock my guns away. After the months-old issue has been fixed, it has since happened again. Safe to say, I'm tired of seeing this happen again."
no
"This game feels like a mobile game. Its so scuffed and feels like one guy in their mothers bastement made this game. Not worth 11 bucks. I bought during Winter sales where it was 2 bucks for the game, not worth 2 dollars. This game is only worth it if its free, but not for even a dollar. Terrible game"
it was a pretty good game but now is really a dead game because of starbreeze requirements ...

Dumb
"Man, I used to have a blast with this game. But when it jumped ship to the Epic Store, it felt like everything went haywire. The whole Steam vs. Epic showdown turned the community upside down, and the game was a horrible mess.
I'm talking basic stuff not working, crashes left and right, and FPS going on a rollercoaster ride. It got so bad that a bunch of us, old-timers and noobs alike, decided to call it quits. It felt like the devs were just shrugging it off, and we were supposed to just deal with it.
Fast forward almost a year, I'm thinking, ""Okay, maybe things have settled down."" Fired up the game, and what do I get? The good ol' freeze on ""press any button."" Turns out loads of others are stuck in the same boat, blaming it on yet another funky update.
This game used to be a blast with friends, but it's like the devs are simply not caring anymore. All these good vibes turned sour, especially with how Payday 3 had one of the worst game releases of all time. Not to say, borderline scam. 
I had hope for a comeback, but let's face it – it's feeling like déjà vu, and the devs seem content letting this ship sink."
Fuck payday 2 & bain I thought this game would be fun but it's not it's too hard and if you shoot civilians bain would go off & say you should be put away for live & it seems that he is more of police then payday gangster. I want my money back this game sucks especially bain.
It's poo
"mouse not working lol, all the support is ""eeh turn of your uplay"".. never used it btw"
THIS GAME IS SO F*CKING SUCKS!!!
mindless shooting and the occasional animation
Terrible game
Im gonna goon
Not my sort of game sorry pal
"It's fun with friends, stealth is broken but accomplishing when you manage to do it, the characters are cool, storyline is weird and makes no sense, gunplay is fun once you figure out what's for you, and all-in-all, it's a great game.

So why am I saying no? The most recent update has (Allegedly on purpose) broke the game, tenfold as many enemies are spawning making even normal difficulty frustrating, the AI can now shoot you through walls and cover, without even looking at you, snipers and shields down you in one hit regardless of builds or armor, hell, sometimes nobody is even near you and you'll just randomly go down, crashes are more frequent, friends get kicked from servers constantly due to Overkill's incredibly smart decision to swap the servers over to Epic Store, word on the street is the devs have done this on purpose to force people to go play Payday 3 (A disappointing unfinished live service pile of poo), given what an absolute clown Almir Listo is, this wouldn't surprise me. Regardless if this is true or not, DO NOT BUY THE GAME IN IT'S CURRENT STATE."
this game is too difficult to play with friends. All the options are difficult and not user friendly
The game multiplayer is shit. Ican`t play with friends!
"After the major fkup that PayDay 3 was, decided to come back to PD2 and they ruined this game after some updates where the game randomly loses connection, game freezes out of nowhere forcing me to kill it via Task Manager. No crash log gets created and no one addressed the issue yet - multiple people complaining.

Great job alienating your community SBZ.
Forced me to downgrade to an earlier version to make the game function, forced to eternal single player now."
"Unfortunately the DLC and pricing policy made me avoid this game, although I had a lot of fun with various friends.
[b]Way too many DLCs for my taste[/b]
[b]Way too many achievements to enjoy it anymore[/b] [i](At the time of the review there are 1328 achievements)[/i]

Payday 3 has recently been available and has very mixed reviews so far.

According to my prediction, Payday 2 will take one of the two paths
[b](a.)[/b] abandoned
[b](b.)[/b] better than it became the past 5 years"
"balances are 50% hard counters like overwatch, the other 50% being forced builds like gunfire reborn
abysmal friendly AI like battlefield 4
absurdly unfair enemy AI like PvZ: GW2
melee focused FPS like titanfall 2
buggy and unoptimized to the point of being borderline unplayable like slime rancher 2
overly tedious abandonware like borderlands 2

and somehow this game has a larger playerbase than all of the above combined"
game concept is great but its kinda p2w bc of the dlc's. not alot of bugs and glitches (ragdolls dont count)
"What is this bullshit, my friends can't even join my lobby"
85 gigabytes
"Payday 2 is by no means a bad game or not fun to play. Every single ""level"" (called heists) is fun to play. There's a career mode that puts all of these heists in different orders, you can play with friends, you can play alone. However, there are two leading problems with the game.

1. Most heists take forever to complete.
I had to play for OVER FIFTY MINUTES ON ONE HEIST because of bad RNG and low brain cell disorder. Enough said.

2. Stealth feels very unfinished, rushed, and overall, clunky and is overall not enjoyable for me. Stealth also happens to be one of the only ways to circumvent a lot of wasted time in almost every mission that can be stealthed.

Given the reasons above, I do not believe that payday 2 deserves a recommendation from me.
However, if you have elected to buy it, play it, sink some hours into the game. You've already paid that money, might as well make use of it, amyrite?"
It's ok

I love this game but the recent changes are devastating.
The new update crashes so often
"The developers of this game are doing everything they can to kill the game off and force you to play Payday 3, an objectively unstable and uninteresting sequel. Do not buy either. The most recent patch introduced instabilities, game breaking glitches, difficulties with matchmaking, and replaced AI brains with oatmeal.

I loved this game. I miss this game."
"you better love shooting cops and lots of them with little break because that is what you will be doing 90% of the time. also get used to the bugs ranging from slightly annoying to the game killing itself. even if you don't mind any of that i would still advise against buying this game solely because of it incompetence devs. they have time and time again shown their incompetence and greediness. i want the best for this IP and it fans but not these devs, or atleast not 99% of the time. feel free to dig deeper to see or hell to laugh at my stupidity."
"Sadly I can't reccomend this game anymore, it used to be good. Then they released a shit ton of paid dlcs, then there was the update 204 and with the addition damage range falloff, the game got a lot worse. Then they released the update 237 and with that ruined matchmaking. Then they released payday 3 and it flopped, so they intentionally made payday 2 worse. And as a final nail in the coffin, the release of the update 240.3 they killed the game by making the AI stupid and overall bad. Made a lot of changes for the sake of making changes (none good btw). A great game that fell from great heights due to a stupid decision making with the developer overkill and starbreeze."
Boring
game quality is low also too many dlc
Overrated af game. I wish I could get my $1.99 back - even at this price it's too expensive.
НОРМ ИГРА
"fun game. 
connecting to co-op games is so hit-or-miss i uninstalled."
"I like the game but removing the Legacy Collection Bundle for the duration of sales so people buy the more expensive bundles is kinda fucked up don't you think?

I was able to buy it before the sale for 17€ or so. Now it's nowhere to be found and the cheapest bundle on sale with the heists I wanted is 96€.

Guess I will have to wait until the sale is over to get a good deal ... ?"
"I have not played this game much but its obscene how massive the file size of this game is. The gameplay in its own right is mediocre, and theres not much strategy as expected. Its a horde shooter with not too much variety nor gameplay exploration, with an outrageous file size."
Starbreeze released bad PayDay 3 so they can ask 100 euros for all PayDay 2 dlcs at least till 2033...
no
it drags on at the start so i couldn't get into it at all and so many cool weapons where locked behind DLC and other things so i just got tired.
"do not buy 
get a crack or somthing like that"
"this game WAS good before update 237. now its just a rotten husk. u CAN join lobbys if u are lucky but most of the time u will just get a error and u cant join. payday has some of the best replay value i know i mean u can play the game for over 5000 hours and never use the same builed twice. i know im hating on the game but if u want too buy it just get the Legacy Collection u get most of the guns, maps, perkdecks, heisters and music. i still come back to it every now and then."
300 gb For Dlcs only
error joining game
Didn't like it
I cant say the game isnt fun but its very poorly done it shamlessly panders with all the famous camieos and yet all the character models are poorly done the controls are clunky and uninspired the AI cops attack you more like a swarm of confused insects rather  then a well trained Swat unit.  It feels down right absurd mowing down massive  crowds of confused cops while trying to perform basic tasks like babysting a drill on a bank vault or moving boxes around. all things considered the RPG build elements and weapon customization is fun enough to keep me entertained for a while
"Broken trash, broken mechanics, broken game, also likes to crash even on good PCs."
"Its sad the spoon is the only good part about this game, I usually make a sex joke but no, not deserved"
"guys this one security guard tank all in the damage in game, 10/10 hostage would hire. But cannot sex the dozer :("
I jerk off to the cloaker
Why do people even still play this

"dogshit game, never ending missions, misleading objectives. never buy this game.
you could spend 10 minutes ""killing the snipers"" like it wants yo to and it will just never end. dying over and over because it wont continue to the next objective. and somehow theres 1 million cops ina block radius of you at all times which is very realistic"
"Truly a god awful game, Genuinely don't understand how people look back fondly on this broken and lazy mess of a game. Multiplayer is beyond broken. Within my 3 and a half hours of gameplay, my friends disconnected multiple times during a 15 minute heist. When in the lobby, we had to constantly restart our games just to have the game show and sync all players. This game has been out for TEN YEARS AND THE DEVELOPERS ARE TOO MUCH OF A JOKE TO FIX THE GAME.

The gameplay is boring and mind-numbing. You're pretty much playing call of duty zombies. Way too many enemies spawn to stop a small group of 3 robbers. The riot shield guys are just god awful and annoying to fight. This game has the worst bloom I have ever seen (where your weapon will just shoot in a random trajectory no matter where you're aiming) making combat so unfun and such a slog to get through. This game just genuinely stinks all around. No wonder their 3rd game flopped incredibly hard.

If you want a bank robbing game that is halfway decent, go play the free game One Armed Robber. My friends and I played that game for sometime before playing this awful game and and immensely more fun on that game than this trash."
"first of all, about 70% of the games content is tucked behind a paywall which is really annoying as the game itself already costs money. You also have to buy each mission individually which racks up a ton if you want to get all the content. I personally purchased all the content for the game because I really enjoyed the stealth missions, but loud missions are a whole other sack of shit. The DLC missions on Loud are some of the dumbest missions I have ever attempted to run on the hardest difficulty. You get shot from every angle including through walls at certain points, plus the reaction time of the enemies are beyond human. Even with the best setups you will still not do a lot of damage. Don't pay for no loud mission unless you hate yourself. This is just the tip of the iceberg."
multiplayer don't work
"Locke is so negative that it makes me sad, like sorry that i cant find one of the 8 fucking money piles thrown around a 500 square meter building. Fun game though"
"Broken garbage. You're expected to stealth when guards and civies can see through objects, never mind the fact the pager system is fucking dumb, but loud isn't much better, Bulldozers shoot you without even looking at you, and snipers can shoot you threw walls. Absolute trash."
"Bank Heist / Crime Shooter, which in reality is a glorified horde shooter with build crafting, and a gross amount of attachments/weapons/content locked behind nearly one hundred DLCs.

One of the first suppressors you get in the game (the one for the starting glock) is locked behind joining the Steam Community, and it is taken away if you leave it. It is crucial in completing most stealth scenarios, and as far as I know is not attainable in any other way.

If that is your thing then that's great, but it's not mine."
I'm more of an grave robber but ok
"this is a shit game, game crashes, bugs, or just simple bullshits, everyone says the payday 3 bad, the developers have 11 year to repair this shity game and here we are now"
"⭐⭐out of 5 stars

In summation, my personal experience with Payday 2 on Steam was largely disappointing. The outdated graphics, lack of variety in missions, unresponsive AI, pay-to-win practices, and toxic community all contribute to an underwhelming gameplay experience. While the concept of pulling off thrilling heists held promise, the execution fell short, leaving me craving a more immersive and engaging gameplay experience."

"play it with friends, or play solo if you hate yourself"
"Dude... *sigh*
Dude.
This game is like so awful and flavorless. I mean, props to the devs for making a working game. It works. I don't have any doubts about that. I'm sure the DLCs are fire, but this game is like a watered-down version of Saints Row [take your pick of what one].

If I had to describe it, it's like if you took the mechanics of SR, then made a single room, and played in it. 
I was so sad. I tried so freaking hard to enjoy this game and I just- I couldn't. I tried to come back and pick it up again, thinking I was being too harsh then I ended up just staring at the game screen after doing another run. After a while I came to, realizing that I was just staring at it in disbelief, thinking 'Am I even real?'

I can't recommend this game. Some people who are not me may enjoy it, but that proves that you aren't me. Anyhow. Join me and the other NPCs in another multiplayer game, because you just won't find **me** here."
So garb I hate myself for buying this
"I honestly don't see why this game is so hyped, it's not that great."
i am not installing epic games launcher just to play online
The camera shake will make you sick

"Lame, pointless game. You can stand in place and shoot cops for minutes without dying. You are getting hit but you are practically invulnerable. It makes the game pointless. Also the interface is woefully complicated and clunky. 

Payday: The Heist (Payday 1) on the other hand is a super fun game and far better than this crap."
Game won't launch at all no matter what i choose
bug in running game
"This game has more microtransactions than gameplay and the developers are talentless hacks, as shown by the mediocre offering that is Payday 3"
.
decent game but they fucking deleted notoriety on roblox. losers.
"Really boring, missions are good apart from having to wait 5 minutes for actions like drilling a vault door to complete whilst you mindlessly kill waves of enemies. If the timers were shorter the game would be really good but for me this just ruins the fun of an otherwise enjoyable game"
It's shit rn with all the AI changes and pretty much all the stuff since U237 has been really bad.
"Decent game, level 10 is really difficult."
Game crash when me and friend open the vault bullshit and bad. I hate Ubisoft
"Got this game as the free game of the month on Epic games, tried playing with a group of friends and just nothing goes right. nothing works. Its so bad, i dont understand how it can be this hard to play with friends especially since its been out for years. such a waste of my time, too bad payday 3 is a hot piece of garbage."
"boring gun play
dead game"
"If you can get past the toxic playerbase, the abundance of overpriced DLCs and the horrid optimization, payday 2 is actually quite fun with friends!...

Seriously though, whats up with these DLCs? 5$ for overpowered attachments? People may make the argument of ""you can still be good at the game without any DLC"" but that still doesnt change the fact that these overpowered weapon / attachment packs make anything you use viable no matter what most of the time. Overkills 'anti-cheat' also fires up if you use a DLC unlocker, which means you cant use a DLC Unlocker and play multiplayer at the same time, which is bullshit, considering the anti-cheat doesnt fire up with the most obvious of cheats.

This game's community is filled with toxic, jaded veterans that talk shit about you if you let them go into custody. Ive met VERY LITTLE friendly players in this game, Just save your time and dont play with randoms

While the games optimization CAN be fixed with mods, its just embarassing how OVK couldnt manage to optimize their own game so the community has to do it for them.

This game holds a special place in my heart, since its the first game ive played when i got my new computer, but i just cant reccomend it to anyone looking to play in 2025, Please go play payday the heist."
"Payday 2 is basically a good game concept. The problem is that everything like extra levels and weapons are locked behind a paywall. The basic mechanic in a first-person shooter game of picking up a weapon from the ground is non-existent? But no, you have to buy them."
Just nah
ceeps breaking and butting my mous on the screan.
most overrated trash I've touched
Shitty gayme
"this game is simply pure crap and boring, which is why barely anyone plays it anymore"
"Its a lie, I bought the game years ago and I'm still unemployed."
"Imagine making an entire game and then locking 90% of it behind paid DLC, and still forcing players to download it, inflating your game to 85 gigabytes. Actual monkeys in the dev team.

Also, the fact that you can't pick where you spawn, or where the bag drop-off is located, but can plan literally everything else makes no sense. If these people were the ones who made PayDay 3, why were we surprised it failed?

If you see this game (with DLC) for like 7 bucks or less, pick it up. It's a little fun, don't get me wrong, but it has some glaring issues that pop up after a few hours of gameplay."
"Too damn old, though I am biased because I am not really that interested in robbery games."
worst ego shooter in history how stoned you can be to not make a crosshair in a shooter game worst shit i wasted my money so far
Is not a VR game but a cinema screen experience where your controllers don't work!
more like payday poo >:D
game is ass
It's so bad
"Used to play this on PlayStation where the devs would ignore the playerbase on console and it left a sour taste in my mouth. This game is actually really fun and i've played quite a bit back in the day, i realized really quickly nothing had changed. The devs do not care about anything but money and it shows based off of how expensive this ""DeAd GaMe""s DLC prices are. Payday 3 seems to be doing horrible also, don't bother even picking that up. 
Honestly deserved and i hope they learn from their greedy mistakes and lower the prices while listening to feedback.
In its current state if you haven't played at all... legacy collection is good but still expensive for like what 5 years old DLC lmao.
Don't pick this up unless its like $20 for EVERY piece of DLC. 
That's realistically what i would say it is worth.




TL;DR: Worth playing if it was cheaper, otherwise its a greedy company that does not deserve your money."
"Idk why the developers made this game so difficult, this game is NOT for fun. The game wastes your time as indifferently as possible. My answer is - NO! don't buy this series of games. save your money and a huge amount of time."
hahahaha payday 3 is terrible
i hate the cloaker
"impossible to put in words how bad this game is and how vile everyone who plays it is... boring, plainly tedious... that applies to both"

Но когда она возобновилась.....моды некоторые перестали работать, игра временами ПРОСТО не запускается, ТИПО ИЗ-ЗА МОДА с другой моделькой вэна игра ПРОСТО НЕ ЗАПУСКАЕТСЯ, а ты гадай какой из модов тебе удалять из папок......СНОВА.

"Starbreeze is greedy and this game just isn’t fun. For 10$ you can buy Portal 2. Go and buy Portal 2, you won’t regret it. It’s a dollar right now, but it’s not even worth the space on your hard drive. Dogshit game, publishers should be ashamed to be releasing another game in the series. 81 DLCs too, what a joke."
game bug / game bad
horrible game too loud and not fun the hard hiests are too easy and the game is borring and repetative
"The recent removal of once popular weapons behind a specific social account is the final nail. A plethora of weapons already locked behind an extensive, costly DLC bundle, this is just an added insult.

Despite falling in love with the game all over again this year after a few years break, this latest move is abominable. If you want to up engagement with this game, and from what I've read about how hard Payday 3 bombed, you need it, fix the bugs instead of locking away more content and adding to the bloated DLC list.

It's deeply unfortunate how this franchise has ended up after such a promising start. I hope the studio remembers why the original players made this game such a success (no storyline, just stealing and shooting) and revisit everything they've done recently"

Also, the reason the base game goes on sale for practically nothing is because the business model is ""Make frustrating game that gets less frustrating if you buy DLC upgrades"". You have been warned."

"its honestly so bad. UI is unintuitive and provides littile guidance. you need to grind to unlock more campaign missions,80% of weapons and weapon mods are dlc locked.

 The missions are highly repetitive and despite the game at the surface appearing to be a stealth heist game its actually a wave horde fighter, and a poor one at that.

The game has significantly less value than any of the other common titles which include a zombies mode or similar because its version of a campaign is just a reward tied to completing a particular mission which is either in base games online menu or is locked behind one of the games numerous dlcs it uses to keep itself afloat.

 the game is borderline sleep inducing when playing solo and ultra repetitive. multiplayer isnt much of an improvement.The ai crew are worthless and incapable of contributing to the mission as anything more than a bullet sponge. 

the successor to this has failed so dramatically its almost comical. 

overall i couldn't recommend against purchasing this game more."
"Jedno z największych gówien dostępnych na steam. Ta gra jest na tyle spierdolona że bardziej sie nie dało. Gra ciągle nalega cie do połaczenia konta w serisie starbreeze cebula by odblokować kluczowe dodatki do broni bez których masz przejebane, i to że połączysz to konto nic nie zmienia, bo ta gra jest spierdolona i nie uznaje tego połączenia. Boty są tak kurwa głupie że gra jednoosobowa nie ma żadnego sensu i o ironio na grze wieloosobowej też sobie nie pograsz. Po około 5 godzinach gry na multiplayer gra prawdopodobnie uznała że cheatuje, za każdą próbą dołączenia do lobby kogokolwiek z automatu dostaje kicka, nie wiem czy to przez założenie gry że oszukuje, czy przez co, ale nie jestem w stanie nawet zobaczyć lobby, od razu mnie wyrzuca z komunikatem ""host wyrzucił cię z lobby"" lub ""host wyrzucił cię i dodał do czarnej listy"" jakby kurwa, CO? Payday3 to też jest jebana kaleka, poprawiona lecz nikt tam kurwa nie gra. Tytuł upadł poprzez zaniedbanie i stanowisko pt. ""a wyjebane"" bo przecież tytuł jest znany przez praktycznie każdego gracza no nie?"

"Not sure what I was expecting but it was not what I thought it would be. Played 15 minutes and completely unimpressed, moving a hostage around seemed to be impossible, felt completely unrealistic and was not enjoyable at all. Maybe just not for me."
Cloakers still give me PTSD
"Game is just so bad, NPC's are criminaly bad. Only good thing about this game could be suits and masks, that's all."
"Eh, the game is fine I guess, but definitely not worth the money, and I definitely didn't get 100s of hours out of it like I originally thought I would. I've owned this game since it hit the steam pages, but still my feeling is ""meh"". I paid for a full game at release, but didn't get one. There's TONS and TONS of paid DLC, locking a lot of the coolest weapons behind a paywall. Again, this is after I've already bought a full priced game. 

Average commenter ""But the game is 10 dollars, quit complaining""

And to whoever may feel this way, nah. The game was 30 dollars at release. There weren't any microtransactions, or DLC, or any of that BS. You got some heists, and the unlock system was SUPPOSED to provide attachments and weapons. Unfortunately, this is pretty much entirely RNG, unless you wanna fork out some MORE money for ~Premium Currency~

 I'd actually be HAPPY to purchase a DLC for this game, if the added heists didn't already have negative reviews, and I wouldn't have to purchase all 78 (not exaggerated) DLC packs just to unlock all the cool guns. I think a reasonable price is 20 dollar base cost, and WAY cheaper on the ""bonus"" content. Like maybe another 20-40 dollars, making the max you'd pay 60. Which is balanced, as that's the typical AAA title these days.

I'm legit looking right below where I'm typing this, and it's winter sale. Base game, 10 bucks, and at 90% off, its a dollar. Ok cool. Anyone could do that. That's like 20 lower than I payed at release. But then there's the MF INFAMOUS COLLECTION, that is STILL 88 dollars, AT A 65% DISCOUNT. The base cost of all this game's content is 250 DOLLARS. BRO THATS A NEW RADEON RX 6600. I could genuinely upgrade my PC for the price they are asking, WHILE PAYDAY 3 IS OUT. 

I ain't even mentioned the mixed reviews regarding PD 3. But just know anyone who overpaid for this game, THAT'S where they put your money. THAT's where this all led, and they're doing the same shit over on that title too. Base cost of PD 3 is 40 dollars, and 90 for all the CURRENTLY AVAILABLE content. That price tag will definitely inflate over time, there's only 4 DLC so far.

So in total, I USED to have faith in this game. I USED to keep track of it, and watch its progress. PD 2 itself is essentially boiled down to ""go loud"" or ""go quiet"", and nothing else. The gameplay loop is SUUUUUPER small for the amount of money they're asking for, and in total, not worth. Unless you plan on sinking close to 100 bucks on it, have fun running around with your basic bitch AR, while you watch the 9x max level dude run around killing everything bc he bought all the DLC and still hasn't gotten his money's worth yet."

"Would not recommend this game. No option to see oiled up Dallas, no option to romance Rust and The Dentist. 👎 I wish I could refund the hours of my life I’ve wasted on this game."
who like this?
installing and running this is harder than anything in the game
This game is too hard for the average casual gamer. The police hit nearly every shot and I can barely land 2 or 3 before reloading. Unless you want to put serious hours into aim training DO NOT BUY THIS!!
"Bad:
Get it on discount.
Keeps crashing, hanging every 4/5 games.
When it isn't, it's pretty alright.

Good weapons are locked behind microtransaction.

Good:
Lots of builds to play with, good music, co-op."
"I played for less than an hour and I saw npcs crouching in place endlessly, npcs moving through walls, police shooting straight through hostages, police spawning inside locked vaults, and more. It was laughably bad."
game not really enjoyable nowadays.
would not recommend cant have unprotected anal with hoxton and sydney
pay day 3 sucks
"Forget the game, DEAD DEVELOPER. F^&KING  GREEDY PIG LOSERS!"
Game dont work no more

"suckz ballz
300 hours of misery spent using a dlc unlocker, I AM NOT PAYING THIS MUCH MONEY FOR THE DLC'S"
bad
Get infected by epic virus
"I think this game had hit it's peak in like the mid 2010's maybe the VR version is more fun, but this just seems boring now, and it's ALWAYS updating which can get annoying"
Remove EGS-Lobbysystem
"Like many a dead game, sold to Epic."
"have to use epic now , big L"
"It's just a cop shooting sim with extended time wasting mechanics.

Go to objective, start objective, wait what feels like 30mins while shooting a lot of cops then leave. Gameplay was so slow doing any objective, after waiting to get in the vault, it's then another excruciating boring wait to open all the other safes.
Other than when I hosted my own matches, I would just get kicked out of any quickplay match 5s after joining.

This game might have been new and fun in 2013, but it's incredibly boring for 2023."
i like this better then pay day 3 sucks
garbage game

My friends do not want to cook :(

"Devs are absolute shit. They don't care about me or you, they see dollar signs instead. They've made a decent game, but over the years have milked it for all they could, including lying about their commitment for no micro-transactions, then piecemealing the game over the years with DLC, now they pushed an update to turn over the game to the Epic Game Store API instead of steams API, causing matchmaking issues and issues with mods, which have been keeping the game alive far far far more so than their DLCs could imagine. 

Kicker is, PD3 sucks so bad I might have wanted to come back to play this, but I'm not even going to bother now. Good job, you killed PD2 on top of PD3s chances of being good by making it a OnLiNe sErVicE game."
"I hate giving Payday 2 a negative review because I truly love it--my time played says enough. But I'm just not a fan of the amount of DLC. Yeah it adds more heists to do, and yeah most of them are fun, but some of it could've been added in a free update, or bundled together so there wasn't so much damn DLC. And don't even get me started on the Steam Achievements. Over 1300! A completionists worst nightmare.

Still better than Payday 3 though."
rad
this gave me nothing but stress keeping me up all ngith please save yourself and dont buy this game
REPEDERDEDE
"i can't open online game , idk why~~~"
this game is shit
"Obviously this game doesn't worth occupying 85 GB of your hard drive memory.
How on earth this game has 85 GB of size ?"
is bad bc i cant fuck chains
"I bought Payday 2 to play in VR, and when i did, I discovred that the experience is extremely unpolished, and not at all on par with other current offerings. Reloading in particular is boring, as you have a timer on it and so cant do at fast as you should. the flatscreen gameplay is ok, but repetitive, and there are a ridicoulus number of cops that attack you, yet you are seemingly completely invincible."
thanks for ruining the game with every update
The gun damage is not balanced againts the Enemy NPC
"The vr is the worst vr I have ever seen
You can just walk around with zero consequences. Cops are brain dead and controls are janky 
Not to mention exfill fails to work"
"Never trust OVERKILL. 

Long time ago they bundled all dlc's of the game and sold it like a complete pack saying they would stop making new dlc's. Then they started out making f*** ton of dlc's again. And after that they shipped Payday 3 broken. I did meet one of my good friends here tho. Falk, shout out baby."

This game for the first few years was good and very fun. Until recently when they added more dlc when the game will crash after the first few minutes.

shit game
"Paid maby 5€ for this game and it´s still one of the things I regret the most in my life. 
What an utterly useless game of dumb, repetitive bullshit."
"Used to be an awesome game...now, it should be renamed to Payday 2: DLC Simulator"
"Once a good game, but now a horrible mess, it is baffling how it got worse in 8 or so years. 70% of annoying characters, billions of enemies that are surrounding you, unbalanced weapons and perks, 80+ DLCs just to play the game, heists that feel like they are made by buffoons that didn't even care about how game got started, and developers trying to be funny with ""DEAD GAME"" outfits and stuff in the game. Fun can be had but if there are balance mods for this game or old versions sniffing around somewhere, but in the current state this feels more like a horde shooter that never meant to be a horde shooter. I don't understand why people still play this fuсkfest."
just constant shooting cops while waiting for whatever task ur doing. Its so boring bc the cops all stand in the same spot as u mow them down

I pay every day but I haven't gotten my 2 yet
"After the Epic update, I no longer play this game. It practically ruined this game and has made it nearly unplayable.

I also left a but before the Epic update, why? Because instead of fixing bugs and errors on Cook Off, they decide to release a new $20 DLC."
This game sucks
i can't imagine how they play this
"Maybe I don't get it, but you just shoot a lot of police and are almost invincible (we played normal). The game is a little buggy and most of the items are either unavailable or locked behind DLC too."
This game is ass
Way over hyped.
Screw the damn day 2 of big oil
cant even join friends
boring as hell
"Was a great game but devs dont listen to their player and give no **** about them.
Me and my friends crashed around 10 - 30 times a day playing it since a long time and after every single patch they make things worse since years.
The player base got rly bad as well, expect many cheaters, people with god mode mods, toxtricity and kids that are doing frustrating jokes about cum, genitals and racism (especially due to the epic games update some time ago).
Games like Helldivers 2 are a better alternative right now. Dont even think of payday 3 bc things there are even worse, devs only want to make money with you. After all these years playing this game and meeting nice people in it.. i cannot recommend it anymore and i got to mention a last thing: devs couldnt let this game die as a classic, they ruined it and desperatly try to force players to switch to payday 3 to print more money with them. SteamDB say in payday 3 are 500 active players daily..  good job you greedy monkeys."
In my top 5 games of all time since I was properly introduced to it and started playing with a crew but I can not in good conscience leave a positive review for a game with such frequent game ruining crashes and bugs.
"After seeing the disgrace that is Payday 3 they still continue to update this game and do stupid choices. Game can be fun if you really force it to be, or just install some mods that make it more fun (looking at you pagers)  instead of feeling like a chore that punishes you for trying to play the game as intended. Sad that Starbreeze can't handle updating a game without adding 50 DLC but that's what you get developing a stealth shooter on a racing game engine."
"CONFIRMADO: até com mod é um lixokkkkkk
instalei essa porra e adivinha só: corrigir apenas um problema não faz um jogo com zilhões de problemas melhor.
e tem também a ideia de que pessoas tem amigos. Então eles punem quem joga offline, fazendo você cair uma vez só e ir pra cadeia (enquanto que no online tem 3 revives)
----------
se tu jogar original: não dá, é pura merda.
se tu tenta jogar com mods: kk baixa essa dll aí pô
ah mas então eu vou aproveitar que tem workshop e vou baixar os mods na steam: nope, a porra da workshop inteira é pra caralho de skin imbecil que ninguem usa
então é merda sem mod e merda com mod"
Boring
А че делать собственно?
shit is ass
GUN
"Game been well to the point every fix just bring more issues than fixes. I'm forced to play with -steamMM command, to the point my game is on life support. Verifying files and everything, checking every corner to fix the game to break again. Amazing, really. 

The game is entretaining and fun, but how can someone enjoy when it gets more and more unplayable?"
"if u got friends or want to play solo buy it, otherwise i dont really recomend it.

pros:
-the game is really fun
-the content is nearly endless( hundreds of guns,masks,outfits, 50 heists(most have incrediable replay value), u will find urself sinking a lot of time into the game
-once u get good at the game basicly everything is viable
-the game is hard, i find this to be a good thing but this may vary to person
-u can meet some pretty cool ppl
-the game has a massive learning-curve, same with hardness, i like this but it may vary to person
-the game is extremly hard to 100%, for a brief overlook on what u need to do ill list them:
headshot 570k cops
get 1300+ achievements
deal with public ds players
need to buy over 50dlc
and a fuckton more

cons:
-the game just doesnt work 90% of the time
-a lot of times u cant join any lobbies
-even if u do there is a very high chance that u will get disconnected
-the game is EXTREMELY NOT BEGINER FRIENDLY, if u join a dsod loud lobby as lvl 80 U WILL GET KICKED, dont expect to get into dsod lobbies until ur at least infamy 1 lvl 100
-starbreeze doesnt give a fuck about the playerbase
-there is like 50 dlcs
-the are some many fucking cheaters it is unbelieavable, the main reason for this is epic games, and the game going on sale way too many fucking times
-its on epic games servers, looks like they can run fortnite with 7mil players a day, but not pd2 with 30k players a day
-starbreeze did something to the ai and now theyre stupidier than a kindergartener, a lot of times they just go thru walls for no reason, they can also peak thru walls making it so u can shoot them even if u dont have wall piercing guns, it wasnt like this in earlier updates
-the way the difficulties hardness is just stupid, on deathwish its hard to die, on death sentence(the next difficully) its hard to live, i find this to be kinda stupid but this may vary to person

do i recommend this game?
yes i still do.the game is still fun when it actually works, and when u play with friends or solo *most* of the problems arent present. expect for the ai glitches.as for if u have no friends and dont want to do solo, not really.

overall fuck starbreeze"
Make it more user friendly for new players. There are way too many options and confusing.
"great game, but dont buy unless you love gambling if the game will launch"
Boring
Negative review solely on PD3. Stopped playing this in 2014 it was fun then and i hear this is fun now.
nah
i like playing as a super human
"As much as I want to love this game i just cant.I played this game almost from the start on my old Xbox.The game seemed fun but lack of console content I decided to move to PC.The game was just perfect and loads of fun.But now the game is crawled whit DLC that u need to sell a kidney in order to buy them.The game was somewhat playable until it released on Epic Games.From that moment it just wasnt working properly,too much bugs and it just crashes from time to time.And what pisses me off is that instead of working on Payday 3(that disappointment of a game) they made PD2 even worse with unnecessary updates that constantly makes the game worse.Im not saying that ill never play this game ever again I still think its a good and fun to play especially with friends its just sad that all of this happened to PD2."

spent an hour trying to join a game with friends and just failed over and over again. Find something better to try.
"I found the game quite fun, but they had to add all that crap DLC  skin bull****"
the heist sucked
"this game is quite literally one of the best games i've ever played. lots of room of replayability, would recommend, fun overall"
this feels dated and payday 3 sucks
"This game was supposed to end around 2018 with The White House heist/update, especially with the secret ending where every agent of CRIME.NET, whether they be the heisters or contractors, get their happy endings; besides the surprise traitor. I'm glad I never tried to 100% the game because it would have been increasingly infuriating to do.

Then the publisher got cold feet with the delays of Payday 3 and restarted the updates to Payday 2 with more paid content to generate more money. This now contradicted the previous ending. The game continued to get unnecessary additions piled on top of it until it was a bloated mess that tainted the respect I had for the game.

I stopped following the game soon after this, as the following information was news to me that just further increased my spite for OVERKILL and Starbreeze. With the addition of Update 237, all further updates and news about Payday as a whole just became a way for me to both laugh and cringe at the continued failings and betrayals of the players who got them this far. 

They eloped with Epic Games to, in the future, get Payday 3 out the door where it comically fell out of skyscraper instead of going up a staircase. But back to Payday 2 specifically, they replaced matchmaking with Epic Online Services, which is the last feature that made me uninstall this game as I want nothing to do with Epic Games.

Epic Games is a disease that either spawns filth or latches onto other games to inject their filth into it. I don't care how much the developers of this game or other games benefit from partnering with Epic Games. It's likely to do with cash grabs regardless of their future intents. So now I sit here and laugh as the current steam charts show that the average player count for Payday 3 is below 10% of Payday 2's. 

After all those delays and promises made, Payday 3 is nearly dead on arrival after 2 months. It is now slipping from mixed reviews to mostly negative where it belongs. Payday 3 will be relegated to the game bundle only tier of games. See you on Humble Bundle within the next 12 months."
dead game
"This was a good game at best in its own time, today, Id say that this game is an absolute dogshit, I would play this only for making fun of it, cuz its so fucking dumb, npcs are just wow, gunfights are okay but, it does not give you the satisfaction of killing a person, which sucks. I robbed one bank and left the game. Would not play this, but I respect the legacy, sort of."
"Honestly, I had high hopes. I'm just disappointed by the lack of stealth options. It feels like the game makes it insanely difficult and unrewarding to try and attempt stealth in the game. If you just want a fun wave shooter though, this is your game."
:(
"worst tutorial ever, u spawn in with shit weapons and have to defend against endless amount of swat teams
terrible"
game is terrible would rather play poppy playtime
"It's a stupid, monotonous mess. It's hard to think of a more boring game."
"good game i like killing
edit: starbreeze go fuck yourself epic games go fuck yourself and almir is big gay"
"A game centered around committing various crimes for money, usually theft or drug production. The progression is excellent, but too much content and equipment is locked behind dlc, and the stealth system is very much lacking. The popular playstyle ends up being brute force or maximum violence with little room for ingenuity."
BAD GAME DO NOT PURCHASE
"They changed the legacy collection to be a static bundle, locking anyone who owns the base game from getting it.
Instead of spending $20 for most dlc, they expect me to pay $78, that's just not going to happen...
Please make a new bundle with the same dlc but without the base game included, I am trying to give you my money overkill but I'm not paying the same price as another full game for dlc released 10 years ago!"
horrid game. made by OVERKILL myself - a stardiseased studio. 🤢🤮
"Pretty good game in general but I wouldn't recommend buying the Jacket DLC if you don't own Miami Hotline 2 Special edition, Like I payed for almost all the DLC's during a sale and now I got fucked because of that, hell I'm also 80% sure I had the h3h3 pack and now I have to buy it again. Overall good game with good mechanics but you get bent over the table if you want to buy a DLC."
"Has anti ""cheating"" measures like spawning in an invincible guard. I use a mod to enhance my experience and devs have built in a way to ruin my fun"
to lazy to play not worth the dollar
"This game would likely be a very different experience with co-op.

Solo, however, the game format was not expected. There is little to no stealth - this game is mostly about shooting wave after wave of cops, who have little care for their or any 'hostage' safety. It is carnage and feels like the devs started to build a game where stealth would be needed but simply gave up on the idea.

The AI of team mates is lacking of abilities to do anything but follow you around or stay like a puppy. Sure they'll shoot their fair share of cops but the only thing useful was when I found I can throw bags on their backs and use them like Mules.

So everything is go in guns blazing (limited as so much content is a DLC) - and the more I played, the weirder the game became and the more parts of the game seemed to be useless and no other point but for steam achievements and distraction. It's fantastic the game is still being updated and additional content is being added but I cannot get into it, though it as rich enough content that it's worth giving the game a shot."
"Honestly don't know why I played it as long as I did. I think I was just hoping for the game to throw something interesting my way, but it just never happened. The gunplay is stale, stealth is rarely a viable option, and you're either extremely overpowered or have the durability and strength of an unborn infant. Plus, to access pretty much anything that will make your game interesting for about 5 more minutes, you need to buy DLC."
"ngl the fact that i can't keep night light on while playing this game is bullshit
this game for me is the basically the ""I don't know why i'm here or why, all i know is i must shoot"" meme of gaming."
"Deleted the game after 6 hours of  DSOD goat sim, host crashes at the end because ""payday 2 moment"". Finishing the mission - oh btw you need your car to finish it, car gets stuck in some bs fence, car gets destroyed and good luck fixing it 10 seconds. Overall 0 / 10."
The game could've been fun if there was a proper tutorial or hints.
"I wanted to be able to play through this game stealthily but was never able to achieve it with randoms.  The difficulty curve is just unbalanced.  All heists just devolve into shooting galleries with little to no coordination among teammates.

Also 1300+ achievements... seriously?  I wish I had never started this game since I'll have this stain on my game completion percentage forever."
Got this for like $3 and I still regret buying it.
"Don't bother buying, dont give money to a company like starbreeze that has fd up the game several times and fd up their new release PAYDAY 3, giving money to starbreeze is letting them keep getting away with raw releases and awful support for their games
just pirate it"
way too many dlcs and general decrease in quality over the years make payday 2 and its sequel worth playing only if on a big sale.
boring as hell
it won't even let me fucking play
"if i had friends this game would sick, but the only friends i have are the voices"
vr
game worked fine for years and then one day I just stopped being able to join any multiplayer lobbies. Spent hours trying to fix this to no avail. Fuck overkill.
"My entire multiplayer experience is either getting in a lobby within the last seconds of a mission 
or just getting kicked before even joining.
I tried 10 lobbies, i get kicked for no reason, i dont even get to play.

So i presume the community is simple garbage and no one should even try this game. 
Let it die, because thats the experience for new players: get kicked for no reason (not even got to play one second).

I played L4D1 and 2, Vermintide 2, Deep Rock Galactic, and always find players willing to play coop together.

I dont know what is going on here.

Besides that, more than half of the content you see on screen is unlocked by DLC.
Weapon upgrades included."
shit game................
j
"Extremely grindy game, made even more grindier by 100 (!) levels of prestige. And then the community is like ""muh uh there are too many cheaters in the game"". You brought this one on yourself, devs.
Also just want to point out that the community is a joke, because they ""boycotted"" the game after the introduction of microtransactions, then the decision was reverted. But what do we see now? Devs have at first said that there will be no more DLC and all the future content will be free, but then they turned back on this promise and started making new ones after the presumable ""ending"" of the game's story, and the community acts like it's okay, because ""the money will go to support the development of PD3"". Haha. They still went to Deep Silver for funds and PD3 is receiving negative reviews."
FIX IT. IVE GOTTEN TO LVL 30 3 TIMES. EVERY TIME I TURN MY PC ON THE NEXT DAY EVERYTHINGS GONE
terrible
When I got this game I was expecting to have bank heist and/or stealth experience but I got an endless tower-defense-like bot rushes without possibility to defense.
"The game is not about heists, but about killing thousands of ""cops""."
i lost all my progress somehow
Worst game i have ever played. Content barrage of bullets from all side and still takes 10000 bullets to kill you. The mission markers are badly broken or just missing in some areas. This game should be burned with fire or locked away  in a cold dark place never to be seen again.
Steaming pile of $hit.  It might be the worst game I've played in four decades of gaming.  Remember that you were warned!
if you hate yourself please play this
Nothing new. Like most clone games this is game and will be another clone of all games PAYDAY.

Shitty game never play. (I hate skulldozers and Cloakers)
no
"10/10 ! ! ! I hate THIS GAME SO FUCKING MUCH ! ! 
I met Johan G. Kant thanks to it!! it's a ruination...."
I couldn't figure out how to start a Heist
"This game very much feels like a free-to-play beta game. While the UI works and the game is stable, there are so many options and clickables on every screen that it's very easy to get lost and confused. While it has tons of items and level ups, it doesn't feel much like a progression as much as purchases and unlocks that don't really affect the game. Many of the levels are poorly thought out and looks like they were a sandbox for the developers. If you're up for a cheap game to waste some time then it'll be fun for a bit. However there are plenty of better games out there that are worth your precious time."
"Payday 2 is a game that almost lands the executions, and in failing to do so proves that anything short of the goal is not worth the trouble.

The game has a lot of mechanics, equipment, upgrades, and design direction that points toward highly strategic and methodical game play. You have things like how stealthy you are, how much you are able to intimidate and non-lethaly subdue people, a wide variety of conventional and non-convential tools for lethal encounters that suggest tactical consideration, and much more. However, the level design, encounter design, AI, and actual in practice game loop beyond the theory on paper is another story. 

stealth and non-lethal heists are almost impossible, as the AI is too reactive and the controls too slow and non-responsive to actually methodically neutralize any obstacles on the way to your objectives (not to mentioned the level design and interaction mechanics are confusing and finicky). Once you get to the inevitable point of having the cops coming to your location, you are met with an absolute avalanche of loose, sloshy firefighting that gets old far before the level ends. While you are waiting for your drills and other equipment to either get through a vault door or find a code and send you to the next door/vault/computer to do the whole thing over again, you will have cops constantly pouring through the woodworks, sometimes six through a door at a time, and you can just mow them down with whatever gun you have on you. 

As you upgrade yourself you will quickly become and inhumanly fast, inhumanly accurate bullet sponge who can hold ten assault rifle and 10 pistol magazines, dumping, rounds aimlessly in front of you. You hardly need to aim and stop firing when you don't have your sights on the enemy. shooting enemies with dual wielded glocks vs. an assault rifle vs. a flamethrower vs. a minigun all barely feel different. All of the tactical considerations you made with your load out, including a lot of the utility over combat stuff is near meaningless. The game wants to be metal gear or mass effect or something, but when you get to the actual game play it is like a much worse version of doom or serious Sam, failing across all fields."

"PAYDAY 2 - что за игра, друзья? Я в нее играл, но меня прямо удивила краска на стенах! Это такое событие, о котором многие умалчивают. Когда ты там грабишь, да, но краска! Она просто потрясающая!

Я провел часы, а может и дни, рассматривая эту краску на стенах. Она такая разноцветная, такая гладкая, и, кажется, что она просто ждет, когда я возьму кисть и начну создавать свои произведения искусства на этой игровой стене.

Игра может и не очень, но краска! Она меня увлекла. Я чувствую, что мог бы стать настоящим художником благодаря этой игре. Так что, если вы ищете игру, где можно не только стрелять и грабить, но и окрашивать стены во всех цветах радуги, то PAYDAY 2 - это ваш выбор!"
its fun but this is the second time ive had problems launching the game fix it
ok
"Imagine a game. Now imagine it being developed for 10 years and having dozens upon dozens of ""DLCs"", all to be purchased of course. 
Now imagine this exact game without a separated voice volume from a gun volume meaning either we become deaf from gunshots or we can't hear any kind of NPC talking at all. 
And now imagine the same game not having a sensitivity slider for the menus WHICH IS GOD DAMN INSUFFERABLE.
And last but not least, imagine this game without a windowed no-border option. And a bug which makes the game lag as hell if we set it to fullscreen unless we look up the problem on internet and find someone who tells us which folder to tweak in the game files...


Congrats, you have Payday 2."
"[h1]Payday 2 - Shut up and get down![/h1]

[h2]Rating: ★★☆☆☆[/h2]

Playing Payday 2 is like planning the perfect heist only to realize you forgot the getaway car. It's a rollercoaster of emotion, swinging between the thrill of the score and the frustration of everything going south – and not in a fun, heisty way.

[h3]Pros:[/h3]

1. [b]Heist Concept:[/b] The concept of pulling off intricate heists is undeniably cool. The initial excitement of planning and executing a big score is there.

2. [b]Variety of Jobs:[/b] From bank heists to drug trafficking, the game offers a variety of criminal activities. It's like a career fair for the morally challenged.

3. [b]Customization Options:[/b] The ability to customize your character and gear adds a personal touch. Want to rob a bank in a clown mask wielding a shotgun? You got it.

4. [b]Co-op Gameplay:[/b] Coordinating with a team to execute a heist has its moments. When everything clicks, it's a criminal masterpiece in action.

5. [b]Frequent Updates:[/b] The game has seen consistent updates, introducing new content and heists. It shows a commitment to keeping the criminal underworld fresh.

[h3]Cons:[/h3]

1. [b]Outdated Graphics:[/b] The graphics feel like they're stuck in a vault from a decade ago. In the criminal world, time doesn't stand still, but Payday 2 seems to.

2. [b]AI Companions:[/b] Your AI teammates are about as useful as a chocolate teapot. Their idea of stealth is blasting through a wall, guns blazing.

3. [b]Stealth Mechanics:[/b] The stealth mechanics are wonky at best. You can be as quiet as a mouse, but the alarm will go off because apparently, guards have superhuman hearing.

4. [b]Repetitive Gameplay:[/b] The thrill of the heist wears thin quickly. Once you've cracked a few safes and escaped a handful of police chases, it becomes a repetitive grind.

5. [b]Unbalanced Difficulty:[/b] The difficulty curve resembles a rollercoaster designed by a madman. One moment you're tiptoeing past guards, the next you're facing an army, and your only cover is a cardboard box.

[h3]Conclusion:[/h3]

Payday 2 promised a thrilling life of crime, but it feels like the criminal underworld equivalent of a failed heist. Despite its potential for grandeur, it's bogged down by outdated graphics, frustrating AI, and a gameplay loop that loses its charm faster than you can say ""police assault."""
Cant even launch the game now on steam its just stuck failing to load.
"so fucking retarded the new ceo knocked down a roblox game based on this, the old ceo like it, new ceo is so fucking autistic and retarded, i tried playing the game with one my friends that didnt have payday but no the new ceo has autism"

"If you see more players in this game then 3, remember at this point you can get the game in gumball machines"
"Complete, trashbag, garbage, mess.

There's no such thing as stealth in this game, no matter which idiots say there is. Everything about this game is, mask on, go loud, shoot up everything, and then steal things. Anything else is so piss poorly implemented that it may as well not even be there. AI will spot bags through roofs, ceilings, walls, and whatever else. You may as well just play this game with a trainer that turns off the AI entirely, otherwise have fun constantly getting caught for things that wouldn't happen if the devs didn't build this game like a pig. Garbage game design for anything outside of loud as well. Small maps + too many people + inability to choose to do things at night (where LOGICALLY one would think is where 9/10ths of these missions SHOULD take place at). 

So hope you're good at FPSs, cause that's the only thing this buggy mess is good at. Outside the premise, I just don't see why this game has any bit of a following. Because the implementation is just so piss poor."

"Man, the rush, the euphoria of hunting down and violently beating the homeless to death is incredible, especially if they are disabled, making it more difficult for them to escape my large meat clubs of hands.  I've loved to partake in this activity for majority of my life, starting out at the young age of 12 weeks.  Since then I've beaten around 2340 homeless people to death, but now I've gone off the college and have to ""Obey the law"" and ""Not kill homeless people"" or some other sissy liberal bullshit.  But today, I found my release.  I was playing the heist aftershock with me best bloke Jord, and during the heist, I found a homeless camp, with homeless in it.  HURRAH.  You should have seen my face of pure joy as a emptied an entire magazine into them, then proceeding to light their corpses on fire with a Molotov cocktail.  I danced around their corpses for a few hours before returning to finish the heist successfully."
Not my cup of tea.

I generally prefer when trying to play a video game isn't like starting a fucking lawnmower. Thanks!"

basically paid for the game and starbreeze login for the pack and got scammed now Its asking me to re buy the game even tho it took out money from my card.
"This game is lagging like shit.

"Overall I can't recommend this game. The base game is fun and is a great way to blow of some steam with friends. The malicious ads, feeling of power creep by paid DLC, extremely poorly written mechanics for a game this old or that has received this many updates, and loads of game moments where you do nothing wrong but still lose due to game mechanics are what kills this game for me. 

First, upon launching the game and heading to the main mission finding hud you are immediately bombarded with a malicious ""join our steam community group or link to a starbreeze account for ""exclusive"" items"" ad. Expect to see this ad a lot if you don't plan on signing up for either of those services, as there is no ""don't ask me again"" option. Joining the steam community group is like voluntarily signing up for spam emails from a Nigerian prince. Expect multiple emails a day bombarding you with irrelevant updates and telling you to ""hop back in"" to the game. The game devs act like clingy ex-girl/boyfriends to anyone in this group and seriously think that this is normal behavior. 

Next, there is the power creep. I'd estimate that over half of the content in this game is locked behind a paywall. This includes heists, obviously, but also includes weapons... and even weapon attachments. Imagine looking at a base game weapon and seeing that 50% of the attachments for it are locked behind DLCs. Additionally, there are skill trees and there are perk decks, with the former making up core skills in payday 2 and the latter adding twists and power to various combat styles. The skill trees aren't locked behind any paywalls. I'd expect people to riot if they were. The Perk Decks can amount to a significant amount of a build though, and over half of them are once again locked behind paywalls. There are plenty of decent weapons in the base game, but I'd estimate that more than two thirds of the weapons outside of the basic assault rifle and pistol choices are once again, locked behind a paywall. There are still a handful of options for specialty weapons, shotguns, and snipers that are free, but even amongst the sparse free options many of them have attachments that are locked behind paid DLC. All this from developers that originally promised that their game would be free of paid DLC.

""As a part of our journey into the future, we’ll be changing the PAYDAY 2: Ultimate Edition to PAYDAY 2: Legacy Collection starting later today. We want to be able to move forward together with all of you in our community, and to be able to do this we need to retire the promise of free future content based on old assumptions (more below).""-Mikael, CEO of Starbreeze (After Bo left due to him running the company into the ground)

Next let's talk about poor development. This game is a decade old at this point. It has received updates throughout it's entire life. Notably the developments that centered on the game around the time of Starbreeze/Overkill's near bankruptcy in 2019. Microtransactions were introduced. Not paid DLC... microtransactions. A company with modest success due to a community genuinely liking their game thought that the best way to pull themselves out of financial insolvency would be to reintroduce more paid DLC and this began with microtransactions. Skins obtained from in game lootboxes that you had to open up using a drill that you paid for with real cash, containing a random skin inside. It backfired so hard that you could hear the shots fired in Sweden from all the way over here in the United States. Beyond poor or greedy decisions though, you just have very questionable development decisions. The original UI displayed stats in bar form, considering the gamer looking at them to be too stupid to understand the actuall numerical values behind the graphs displayed on screen. The numbers we added eventually, but equally bad UI practices still exist all over the place. From giving horribly undescriptive task-tips in missions, to only having 2 basic tutorial missions, to challenges (weekly, daily, monthly - ""side jobs"") that don't even provide a full description of what they are asking for. The challenge ""CQC practice"", for example. ""If action movies of the 1980s taught us one thing, it's that bullets don't last forever and eventually so have to get in close to take out your enemy."" This is then followed by the task of ""kill 100 enemies"". You would be foolish for believing that is all you need to do, because left out of the description is that all of the kills need to be done using melee weapons. It would take minutes for a competent developer to add ""with a melee weapon"" to the end of the description of this task, but they still haven't done so. Lets look at another melee related task; ""Swing Dancing"". ""No shrink would ever suggest going on a melee rampage is a terribly good idea, but under certain circumstances, it can be pretty cathartic."" Followed by the task description ""complete any single day of a heist, killing at least 50 enemies with your melee weapon."" Great, you would think. They actually tell you that you need to use a melee weapon in this challenge. You would be mistaken though, because what the task doesn't mention is that you need to kill 50 enemies on a single day of a heist using ONLY your melee weapon. Using any of your other weapons at all before the end of the heist will fail this challenge. Why did they not bother explaining this in the challenge description. I don't know. Maybe the development staff are too busy working on payday 3 paid DLCs to bother with updating this game with accurate descriptions.

Lastly, let's talk about game balance. The game is, at it's core, fun. It's a heist format video game and it does this fairly well depending on how well you understand the game mechanics. It's far more rewarding to play it with other people. There are limits though. Multiple heists in the game can go perfectly well for the player, but still fail. This is most often the case on stealth heists, where RNG pathing for guards and placement of cameras can seem to fight the player. Worse yet are heists designed so that you can complete them while controlling all of the civilians and guards, but there is over a 50% chance that more guards show up and you end up being forced to go loud on a quest that you were only equipped to handle in stealth. It can be noticeable on loud as well though. Snipers firing off double taps so fast that you'd swear they're using double barreled weapons. Cloaker enemies that can actively take away your ability to aim when they are charging you (who thought that it would be a good idea to take way the player's agency to move their camera BEFORE they were attacked). And tasers that have an attack that can aimpunch you into oblivion with the only obvious counter to be one specific anti-taser skill in the skill trees. A lot of these things aren't such a big deal if you are playing with friends, but they are maddening for the solo player. (the cloaker aim control goes away if playing without AI, but the rest stays the same.) In addition to questionable balance choices there are just as questionable UI choices. Why are none of the skills, utility timers, or game timers available to be added on the HUD. Mods accomplish this well, but shouldn't a game that has seen 10 years of active development realized that players would like to know how much of their ecm jammer duration is left?

Overall. It's a fun game that they occasionally gave away for free. It's much better with friends. And lastly the developers seemed to bear the burden of the studio constantly being in a financial crisis over almost the entire lifetime of the game, leading to tons of paid DLC and a constant overlooking of basic game mechanics and issues that could have been solved if devs had been given the time to work on things outside of DLC.

5/10. Play it with friends, Play it for for free, but remember starbreeze only cares about paid DLC."

"[h1]Giving to PayDay 2 a negative review is something hard.[/h1]

Is by far my most played game and the one that I enjoyed the most. I can let pass the excessive amount of DLCs. Which is acceptable due to the long support that this game received during 10 years.

So… Why do I give it a bad review?
Well developers had tons of unacceptable behavior to their community like:

 [olist]
    [*]First after a couple of years from its release PayDay 2 got “microtransactions”. Most of you will remember it as “consumable drills”.
Just to recap of the ones that don’t know. They tried to charge a fee to open a crate which can have weapon skins. Those crate are dropped at the end of a successful heist, but only would be open with a small fee (real life money).
This creates an issue, because developers since day one said that “they will never add any microtransaction system to their game”.

    [*]Consoles were abandoned. PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 at first got fix updates + DLC at the same time as PC. Then updates and DLC content had to wait a couple of months. Then any new content + update was out of the picture forever, consoles got deprecated.
This also happened to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Nintendo Switch version also came later and got abandoned by the developer too. [url=https://youtu.be/jUOQFgEU8TQ?t=10] The main difference between PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 is mostly shadow quality. [/url] That shows that there isn’t a real reason to deprecate old consoles like PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. At the end this game isn’t exactly a graphical wonder.
Nowadays their mobile port for Android has more content than all consoles combined, but less than PC. Is obvious that developers don’t care about giving to their customers a finished product.

In case of PC this game got a Linux native port in 2016. Which got dropped in support in June, 2023 (on the same update that bring EOS ""servers"").
More info about EOS at the last item in this list.

    [*]DLCs are another huge issue. At first a DLC could include a new map/heist/mission + new character +  new weapons + even new clothing. Then they started to split DLCs in parts. So instead of getting every 2 months a new DLC with all content for, let’s say, $8. Now you have to pay $5 for clothing, $5 for weapons, $8 for a new playable character, and $10 for a map.
I think that even a some point devs raised the prices of those split DLCs, but I can't remember well. That was many years ago when I bought them.

    [*]Optimization was good at the start, I don’t remember having any issues even on an old 2013 laptop, but some people said that they had issues playing it. Each computer is a different case when we talk about running a game or a software.
Nowadays the last DLCs are the worst optimized, the White House Heist* is by far the worst offender. When it was released many top of the line GPUs couldn’t run it at more than 35FPS. It was released in November, 2018.
[b] *This heist is still today uncapable to be played at a good frame rate unless you use brute force by hardware. [/b]

    [*]Many years had passed from all those controversies. Until EOS, Epic Online Services, came in an update on June, 2023 which added to this game some EOS “servers”. Many people had issues playing with friends or strangers in the new “servers”. People can’t even add their friends in their heist to coop and even people got disconnected without a reason in a middle of an assault.
Devs addressed this issue in an update a few weeks later, but damage is already done. Many people stopped playing this game since that update.
[/olist] 

Many of you would say that “Why I care about console players if I play only on PC?”. I reply with “For the same reason that we PC players get enraged when a PC port from a console game comes broken. Everyone deserves a game in a good condition. That’s the reason that we're paying for”.

Also I would like to add that “consumable drills” are no longer in the game, since ages ago, but still is something that anyone in this community can remember. It wasn’t the drills, was the fact that they lied to us and tried to find a way to justify it. Is like when your dad is angry at you, but instead he tells you “I’m not angry, I’m just disappointed”. That’s when it hurts, well that how I felt with those “consumable drills”.

Even if I feel like that, even like 8 years later that it happened, for me the worst part is the EOS implementation. I can’t stand Epic Games and add a spyware that I didn’t asked for. Completely killing any kind of replayability for me.
Even worse devs didn’t learn anything. They also added EOS to PayDay 3 + an extra account to that game + always online to their newest game. Killing, for me, what was a good saga and killing also my urge to buy anything more from them.

I post this review now, instead of 4 years ago, because Valve’s “off topic review system” which filters out reviews that complain about bad behavior of devs/publishers by the excuse of “review bombing”."
Don´t support these developers
good

PayToWinDay 2
Positive feedback is not available in your region
devs should kill themselves. i already created and linked the account and i dont wanna fucking rejoin the steam group every single time that i start the game.
"i use to like payday2 , i found it fun and cool as there are 3 others and you who use any and all kinds of perks and builds and weapons. but now i cant even join a single lobby for any difficulty to any heist without being kicked out by the host for no reason , no explanation to why or even a simple asking to change what i have. i jumped on decided to reset everything and picking the game up from the start again and i spent my first 10 heist trying to join any easy normal bank or jewelry store heist to get kicked out almost the moment i get into it. an there is only 1 person or 2 people in the lobby room. isn't this game fun? so far no , will i comeback? probably not"
"The game is super fun....when it works. Constant disconnects, crashes, and ""failed to connect to lobby"". Like at least 2 a hour. This is the only game i have that has these types of issues, even COD does better in these fields. you would think an older successful game like this would be fully working, but sadly that is not the case."
You'd think EA owned this game. It's another DLC simulator.
"Had 125 hours of progress, lost it all with big June update. Kinda stupid they'd pull that when running an event for payday 3 that rewards you for your progress from payday 2."
"How much did u get paid, [strike] devs [/strike] bois for PD3 non-release?
Reminds me Everspace 2 devs (and others), who did the same on the release and now get back in old skin like nothing happened. Sure.
Make games FREE of politics."
Roughly 90 gigs for a game that came out in 2013. Keep in mind this game used to be 8 gigs.
I dont want to kaufen this Teppich
"released unfinished, aiming on this game feels clunky and hard"
"My friend say COMEPLAY PAY DAY GAME! LIKE CS BUT NO HECKER!! 
then I play and make COCEIN! >:-) 
but friend tell me he no time and i no know what to play how i start cook?
bad menu :={ AnD fRiEnD nO lIkE mE :((((((((((((((("
Games out of politics. Thx for PD3 hypocrites.
A massive step back from the previous game.
No
shitty game
Its just an ok game
"ok. i used to like this game but the community sucks so much that i stayed away from it for a year, came back, still the same, imma keep playing but i really dislike this game and its community, the community will make you upset, no matter what. it don't matter if even racism doesn't make you upset. these people will find a way to make you upset to the point of deleting the game. just like me."
"At first, I felt like it was really bad because infiltration was too scripted and the missions were mostly ""fight cops while whatever timer is running""... and then I realized that's pretty much what people love it for.

In fact, PayDay 2 is [b]not[/b] an accurate heist simulator, but rather a ""heist simulator but we removed the boring parts"". If that's what you're into, you will definitely love it.


My problem is what the game doesn't tell me.
Just like fighting games, PayDay 2 is very deep and offers countless way to express oneself, and both feature atrociously basic tutorials.

In short, it's just like making music : ""Here's a pencil, music sheet and an orchestra, write me a symphony"".
No one taught you music? I ain't be the one buddy. You can sure have a lot of fun, but will ultimately have to learn by yourself through lots of user-generated content.

Thing is, I'm the kind of person who gets easily afraid by overwhelming content without a progressive guide to get better. If you're the same, you will probably not like PayDay 2."
"it would be good but i just need to say that the most recent event was likley the last and the weapons added for the event like the musket were REMOVED why would you remove a weapon like the musket it would have been so much of a better ""dead game"" if they kept the weapon from the event that alowed for ease of use for killing dozers so u can use a good secondary that isnt meant for dozers and is meant for every thing else as your main gun i am dissapointed  but it is a great game i am just salty that they did this"
Do you wanna buy another DLC?
"Goodbye old friend, you was a good franchise."
Game years after premiere drops Native support for Linux. Ofc linux-native version is still aviable but is outdated. So if you want crossplay with friends with Windows you need use to proton. That would be not problem if in past proton wasn't needed. Shame on devs in Steam Deck era.
PAYDAY FIX YOUR GOFFY ASS GAME.IT DOESENT EVEN LAUNCH but the game is actually good very goog
_
"distasteful, disturbing, dreadful, egregious, evil, execrable, fiendish, and flagrant."
"stinky gas,me"
"Payday but you are the one who pays. 
Fuck micro-transactions and epig online services."
why in all thats holy did it delete half of my money and about everything in my inventory
"Pretty fun with friends. Runs terribly. Terrible hitboxes. Terrible AI. Cool gun customization, but most parts are sold separately."
Utter trash filled with micro transactions and bad developers
"boring, low quality. Still costs too much money with the 3rd game about to be released. Progress constantly resets to 0"
Soooo bad game
"says it supports linux, linux is bricked"
not my cup of tea.
Can't even load it and yes befor you ask my pc can way handle this game it runs every other VR game flawlessly but I can not get this to start up in the Oculus and I have left lots of support requests none of them ever get returned....
"its worth the price when its on sale but if it isnt dont buy it its just the same repetitive gameplay whit cool music and harder enemies and maybe im tired of this game because i havent paid probably 100 dollars for all the dlcs 

recommended to play whit friends or whit people and dont buy it if it isnt on sale it gets boring after 10 hours of gameplay or even less"
"GUYS DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME THIS GAME IS SO FUCKING ASS I WASTED 4 HOURS OF MY LIFE ON THE VERY HARD MODE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT NO ONE EVER PALYS AGAIN PLEASE ELTE GAME ITS SO BAD AND HARD TO PLAY IM SO ASS AND IM GOING BONKERS!!!

SICNERELY, MSTEM"
"I really really used to love this game, and still have some good moments with it, when just mindlessly playing on low-difficulties like Mayhem, but OH MY GOD, sometimes it really feels like the Devs hate us. 

There are bugs in this game like broken lobbies since forever and the balancing is out of whack. Not to speak of all of those DLCs with some of them being recycled content (and yes, I am aware that I bought all of them. I'm not stupid just bad with money).

As someone who has really stuck with this game for a long time, let me tell you: Do not buy Payday 2 (and especially PD3) at full price at any point. Wait for sales and when the content had a patch or two (or eight)."
good game!
"Payday 2 is a game that started as an arcadey but still grounded in reality heist simulator and after the first 1-2 years transformed in something completely different that is closer to a fantasy RPG game where you can tank thousands of bullets, dodge all of them like you're in Matrix or become basically invisible.
Add the absurd amount of DLCs, many containing direct pay to win advantages in the form of extremely strong weapons, the clientside savegames, meaning that literally anyone could cheat their gear or rank making progression worthless or the Diesel engine, one of the worst ever used for an FPS game and you have the reason Overkill almost went bankrupt.

Would i recommend Payday 2 when it launched? absolutely. It was brilliant in both Loud and Stealth heists, but i would NEVER recommend this game in it's current state."
Fuck you
"As of update 237, the game will not launch. their attempt at adding compatibility with epic games users has backfired horribly and, according to others, broken the vibrant modding community which has kept this game alive for years. 

Even if they were to fix this issue, the predatory method of prying open your wallet remains. The game locks over two-thirds of its content behind paid DLC, which the community excuses because overkill are incompetent and need the money this game generates in order to continue operating.

Do not make my mistake, do not buy this game or its ridiculous amount of DLC."
"How Overwatch 2 gets shit for being pay to win with the heroes being locked, and paywalling all the cosmetics, and THIS doesn't despite being way more egregious (Competing in the meta requires spending a ridiculous amount of money on this game's DLC) and not even having the excuse of being free (Paid $60 on launch) is ridiculous to me.

If you've got an extra thousand bucks laying around to compete with the game's meta go for it, otherwise you'll be under-performing constantly around people who bought the meta, not to mention the compeltely shallow amount of heists that aren't sold separately. Payday 3 ain't looking good."
"pay to play, DLC damn near required to play this game"
It's your call but for now it's not recommended.
shit game
"I came back to this game after a few years only to find that it's impossible to join any multiplayer game.
All of my network hasn't changed in all that time, so it was something that Overkill changed.

It's interesting that this happened at roughly the same time that they're releasing Payday 3.

I looked at when I purchased this, and it turns out I pre-ordered, so I was playing since launch.
I played over 300 hours of multiplayer when there was no content.
Now I can't play multiplayer when there's tons of content."
y does any1 play dis?? is bad
ass
"My save file got corrupted and all of my progress is gone. Irrevocably. These devs and the swarm of inbred monkeys they have banging out their code can eat shit and die. 
Don't buy this tripe and don't buy Payday 3."
"malisimo, mas aburrido una caca, el sigilo safa pero para eso juego al minecraft con mods y fue"
I will
fuck this shit game it sucks dog cock!!
intihar edin
I can’t into it
ngl i didnt like it just didnt play
this game is bad
no porn
Spent more time adding dlc to cart than playing the game.
No real roles for heists.
"Its crap, Basically made for console lovers and they have no idea of standards.. Just walk out the back of the bank and watch the police spawn in front of you."
"Stopped launching for literally no reason. Reinstalling doesn't work, verifying files doesn't work. Shit game anyways. Don't waste your money."
"Well it used to be good back when I played on ps4, but damn they made this game too hard now. the fucking special special spam and the AI seems stupider now.  Me and my pal used to play this on mayhem, just the 2 of us with bots. now we can barely do hard and I'm not about to look up builds for ""fun""."
don't am like
big oil
"this game gave me:

"i really dont get the hype for this game... its an arcade shooter, and was okay but i only paid 30 cents for this. had some fun goofing off with friends. thats it.."
Not worth tbh
look how they massacred my boy
no sex :(
i cant open the game paybad 2
A great game but the amount of paid DLCs kills it for me altho you don't really need the DLCs it still kills it for me (Like a typical EA game).
dead game
"Played only a few hours. Will continue to play for hundreds more. don't get this game. it doesn't allow you to live a life. All I can hear in the silence of night is ""I will give you my all"". I stubbed my toe and instinctively yelled ""AAAHHH I need a medic bag"" (Update - I have played an additional 31 hours since making this review. THEY ADDED A HUGE QUALITY OF LIFE UPDATE A WEEK BEFORE PAYDAY 3!!!!! SERIOUSLY I am going to die alone as this game consumes my soul)"
"I don't know how people have fun and review positively this STUPID game!
All you have to do is shooting thousands of enemies and place saws that they require minutes of exhausting camping. Without logic, policeman attack you random everywhere with no fu**ing logic. This Bots were developed with -100 of ai and they are so many that players lag and crash. All of this has nothing to do with a robbery, but a badly done and tiring fps. With this I will not even watch the next third chapter of this cr*p!! Luckly I only paid 1$! Not recommended at all, 1/10."
shit server
sex
"redoing my review.
i want to love this game, i really do. the characters, soundtrack, overall vibe, everything about this game is just so good, but after playing it for longer, i've begun seeing the countless flaws, poor balance choices and such in the game.
will i still play it? yes. will i enjoy it? no.
and since overkill have finally jumped ship (a few years after it already sunk) to work on payday 3, this game will never have these issues fixed."
"The game was really fun before Payday 3 came out, now it seems like everything is broken. The epic games servers make loading times go up for some people by a few minutes for some reason too."
"Be forewarned, at multiple times you will just not be allowed to play"
too woke for me
"This game just rubs me the wrong way. No point to it or any sense of accomplishment or progress. The only thing that unlocks the VAST majority of weapons/mods/equipment is paying for DLC. The mastercard advantage is the best perk in the game, yo.

If you want to brainlessly engage in carnage in 15-45min sessions, then this game is perfect for you. 

If you want your character and weapons to evolve to face ever-increasing threats (and you don't want to pay $$$), then just keep it moving."
i only liked the the music in the menu the baambamapapa
"This game became unplayable, why did overkill betray the entire community just for money."
게임 샀는데 실항안되는 거 때매 1주일 동안 못하네 tlqkf
"good game, honestly the player are caind of toxic, you will have fun but by interacting that fun will be lost"
This game good but always force close and disconnected it's very dissapointing
It's a great game....when you can play it. Repeated crashes on almost every heist. Can't complain too much since it was a dollar.
there is like an update every week that barely does anything. bandwidth be damned.
"Money grab asf, wait - drill - wait - hack - wait - drill - wait - hold for money"
This game sacks! I played with my homies. HEFA UR GRABO BULK BUULID FTW CHUM ILY BRO WE BULK BROS
This game is trash I can't change my mouse sensitivity
"They nerfed Linux build, and I know most of you don't give a s#!^, but i aren't going to give a s#!^ about your Windows either, I am just done with this game studio. I will simply recommends everyone not to buy Payday 3 and just look for other indie game studio to support."
"77 hours of fuck play because the game came up with clashing every time I enter to change weapons in the menu,"
"Once great. Simple. Beautiful.

Now full of unnecessary unfun bloat.

It pains me to give this a negative review, but I have to. They really lost their way on this one."
Stop posting
complete a heist and still get disconnected x.x glad i didnt pay much for this
payday: the heist better. get that one instead.
ass
game sux.
they removed the musket

too many achievement game too hard
"Start again supporting native Linux.

Very good review here: https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaco909/recommended/218620/"
"Boring, play deep rock galactic instead"
This game is so bad. Just a waiting simulator
dropped linux support out of a pure vendetta against me and me alone
Could not finish the first mission in VR. Could not get in van.
"wouldn t play it again, even tho i was a fan from the first one"
Unplayable mess
"If you're expecting a realistic heist game with lots of planning and careful execution, you're dead wrong about this game. It's a glorified gun and run with elements of stealth, but the stealth is bar none impossible unless you either cheat or have wasted your life trying to figure out how to get everything to go your way, in a layout that is most of the time procedurally generated. I really hope they do better with Payday 3."
this game wants to make me kill myself
"I have been trying to play this game since it's release, was able to play in the beginning, but as they started updates that were mostly advertisements and the game grew to  3 x it's size something went wrong. I don't know if they tried to upate the graphics and they weren't efficiently rendered but I play tons of highly graphical games and along the course of 4 new computers and a decade I was never able to get this game to run correctly, even on its' LOWEST settings. As you can tell by the computer shop in my picture I am not exactly unfamiliar with how to configure a game to be more playable in every way possible. This is the worst running game I have ever played in my life, the resources the graphics take resemble some indie games in alpha that haven't learned how to properly render their graphics. The base game is like 20GB, updates that are 90-95% DLC related have brought it up to 90GB or so. Not my favorite piece of work by far."
"This Game Sucks.

Couldnt Figa Out How To Invite Friend To A Lobby. 

This Shid Defo Smell"
Mybe it wus liek gud in 1993....not gud ne more
Birthday event broke the simple act of joining a game. God I hate this fucking game.
"AI is terrible.
Gameplay broken.

Joining games impossible.
events break the game.

DO NOT BUY if you want to play. Buy if you just want to spend money."
cant connect to my friend or anything took me forever to figure out how to even get the game to run
"Current state of the game has broken it, releasing payday 3 at the same time the game gets broken is just scummy like every other company..."
Mediocre. Gets boring fast
"Complete Garbage!

Too many bugs to be playable

Also the npcs are unrealistic and there for ruins the game they can see me thro walls."
Keeps removing profile. Would not recommend
КОНОР ХУЙНЯ

"The audio alone makes the game unplayable for me personally, core mechanics seem interesting enough."
besty game
Where is pay day 3 in Russia?
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
i cant even start the game
"Garbage Menus, Horrible quest system, average combat at best, would not recommend, even at 99 cents..."
friend no trust me to do stealth anymore 0/10 cant use grenades quietly
DLC
Game was fun but all the DLC is to costly and a quick get rich scam. Do not support this type of behavior or it'll only destroy the gaming industry. I bought a big pack back in the day for pennies but now they want $70 for half of the DLC's? GTFOH with that BS.
"game loop and music is good but..
the mission selection is anoying you have to wait for the mission you want to spawn and it take forever
you gonna get kick of a game 6/10 of time 
get kick for being low level
get kick for getting notice by guard
get kick for trying to do achivement for unlock
get kick because your not on the escape zone at the same time as the host because your where carying loot
get kick 35 min into a heist juste for giggles
if you dont have friend to play with dont bother, the comunity suck, its sad because the game itself is pretty good even if a bit repetitive"
"pretty boring, repetitive, yeah for 1 buck maybe but not more"
now with epic online services.
"Certainly worth £0.90, certainly not worth the 80GB of your storage. The game feels as cheap as it was to buy."
"Extremely bugged. Joining system rarely, if ever works (and its not because lobby is full). Half the time you can't join a lobby your steam friends are in. Lobby codes almost never works. Provides no explanation for why joining isn't possible. Crashes constantly. Poorly made game."
"Used to be a good game before they killed it by moving to Epic servers. DO NOT buy this game here on Steam if you're planning on playing with friends, matchmaking is impossible now."
"Nope. Doesn't find my mates. It's not working. Don't buy, even in sale. And on top no refund though only a mere 30 mins in game...Shame on you steam...

If you want to have multiplayer fun, for which this game is made for, buy something else, because with this game you and your buddies will only get one thing: Connection errors en masse. Avoid!"
i couldnt buy this what a shame
no sex
"Pretty awful game honestly. Gun balance is bad, movement and controls are super clunky. Every starter gun has a tiny magazine. Nothing about this game was fun."
"multiplayer doesn't work which is the entire reason i bought this game, to play with my friends, whenever i try to invite them or join them it always gives me/them ""error failed to join server"" or something close to that i dont remember exactly what it said"
It's Left 4 Dead but with cops instead of zombies.
"Grabs Coffee, sits down to play me some Pay Day 2 since it's been awhile, Sees ""Epic Online Services""
Proceeds to uninstall and play something else."

any game that has over 100 let alone 200 bucks in dlc and shitty netcode is a fucking joke. Can't wait to see how Payday 3 goes being always online

"as much as I love pd2, in its current state with epic online services, completely nonfunctional multiplayer, and general selling out from overkill, I cant recommend this game to anyone"
bad game
"I enjoyed the game for a while, but there r some game breaking glitchs in dmg mechanics. eg have best armour or resistance + many items to svae u from death and you still die in 1 hit from something u cant even see.
I am having a break from the game until they have smoothed out most bugs GL"
"lol


lmao even"
i hate it cause it has nice people
"Shitty game, cant buy sniper rifle without dlc and cant buy barrel without dlc..."
FUCKING DELETED MY ALL K-0FPOEMGVEG
This game performs like trash. My grandma has made better stuff than this.  Your time is valuable. Do not waste it on this game.
"Newest event nuked the ability for people to play multiplayer, even with steam matchmaking, or other methods like -tcp. the epic server swap was a bad idea. Do not buy payday 3 when it comes out, do not support their business practices."
game nhu con cac
Shit fucking game will not stop getting recommended and filling up search results get this shit off steam its ten years old and its dogshit.
FIX YOUR TWITCH DROP
when is the fishing update????
"Worst game I have ever played, do not waste your time.

Cannot play the game at all, does not let me invite or join of my friends, the UI is convoluted and horrible, fuck this game. Not even worth the sale price."

"THIS IS SO BAD!! I ONLY BOUGHT IT FOR THE SALE, NOTORIETY ON ROBLOX IS FUNNER AND BETTER PACING KEEP YOURSELF SAFE"
i truly love eos.
Epic games service broke multiplayer
Epic Online Services
"Was a really fun and great game, but they fucked it up with the update where they ported it to epic garbage, the game wouldn't run with mods, the mm got shit and it installed epic malware (not the launcher, but epic can collect your data) on your PC."
It will literally never launch in VR mode. If you buy this because they said that it works with VR...don't buy it....its not true.
"VR only review
Unfortunately VR implementation is pretty bad or I would have put more effort into figuring out how everything works. Main issues are turning and two handed weapons. Turning is only snap, and on top of that you use A and X buttons (quest 2 controllers) to turn. this is very awkward and makes it impossible to both turn left and move forward at the same time. There is also an issue where holding a weapon in 2 hands can activate my wrist touch screen and causes my weapons to disappear momentarily. It is clunky to the point of being an irritation to try and play."
only buy if you have people to regularly play with. It's no fun unless you're messing around with friends.
"a great game, but the servers are outdated and laggy, crashes every 2 games"
Idiots with broken drills.
graphics are unplayable
bro ive deleted this game for space reasons months ago now i reinstall it and it wont start up ana i have no mods or anything.
"Newest update made this game literally unplayable, what where they thinking adding crossplay to a pretty old system"
what game makes you play on a harder difficulty in order to progress further
It's pretty fun but don't buy it
ITS A GOOD GAME FR
"It's not so much a game as it is a DLC platform.

In 2023 the shooting mechanics just don't hold up, and the enemies are dumb as rocks. Difficulty comes down to nothing more than the number of enemies that spawn.

I definitely came back to this with some rose-tinted goggles. It's just not that good. I would say wait for Payday 3, but it's going to be chock full of DLC weapons, attachments and characters, and microtransactions, too."
They ruined it with the epic game store release just wait and hope that payday 3 is good
cant play with my friends anymore :(
balls
FUCK THIS GAME. FUCK CLOAKERS.
kos omk game
you will not get a good experience from this game at 2023 as the mechanics is very old.....better go play payday 3
"Long story short, cant load into map. If I am able to, then there are no NPC's and the players don't move.

Not sure what happened, played this game A LOT back then. Just gonna uninstall and leave a negative as it won't broken so why change something."
i still didnt get my pay day

Trash game made by trash devs.
where is the sex mod
the updates kinda ruined the game bc it doesnt support most mods
this game sucks
I cant in good faith recommend this game. Axing an entire group of players that being linux user is wrong and irredeemable to me. I had my fun but no.
"Can't play for the past month- complete desync, utterly unplayable"
"obscene amount of dlcs, with this amount of dlcs it feels like a moba game"
"when first i bought this i thought ""damn im so glad im supporting this cool little semi-company!!"" 
they litteraly sold themselves to epic games and any type of pub is unplayable, dude i just wanna mess around with those noobies being noobies it was so funny and they took it away from us all :("
the updates fucking suck i would install a patch and it would take 3 hours fucking trash game
"horrible public community, half the time spent being kicked, host leaves, lose connection to host, banned. i do absolutely nothing to aggravate anyone and i can't even get one clean game to finish and get this god forsaken grind over with."
sooooooo boring
Always sad to see a game killed by it's own developers choices. Defenetly hiped about PayWall 3 and it's downfall.
It's clunky and boring. Feels crappy while playing. Lots of pausing and lost AI. It's like a 1990s game with slightly better graphics.
"If you like to grind in your games, this game is for you. If that's not the case with you, it will probably bore you to death just like it has with me"
"it was fun when it launched but as an aussie i can't find many games anymore, i just bought the legacy dlc collection too thinking it was alive :/"
fuck breakin' feds
mfw a game is killed by its developers' terrible decisions
I always get headaches playing this game.
Who thought that breaking Linux support for one of the last updates this game will probably receive was in any way acceptable.
"Don't waste your time. I had fond memories of playing this game on Xbox back in the day, but it's complete dog water now. I don't know what's up with the matchmaking, but it's pretty much impossible to play with friends. Co-op is completely broken. Save your $ and don't buy this game OR PayDay 3."
too many paywalls and dlc also the guns feel like shit.
"Although the base game is great so many things are locked behind a paywall in the form of DLCs, although some may not cost a lot I personally have no cash.

edit: they also recently copyright striked a game i liked quite a bit so this is officially a (in my extremely professional opinion) bad game uninstall!!!"
cross-platform shouldn't have been allowed when the game is already unstable as it is
too many dlcs
the game sucks because im bad at it and i dont know how to play it
its aight dont play it that much so it aint that good
"Nah bro y'all are so fucking done. Should've never bothered making payday3.

payday 2 age like complete garbage

"Gets repetitive: there are two modes of mission completion ""loud"" (combat) and ""stealth."" Gameplay significantly revolves around loud mode with stealth having far fewer skills, mechanics and incentives. 

Stealth gameplay is mostly marking guards and sprinting between different locations to either pick up objects, get security codes or unlock doors. There are various tools for stealth but most are only useful for a few stealth levels, like the silent buzz saw or can only be accessed on certain levels, such as spy cameras. On some levels it's impossible to tell when it's safe to move around the level: besides some night-time missions where guards have flashlights NPCs don't convey there direction or distance to the player and some missions like day 2 of ""Big Oil"" have rooms that offer no vision into the walkways; these design flaws can ruin stealth as there is no indication on when to move or where to hide. Stealth also doesn't really have much incentive over loud besides some extra XP, which could easily be gained by playing a few ""loud"" missions

In ""loud"" there are few viable loadouts on higher difficulty which can make it repetitive.

There are a variety of customizable masks

The game can have at least 50 hours worth of fun, after that it's replayability flaws felt overwhelming"
Honestly its a pretty boring game
10/10 I hate stormfiend
"Game barely functions, cannot consistently join lobbies. At best one in every 4 seems to function."

"I used to rule the world
Chunks would load when I gave the word
Now every night I go stow away
Hide from the mobs I used to slay

They once were terrified
Every time I looked into their eyes
Villagers would cheer my way
For a hero I was, that's what they'd say

One minute we had it all
Next our world began to fall
Away from all that it had once become
They all cried for my help, but I stood there numb

I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
And hope one day that this chaos and
Destruction turns for the better
Never a bow in hand
That was when I ruled the land

It was the creepers and Skeletons
Blew down the doors and boxed us in
Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light
I tried all that I could to stay and fight

As the undead roamed the street
Families broken at my feet
Life itself suspended by a thread
Oh, why is it that I wasn't dead

I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
That was when I ruled the land

I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
That was when I ruled the land"
cum?
Keeps crashing
I bought this game for 99 cents and still feel like I was ripped off
Was not as good as real life :(
"this game is simultaneously the best game I've ever played and my worst addiction, don't play it you will be up till 5am making meth."
no sex
tasers give me cancer
update 237
Game got ruined to shit after many years disappointed
"[h1]Not aged well, in my opinion[/h1]

The game feels less exciting these days than replaying Battlefield Hardline. One of purchases I did for like a few dollars and still would be glad to refund (if it would be possible years after the purchase)."
all my friends lied to play with me if i buy this
guns? erm lets keep it family friendly bucko
"Killed this game with the epic matchmaking update and it looks like they desperately want to kill payday 3 even before it's out by adding always online requirements and denuvo, so nice to see my most played steam game's franchise killed off.  No thanks with that BS"
"good game played for 7 hours cant play any more cuz too large
yall gotta lower the size of this game tbh"
"Okay, so. This game isn't too bad in terms of the concept of it. However, the combat is a little strange in my opinion. I suppose they tried to go for a realistic type of gameplay style when it came to gun fights. But I'd rather they went with something like your average shooter game like Rainbow six siege. It's got nice features to it whilst still maintaining a pretty simple combat style. Anyways I should mention VR mode, personally. its not the best in my opinion, however keep in mind I was playing it on an oculus rift S, which really lacks on hardware, it has pretty bad framerate and resolution, and it has many problems when it comes to the headsets cable and software as its been discontinued and there is no more driver support for it, and there hasnt been for I believe about 2 years now?
Maybe VR would be better on a more advanced headset such as a valve index or maybe even an oculus quest 2. But in my experience on the Rift S, its ass.
Also all the new updates (heist releases) are locked behind DLC's if u want to play it yourself / with friends as I believe the people who made this game almost went bankrupt before i heard? So most of the new content you'd have to purchase."
"One of the worst games I have ever played in my life.

"Multiplayer system is a mess. It is unstable, connections always cutting mid heist."
"Cool game. Sadly went to shit after u237. Bay1k has a video which explains a lot if not all of the negativity that the game receive (link: https://youtu.be/lzdi8ggoOGI). Game's reputation has always been up the roof but all the behind the scenes stuff, development and management really show how shit Starbreeze studio is once you go down the rabbit hole. It's more of a problem that has been festering for a really long time that finally gain attention. Not even slightly hopeful about Payday 3."
"cross-platform servers wonky

"This game takes up too much space, 80-ish gb is a bit too much for my liking, my brother gifted this to me and we were supposed to play together, long story short we never did! seine i had this downloaded on my laptop with 16 gb free, you could see where the problem is. besides, there are free alternatives on roblox that play the same lol."

"Don't buy it if you want to play with a friend. The copy lobby code button doesn't work, the place to type in the lobby code resets if you type 'f' (a character included in lobby codes), so we had to literally transcribe the code character by character into discord, then paste it into the lobby code search. It then failed to load for whichever of us wasn't hosting no matter what we tried.

Frankly I want the hour and a half I wasted to install and attempt to make this game work back."
1.4 hours is enough to say i wish i wouldn't have wasted my hard earned cash on this game
"You play one of up to four players in a co-op FPS where you tool up and pull off a heist. For now let's put aside the 1200+ achievements, 82 DLC, and the lore, and just focus on the core game.

Heists can either be done quiet or loud. In loud you arm up with heavy weapons, kill the guards, and fend off the police and special enemies for the duration of the heist. In quiet you take everyone hostage and try not to let anyone raise the alarm, but since quiet goes wrong easily and ends up loud anyway most people just play loud. In either case one player often has to bring and manage a safe drill until the safe opens, then the team has to transport the money bags to the exit point and escape.

Each successful heist grants you cash which you can spend to unlock new weapons, weapon mods, and equipment. You also gain XP which works towards unlocking perks and skills that alter gameplay and give you advantages. All of this combined results in many possible builds with an intricate level of customisation.

The game is quite straight forward in practice but new players are sure to be overwhelmed. The sheer amount of content, options, and intricate game mechanics that have built up over the last 10 years mean you're going to have to do a lot of catching up. Even if you do this game is built for grinding. From generating cash, completing missions, working through the story, collecting coins, xp unlocks, cosmetic unlocks, base progression... it's all built around you playing this game constantly - which much of the fanbase has been doing.

This late in the game's life cycle you'd be better off just waiting for Payday 3 to come out. There's such a mountain of bloat from years of updates that you're late to the party. Personally I was never fond of the grind, all of the unlocks feel shallow and numeric, managing builds is a snorefest, I'm not a gun guy, and it takes forever to get xp and perks.

A good concept but very much built for 10 years of gameplay and spread just as thin. Definitely not my thing but it might be yours."
Just not fun
Mods are broken.

"1. Every time a hostage is moved, and his/her head go through the wall, other npcs notice it instantly. Going through walls is one thing, but to be spotted is really ridiculous and makes it hard to make positive feedback on this for others to enjoy. I love the game itself but these little things make it not worth it. 

2.You cannot play this game with friends or else you get a connection failure from Epic. I wont change my review until i can play peacefully and comfortably online with my FRIENDS. If you cant fix this, then Epic needs to stop being the only ""Game host server"""
"Late player review:
I've been waiting to buy a good laptop for years, with full hype to try out this game, just to leave it unplayed. Idk what makes this game weights 90 GB, but the graphics ain't that good, not as good as GTA V. 

Major problem is with gun's iron sights, so damn blurry and unstable which makes me think that Dallas suffers from cataracts. The gravity feels quite funny, you have to wait several seconds to finally land from 3 meters height. The controls are quite confusing but fine for new players. The lacking of introduction makes me don't know what to do after finishing the 2 first missions. 

Alright the online heists. I don't know what the hell is going on but I kept joining a whole carnage in the middle of the heist, then I found the heist filter that gives me ability to find servers that is ABOUT to start, and still have no idea wtf is going on. I don't know the timeline of the heists, and when I throw my dart blindly onto the board, I get teleported to extra hard heists and then I leave the game. 

Right, and now the cops. What the hell am I playing. Hordes of cops come after me spamming bullets and tasers. Bulldozers everywhere. They keep coming and won't even let you breathe. Again, the graphics makes it difficult to see the cops from distance. My laptop is really good, it runs other games pretty well, so it can't be any issues from my laptop. Alright if this game was released like tens of years ago, I don't see any development to the game graphics considering all the pricey dlcs and the solid income. Even L4D2 graphics is way better than this, and that thing weighs only like 4 GB. 

I've been a solid huge fan to PayDay 2 even if I didn't get to enjoy this game 12 years ago. I've been interested in the story, I loved the web series, I loved the characters, like everything. I EVEN PLAYED THE DAMN ROBLOX RIPOFF VERSION OF THIS GAME since I didn't have any good laptops back then, aaand just to find myself don't likey this game. This may sound silly as shit but I found Roblox version is quite better than this one (as a new player)(I used to be new too on the Roblox version, but I'm able to understand the game mechanics in short time). Thank god I tried this game, so I don't have to be interested in PayDay 3, but I'll follow the storyline :). Thanks StarBreeze for be part of my childhood. I give this game a 4/10 because of 90 GB for no reason, but 10/10 for the lore."
trash game and gives me cancer shooting down scho- i mean bulldozers
CRASH
Just wait for Payday 3 for now :)
This game absolutely does not work. The UI is horrendous and bloated on crime net. almost every single heist you load into does not load properly. this is shit  and it used to not be this way.
USE TO LOVE THIS GAME CAME BACK TO PLAY BEFORE THREE COMES OUT.THE GAME IS SO FULL OF BUGS NO ITS UN REAL ITS UNPLAYABLE
Don't start
"I am thankful to overkill/starbreeze for revealing their intention to scam and profit while pretending to be pro community right before payday 3, saved me some money. Shame i can't refund this game that was made into a piece of garbage for a quick paycheck, but oh well, you live and you learn."
this game promotes robbery and thief this is not good there shoulkd be get reported to govrnment they will get caught

Great game I even own it on PS4 & Switch, but...
* Linux support was dropped in favor of the EGS Crossplay.
* The Epic Games Store Crossplay integration is shoddy.
* & Payday 3 is going to be always online.
* https://youtu.be/prEnZYigE6M
Sad.
At least I'll still be able to play Payday 2 on the go; I just wish I could've said the same for Payday 3.

You can set the launch option ""-steamMM"" to opt out of EGS crossplay & change back to the og matchmaking."

"What even happened to this game before Payday 3 launched man.

Forced matchmaking through Epic Games even if you're on steam.
Crew AI animations are very broken? https://steamcommunity.com/id/windBugg_/screenshot/2488875201243153240/

Apparently dragging the brand through the dirt didn't just include messing up Payday 3, they had to go back and ruin a game that was already really good.

If you're playing multiplayer? Don't. If you're playing solo, get mods."
the roblox version is better
crossplay ded
fucking crashed after i almost completed overdrill (takes around 30 minutes for even the drill)
"Fuck epic servers, fuck always online, fuck micro-transactions"
Requiring stealth missions to perform a shitty fucking final ending that ruins the entire vibe of the game is one of the worst decisions ever made by a developer. Especially since the shitty ending takes so long.
"i bought everything on console shortly before i lost hope of support


how the fuck did i already play over 15 hours wtf"
"This is not a bad game, but I just feel like there is so much missed potential. There's way too many things packed into this game, and no coherent structure, but the things are not unique enough to feel super interesting. You can enjoy this game the best if you just take a small slice rather than trying to dig into the whole thing. The shooting is good but gets stale eventually, and the stealth seems far too constrained and simple. There is a lot of stuff to love, and I had a good time with it, but the game just generally feels very cluttered and unpolished."
I sadly have thousands of hours in game and it means a lot to me as it is a really fun multiplayer experience but for those actually curious this game has a lot of fun class and weapons some better than others with some being outright useless but still fun this game is really old but in my opinion still holds up too this day due to the art-style non the less but as the years go by there is less and less support for the game and the community is either some of the nicest people you'll mean playing an online video game and some who are completely brain dead and honestly take away from the experience from the game and that sucks I guess and I will address the elephant in the room this game is infested with bot and cheaters actively trying to ruin the game cause I guess its funny to them and the devs are not doing much even with the most recent update making the player counts the highest in the games history but i do not see the issue really being solved as most likely with the most recent update being somewhat lazy and not checked for easily found exploits but this game in the state that it is I can not recommend this game as once the crazy from the update dies down the bots will return taking over game and ruining the fun and no community servers can replicate casual because they are either too gimmicky or uncle topia (tryhards) so please valve update Team Fortress 2 no content updates are completely fine not even a balance patch for broken weapons just an update that will fix the bots possibly a new anti cheat system (also let free to pays talk that will be cool :))

"Update 237, EOS, shit game, fucking russian kicks me, always stuck in loading screen, spent 70% of my playtime in loading screen. the game is dead now. you don't even know what lobbies your going in, you could be going in asia or fucking alaska."
"Multiplayer is broken on Steam since update 287 because of Epic games matchmaking integration.
It also broke most mods in the process.
One month after, still broken, I can't play a co-op game with friends.

But hey, go buy PAYDAY 3, right? Microtransations on an always online game seems a good fit with such trusted and talented developers."
"There are so many police that it is physically impossible to kill all of them and take advantage of the short periods of time where you aren't getting assaulted. There will usually be 50 of them out at once with nothing you can do, and mind you, this is on the easiest difficulty. Do people genuinely have fun playing this game? Maybe it would have been better if I played online, but that's not my cup of tea."
"Bought this game recently while on sale. Enjoyed the shit out of it for a day or two and then suddenly became totally unplayable. Freezing up constantly, crashing to desktop. lagging out. Sad because i waited years to finally play this game and got a positive experience for about 1 day."
only if update 237 wasnt made
"This is a nice game, but it f♥♥king ruined my desktop icon layout when first time startup in fullscreen mode with a low resolution."
"Mediocre at best. It's a zombie horde shooter where they substituted the undead with cops Left 4 Dead style. If you hate on the man this is absolutely for you. The game isn't bad, it's just incredibly repetitive and ultimately somewhat boring. It's got a lot of content- weapons, missions, costumes but many of them are siloed behind a paywall. I'm not too into that business model. So you're stuck with the bare minimum unless you spend more loot to get the content variety. The missions are all pretty much slight variations of the same theme so it's straightforward and entirely consistent but that's a big contributor to the mundane. After about 20 hours it felt like more of a chore than anything else.

Wait for a sale to hate on the police.

I certainly don't need a Payday 3. I'll stick with the candy bar thanks."
My friends all stopped talking to me the moment I played payday 2
"They migrated the online services to Epic servers. Now, most online lobbies won't let you load into the level after you've joined."

"Dony get this game now. Due to the servers now being linked to epic store, if epic has problems due to fortnite this game wont work. PLS REVIEW BOMB THIS.  

Other review that makes things better understod.
""The recent Epic Online Services update added crossplay for Epic players at the expense of Steam players. The game won't even function without being connected to Epic. So if they're having server issues from some big Fortnite update, it's going to affect this game too. Where previously it didn't.

The devs have stayed silent regarding the PD2 community's discontentment regarding this recent change, so I'll be happy to give them this review. Don't buy any further Payday games/DLC, remove them from your wishlist and following list, and tell your friends to do the same. It's the only way they'll learn.

Edit: They recently posted a community announcement update with no mention of removing EOS in the game, so my review stands."""
"They switched to Epic Game's matchmaking servers... for the Steam version.....
How thick can your skulls be?
I can't connect to play online at all right now, crossplay is nice but isn't worth it at the cost of not being able to play online at all."
89GB?
i need a medic bag
they killed the game with the current patch i cant find matches
"I'll start by saying, I loved this game and the gameplay it had provided. It has definitely provided me with many hours of entertainment, and to say I got my moneys worth is an understatement. However that said, I can't recommend this game in good faith to anyone.

A recent update was akin to taking a beloved family pet out back and shooting it when it wasn't looking. They completely crippled the matchmaking and abandoned Linux support, all so they can make the game free on Epic games and implement crossplay with them (removing crossplay with Linux). Sure there are more Epic games users than Linux users, but there was always the option to buy this for less than £1 in a Steam sale, an extremely low barrier to entry.

However the main disappointing thing is trust in the developers is gone. For years players have voiced their concerns to the development team in the forums that they wouldn't want the upcoming game Payday 3 to have anything to do with Epic Games. As the largest Steam community group it makes sense that at least some people have this kind of launcher loyalty. However it was clear years in advance that the community didn't want something like what recently happened to happen. That said the developers decided to do it anyway.

I'm not sure if this was a result of them having to accept a publisher agreement with anyone who came along due to the financial struggles, or if they had agency to choose to turn it down, but at the end of the day it doesn't matter, the game is still worse off because of it.

This game will still be superior to the upcoming release Payday 3, which looks absolutely horrendous mechanically, however that's a low bar.

Gameplay wise last I checked several heists (missions/levels) straight up don't work. Connection to other players is borked, especially in multi-day heists. There are more cheaters and pirates than ever. And they kept adding weapons as paid DLC but no inventory room to hold said weapons. Games are still peer to peer but the matchmaking having changed makes the game was more unstable.

Overall the game is in a sad state, it was willingly made into what it is now just months away from retirement. Despite concerns being voiced for years about this exact kind of thing. It's almost funny how wrong the developers got it. Almost, in reality it's just sad."
Can't recommend this game in its current state.
sad that this game didnt hit me like others. :(

old review: do it solo with bots, the community is not as good. lore is very weird and joy breaks the fourth wall 24/7, funny game, MEDIK go brr, you're a vampire apparently as you use blood bags to heal, but there are still improvements to be made, such as fixing performance, i really dont like getting 10 fps in a contract. paragraph done old rating: yes"
.
fucking dog shit game. WHO THE FUCK MADE THE BOTS IN THIS GAME. bro im trying to get some money to feed my kids and my fucking teammate bots ARE JUST FUCKING WATCHING ME DIE AND DONT SHOOT. 0/10 wasted so much time on this garbage ass game
KEEP DYING BECAUSE THE BOTS ARE USELESS

"I can't in good conscience recommend this game to anyone without very specific tastes.

The game is a little janky at best, actively hates new players by gimping their progression early on and basically forcing you to buy massive amounts of DLC to be playable on harder difficulties because of a decade worth of powercreep. Not to mention the devs having a spotty history with questionable decicion making and player communication, and the recent matchmaking fiasco (I bought this game a day before the move to EGS, it was working fine on that day, but has been unstable ever since, even with various workarounds).

If fast paced PvE is something you absolutely love and need more of, right now, then you can consider trying Payday out, but I don't think it's worth anybody else's time, especially looking at recent actions of Overkill and the risk of them killing of this game any moment, as they did with the Linux version, looming."
Ass
this game sucks to play with friends everyone always disconnects if we can even get everyone in a party together. game is jank as hell now. if you all fix it then maybe it would be fun again

"New update totally destroyed this game, new agreement is straight bs. WTF is the deal with everyone crapping on their own work? NO, I will not accept new terms or agreement to anything, like can I have my whole 10 dollars back for this decade old turd? I foolishly had figured this game was old af and we were far past all this garbage. I bought this on Steam, Not on Epic. ""Epic Games"" blows harder than gale force winds. I want nothing to do with anything payday anymore, throw your new ""titles"" straight in the trash. Peace."

"Gee, sure love dumping an hour into a difficult heist, getting towards the end of it, just for the game to crash and have me forfeit all my cash and XP I would have earned. Great job, developers! You had one job, and over 10 years to do it."
"Man this game stinks. I already know im gonna get a lot of hate for it but after playing for a full day almost at this point I can say it stinks. The AI isn't very useful so if you ever want to play this offline or by yourself expect to do ALL the lifting. The AI does hold it's own against the enemy at least. I rarely if ever saw them get downed and need to be revived. Meanwhile because I was having to do all the lifting of the big items I was constantly having to be picked up by them cause I was moving slower. 

Now if you go for online with other people it makes it WAY better and more fun. Except for the fact the games servers really stink. There has been SO many times where I have gotten stuck on a frozen screen waiting for: A player to join, connect to a server, loading the map, waiting for the payday card, waiting for other players to be ""ready"". Now it doesn't look frozen in some instances cause you can still hit escape in some of those instances and quit to main menu but if you are near the end of the mission you then will lose out on all that work you did. There has been many times where it will show a player joining only for it to be stuck at 97% or 99% and so your sitting there for 5 minutes waiting only for connection to the host lost or some crap. 

There has been many times where I click ""ready"" and see other people ""not ready"" but they claim in chat they are ready but everyone else is ""not ready"". There was even a mission where it was VERY difficult like one of the worst difficulties and I was with 3 others that were way better and just following them. I was managing my own but I know if it wasn't for them I would have been taken out countless times. It was a chase mission following a white van. All of a sudden like a block from the van everyone froze. The enemies were just sitting there and I could walk around and head shot them all. My team mates were also frozen. I tried reviving one only for it to keep making the sound like I did but nothing happened. Got to the van with an ! and couldn't interact. One of the other players said they could see me but I couldn't see them moving, they asked me to get the gas can to light the van on fire. I got the can but couldn't do anything at the van. So basically had to leave the server cause there was nothing I could do at that point. All that work for NOTHING! Like WTF ""OVERKILL"" ? 

Why are your servers so dog poo? This is why I hate games these days when you have to rely on the companies servers. If they allowed players to host their own servers to, then maybe we wouldn't have this many problems. Also the fact that in idk 20 years when they turn off the servers then you're out getting to play the game anymore, except maybe in offline mode with the bad AI. 

There is also the fact there is HUGE amounts of DLC that you need to buy in order to access.. hmm most of the weapons, skins etc. if not more. The skins are one thing but locking certain weapons behind DLC is a bit annoying. Would be nice if you could randomly win them over time from playing some missions but oh well. That also raises the attachments for the weapons. I bought a silencer for a weapon and then later decided to take it off and it said it went to my inventory. Okay but then I couldn't find a way to put it back on the weapon. I looked it up and saw posts stating you have to pay to use the attachments if you take them back off. So it's just a money sink (in game money) which is really annoying. As well as some attachments you can't get cause they are ""unavailable"" until you get them from random payday card picks? So you're gonna have to grind A LOT to get different attachments while also getting colors, skins, money, XP as possible payday cards instead. 

I am still upset about the countless disconnects from the servers in the middle or at the end of a mission losing out on all the work and the rewards because of their stupid servers. And I know it's their servers because my internet is quite fast, I can watch shows/movies without having to worry about buffering etc. And thus the game also feels a bit like p2w because of having certain better weapons/items stuck behind DLC. 

I am kinda glad I got this game for just a $1 cause of the sale recently. Apparently it was free a few years ago but missed out on it back then. I am guessing they are doing this sale to get people interested in the game to try and sell them Payday 3 when it comes out. But with how bad these bugs/glitches are especially with the servers it just shows to wait or not get the 3rd game because after all this time this game still has these kind of problems, really? 

One person in one of the missions said it has to do with Epic Games launcher messing up cause there is cross platform play or something? No idea how true that is but still annoying.

The premise and gameplay can be a lot of fun. There was many times I was eagerly wanting to run a bank heist only for some bug/glitch where you are seen through a wall, or lose the connection with the server and by the time you try and get back in it's full or ""failed"" to connect. There has also been a number of times trying to join a public mission only to be kicked right away. Heck one of them today I got banned, and then kicked from a server I tried joining. Like if you don't want people joining your server, make it private you morons. 

Also seeing ""cheater"" above some peoples heads is a bit weird. So the game knows the person is cheating but allow them to? As well as people getting kicked for having mods I guess? I don't have any but didn't even know there was some out there. And seeing stuff like ""green package"" or whatever being picked up by other players but then at the end of the game seeing a message in red ""you need to own bla DLC in order to receive this"" or something is a bit annoying as well. 

One player in voice chat mentioned owning the game since release and how it was much worse back then with certain stuff but has since gotten better. I know if I would have paid full price for this game I would have been really pissed off by how bad it is now let alone if it was worse a while back. Right now if you get the game for free or dirt cheap then it's a gamble if you're gonna have fun with so many server issues. As well as be prepared for a long grind to get rewards.

Again losing out on lots of money, xp, and payday card reward because the server messed up and you get sent to the main menu at the end of a mission over and over again is infuriating. Happening over and over again, even during this 10 year event is really annoying. Especially after spending a good hour or so for none of it to matter at all. Making this game more like a chore than fun."
"gunplay is terrible, outdated and trash, anti cheat is very bad, i hate the movie, i hate the game, super boring, every item is dlc and costs even more money just to waste your time and money playing a stinky game with over 1,000 achievements. i hate."
"Sucks that they let the game go. Minor bug fixes would make this game playable, but nope. Decided to buy the last of the DLCs, I know mistake, just wanted to play them and get a ltitle fun in before payday 3, but they've abandoned this, but are still releasing content and taking people's money yet they won't even take a moment to fix the minor bugs. Makes me really not want to get and play the 3rd one because they could just abandon us again. Sucks playing crash simulator 2023."
horrible UI. floaty controls. goofy stealth
"This is the worst experience of a game you will ever have. I have a steam deck and the game used to run fine through proton or linux runtime, now it only actually launches in the linux runtime. There's a problem though: This game is only fun with friends. They dont update the linux version anymore so you cant play online, while they proudly take advantage of the verified seal and put on their store page its linux compatible. I tried to get a refund but due to this process of trying to get the game to launch I spent too long in menus to return it. Dont waste your money if you have a steam deck. This should be marked as unplayable."
My game crashed to show this review screen on Steam. Thanks for leaving the game in terrible condition Overkill. Fun game tho.

"it's more focused on shooting than actually robbing, good game but not for me
6/10"
"if i had a dollar for every brightness in this game, i would be in debt holy fuck!"
"Game has become unplayable. 
When you try to join someone else's lobby, you (most of the time) do not load in, game tells you that you are waiting on others ""Joining"". This is not the case. You sit there for 5-10 mins, until you get bored, join a different lobby for this to occur again and again. This has never plagued my experience in the past, yet after a year or two, come back to the game and this has been my experience."
"I hate to do it but i have to.

I love Payday since PD:TH and PD2 is no exception. It was alot of Fun in 2014/15, before too much crap was added to the Game. I write this Review from my own Expression so you dont have to support it. Either you understand or not, its up to you.

[h1] Adding MTX [/h1]

One still infamous Thing the OG´s still remember. Some Peoples 9 Years ago were afraid of Overkill adding MTX to the Game with new Skins and the Safes, wich by now is an extremly bad Joke. Almir replied to the Peoples, there wont be any such Thing like MTX and it happened the next few Weeks, they actually added MTX. This made the Players understandably furious and released a huge Wave of Hackers and Cheaters in the Game and it still hits today. Peoples simply didnt care anymore and ruined the Game for others. Also you could purchase the drills for your Safes you looted (representing Lootbox) to open your Safes and you HAD to purchase them. They took it off so the Peoples who actually spend Cash on it, literally wasted it now.
Good move OVK

[h1] Update 237 [/h1]

Yes you cant talk about Payday now without mentioning the Infamous Update that broke the Game.
Like i asked for anything coming from Epic Games but yes thanks. It made the Game absolutely unplayable with even bigger Connection Issues as before. Its hard to join Matches and stay in Matches. I allready had problems getting in some Matches and actually stay but now its a Problem and im not the only one having this Issue. They managed to fix the Problems but were not successful. With the Update i couldnt connect in 9 of 10 Matches, now after the fix i cant connect in 8 of 10 Matches. Great. It also is during the Match a huge Problem. While Peoples having an attempt to connect, it just stops and doesnt progress on. Peoples in the Match are forced to wait for the poor guy to either connect or just leave or being kicked. Makes it even unfair. It doesnt seem, that OVK wants do go for another fix. Thanks.

[h1] Peer to Peer Sh!t [/h1]

I hate the Connection Type the Game uses. Instead of active Servers, everyones Computer just gets connected to each other and it can become a Problem for the Match. Its enough for one Guy to have crap Internet connection and you being dropped out of the Match. This was good and fun in 2001. Dont get me wrong, this can be good if everyone has a stable Connection and it decreases Game delays but the Chance for having a Match with everyone staying tuned is absolutely minimal. I see the Sentence ""Add Playername disconnected"" or just me being disconnected happens in almost every Match.

[h1] Bro whats with the DLC`s? [/h1]

I dont like the Way that OVK now adds so many DLC`s in the last Time. While the Game is allready told to go down because PD3 almost hits the Scene, they just keep adding alot of DLC`s now in the last 2 Years. Where they have been 8 years ago? I commonly have no Problems with DLC`s, because you dont have to buy them and most of them are cosmetics but i still have an Issue with it. Since im still going for the DSOD completion and also the special Mask of it (not finished yet) they keep adding new Heists in the mix trough DLC´s and they for whatever reason are counting for the DSOD Progression. So if i ever want to still get the Mask, i have to play the DLC Heists too so that actually forces me to buy them and this is were i draw the Line. It would be absolutely ok if the DLC Heists wouldnt have to be done too for it but yea i guess they really need my Money. Thanks again OVK.

[h1] Common Ingame Issues [/h1]

Now this Chapter of my Review is a No Brainer. I just want to recollect the Problems i see in the Game itself.

[u] Peoples dont use Pre-Match Settings [/u]
I loved the Way that the Devs added Settings to the Matches the Hosts open to clarify, if it is supposed to be
a Stealth Mission or a Loud Mission but almost no one uses it. So you often get ended up looking for a Loud Mission but you join a Match wich is supposed to be Stealth and the other way arround. It wastes Time.
This is something i dont blame the Devs for it but rather the Players.

[u] Peoples dont use the Heist Pre-Planning [/u]
Some Heists in the Game have a whole Preplanning Section, where you can add Stuff to the Heist or Change the Loot drop off Point or Escape Point. Very good i like it but again alot of Peoples are not even using that. So it happens often you join a Big Bank Heist or Golden Grin Heist, where the common Escape/Loot drop Point is over what feels like 500 Miles away while it can easily be changed via Preplanning to a closer Point.
I dont have a Problem with carrying a few Bags over 100 Metres away but it isnt Fun to carry like 20 - 30 Bags over this Distance. The Bag carrying Mechanic is ok but needs to be done right. There is a difference between a Heist that can be done in 15 - 20 Minutes and a Heist that is done in 50 Minutes (Golden Grin Moments).

[u] Wish to have more ""Only this"" Heists [/u]
Some Heists in the Game are only Stealth and some are only Loud. The Game showcases Heists with a blue Ghost Symbol as a ""Stealthable"" Heist but it doesnt make it clear if it is ONLY Stealth. Its not so comfortable for newer Players because they dont know better. Not a huge Problem but i still wish for Heists that are only Stealth and only Loud. If you fail a Stealthable Heist, you still can Progress on but only Stealth Heists just give you a Timer untill the Heist just stops and drops you back into Preperations. Some Stealthable Heists are done quicker in Loud anyway so whats the Deal? 

[u] Trollwave? [/u]
It happened to me the last 5 Years incredibly often where i join Matches but the Host kept kicking Peoples Instantly, also me. Once again pointing at the Pre-Match Settings. Their Lobbys didnt even fill up afterwards so i expect them to do that by Boredom. Some even gave perma Bans. Its extremly annoying. If they want to play alone anyway, they can make a closed Match from the Settings on but just because they dont, i might believe, they are actually Trolls and there are alot of them. Since u237 i didnt met those ""Trolls"" anymore but i guess we have bigger Problems now. Just wish there would be a better Kick/Ban Protection to prevent ""Trolls"" to just non stop kick Peoples.

[h1] Conclussion [/h1]

I complete my Review with a few last Words. Im rolling down 2022 Hours now and i still Enjoy the Game, even though there are Problems, even noticable ones but i cant walk the Path anymore without dragging Shame with me. Its after all still a good and enjoyable Game if you manage to ignore some of the Problems that happen in the Game but for now i feel like i shouldnt recommend the Game to anyone as long as OVK doesnt Change stuff. I loved the Game, where DW was still the highest Difficulty and it brought me alot of great Memorys wich PD2 definitly turns into a classified hood classic Game."
"I cant even launch the Fucking game without -steamMM and when I do I cant join other people or even people, who do do -steamMM ( through the steam interface)  . I wonder If I can still refund the game because this is ridiculous that the default is epic servers and I can only play solo when you switch back"
"Buggy, awful game that takes 100 gigs to download for no reason, and everything is locked behind a paywall to actually experience the game waste of time."
"i don't like game




too many hour."
this game made me an extremely violent criminal in real life
All of the heists are good except big oil. Fuck big oil
terrible AI
No sperm bank heist
"Payday 2 is an overall amazing game with great music, characters, etc. but after the most recent update, It has became almost unplayable in multiplayer. Public Lobbies are a 1/10 chance that you'll actually connect and be able to play the game and if for any reason you fail the heist or game bugs out you are screwed and have to try rejoining 30+ times just for it to work and then bug out again. All in all, Payday 2 is really good if you prefer the solo experience, but if you're looking for a game to play with friends, I'd suggest just to save your money for the next Payday (Which is out in September of this year)."
"It is incredibly buggy on all aspects except the menu. Multiplayer is borderline impossible on every aspect of joining lobbies. Players have attachments bug out or use a specific username are auto flagged as cheaters and are kicked from lobbies half the time. if your gonna get the game, go solo or don't at all."
"i decided ""hey i should play payday 2"" so i did
then i saw what the fuck happened to this game and decided ""Oh, i shouldnt have started NOW"" and im still playing it, god help me"
"Es divertido con amigos.

Ni tengo amigos"
I used to recommend this game mods worked perfectly. If I wanted to play the console versions I would have bought those again. I got the PC one for the mods cause who doesn't on PC games. The new updated with Epic servers methed everything up. I now do not recommend this super old ssa game to anyone that wants to jump back into it with extras cause you will have to delete most of your add ons if you wanna play online. Maybe payday 3 will be better.
NO PLAYTOYPARTING!
got rickrolled. Fuck this game.
game give me dizziness and the missions I played were too long and boring
Payday 2 shit
they ruined it
"Yeah this game is still broken for me after this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ EOS integration, every person that joins my public lobbies either can't join in general, or would join and instantly get disconnected, or would sit at ""Player is joining the heist: 100%,"" but never actually join, causing me not to be able to finish the heist because the join screen is indefinitely stuck on my screen. How did y'all ♥♥♥♥ this up so badly, so late into the games life cycle? This doesn't bode well for PD3. Like, I love this game, seriously. But I've NEVER HAD THIS MANY MATCHMAKING ISSUES, CRASHES, AND OVERALL BUGS UNTIL THIS EPIC UPDATE. Really dropped the ball on this one.

Also, side note for everybody that says ""UsE -StEaMmM"" yeah that may work for public lobbies, (Granted the lobbies are about 1/10th of what you see normally because not everybody knows about this workaround.) but you literally can't join friends with that enabled. Tried with a buddy, both running -steamMM, both ON STEAM, and i invite him (once again, THROUGH STEAM.) he hits join game, and literally nothing at all happens. Great workaround everybody. Great job shoehorning Epic into this, Starbreeze. Epic has the BEST track record with caring about games and their servers, right guys!?

TLDR; Epic integration broke this game entirely, and I personally don't think they care enough to fix it with PD3 around the corner. Don't expect to have any type of MEANINGFUL online experience. Cannot recommend at this time."
The game keeps on crashing and there's clearly a lot of other problems that should be fixed and it certainly shouldn't take up almost 90gb
worst game i've ever played wtf
the virgin payday 2 vs the chad entry point
"It was a game I would recommend, probably still if you go to your advanced options and type ""-steamMM"" into the console so you can access the steam servers again. But now the main reason why I loved playing payday 2 was taken away after update 237. Crossplay ruined a big core part of the gameplay for me, many players on steam don't even know they can go back to the steam servers (probably because Overkill and Starbreeze didn't present this as an option from starting up the game), connecting to Epic Online Services is a pain in the ass, Games have trouble starting sometimes just because 1 player didn't connect to the servers properly, you can't host games with a modded client on steam so just using something like a hud mod makes your public games not appear at all, you can't find public games close by anymore so everything is worldwide (good luck doing achievements with language barriers), and worst of all Cheaters run more rampent then ever. If lootboxes in payday 2 wasn't the 9/11 of this game, Crossplay is it now. And if this shit doesn't get fixed in time for payday 3, if the online for payday 3 is going to be as shit as current payday 2 online, I am going to savior every reaction for those people who have doubted me."
"Title: Payday 2: A Heist Gone Wrong in the World of Crime

Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2/5)

Payday 2, once touted as the ultimate heist simulator, falls short of expectations due to its outdated mechanics, repetitive gameplay, and lack of meaningful progression, resulting in a gaming experience that feels more like a chore than a thrilling criminal escapade.

One of the most glaring issues with Payday 2 is its failure to evolve and innovate since its initial release. While the game initially garnered praise for its unique premise and cooperative multiplayer gameplay, it has since stagnated, with few meaningful updates or improvements to keep players engaged. The core gameplay loop of robbing banks and completing heists feels tired and uninspired, lacking the tension and excitement that should accompany a life of crime.

The game's mechanics are also showing their age. While the basic mechanics of shooting, stealth, and teamwork are present, they feel clunky and unpolished compared to more modern shooters. Movement and gunplay lack the fluidity and precision seen in newer titles, making it difficult to pull off satisfying heists or engage in intense firefights. The lack of innovation in gameplay mechanics further contributes to the game's feeling of stagnation and irrelevance.

Moreover, Payday 2 suffers from a lack of meaningful progression or sense of accomplishment. Completing heists and earning cash rewards feels hollow and unrewarding, as success often hinges more on luck or grinding than skill or strategy. The game's progression system is heavily weighted towards grinding or paying real money to unlock new weapons, mods, and cosmetics, further cheapening the sense of achievement and satisfaction that should come from unlocking content through gameplay alone.

The game's presentation is also lackluster. While the gritty visuals and atmospheric soundtrack attempt to capture the essence of the criminal underworld, they feel dated and uninspired. Environments lack detail and atmosphere, while character models and animations are stiff and lackluster. The lack of polish and attention to detail further detract from the game's ability to create a truly immersive and engaging experience.

Furthermore, Payday 2 suffers from technical issues that disrupt the overall experience. The game is plagued by frequent bugs, glitches, and performance issues, ranging from minor annoyances to game-breaking problems. These technical shortcomings disrupt gameplay and immersion, making it difficult to enjoy the game even when it does manage to run smoothly.

In conclusion, Payday 2 is a disappointing heist simulator that fails to live up to its potential. Its outdated mechanics, repetitive gameplay, lack of meaningful progression, and technical issues make it difficult to recommend to anyone other than the most dedicated fans of the genre. With so many other cooperative multiplayer games offering more engaging and immersive experiences, Payday 2 falls short of being a worthwhile addition to your gaming library."
mid
this game bad
"Tremendous amounts of grind, most of the guns are literally shit and only a few are viable, connection randomly gets lost to friend lobbies every once in a while, AI is total garbage and the game is super poorly optimized.

And yet here I am waiting for Payday 3."
"Broken updating. Linux support dropped. Bugs everywhere.

This game has turned to absolute shit. Most of the hundreds of weapons have become useless, there's a plethora of confusing and obscure progression systems, heist objectives are extremely unclear, and you'll struggle to survive in any heist over the low-money ones unless you're playing the very strict meta (which, of course, requires expensive DLC weapons)

Payday 2 has undone everything good that Payday ever did. I have very grim hopes for Payday 3 - But, of course, you're still gonna shovel money at them, aren't you?"
game sucks fuckin balls
So fun I steal da money!
glitchy ahh fucking game
I STILL HAVENT GOTTEN MY FUCKING DLC
not working i dont like it fuck skyguy
Broke dick piece of shit game

"I was hoping for bank robbing, taking hostages, going stealthy, working your way out of issues.

It's just waves on enemies. There are some levels are that impossible to play stealthily and others that they make incredibly difficult, just so you have to fight cops. That wouldn't be too bad, but the combat really isn't that great.

It's fun if you have a cheat menu and a couple friends, otherwise it's not great."
good game but sold itself out to epic games
"The developers completely lost their vision of making a heist game. updates have overtime reduced PD2 into some kind of marvel tier cesspit of bloated content that killed any coherence the game had. Seriously they should have just stuck to the PD2 original 4 + hoxton, everyone else is shallow & forgettable, worst of all the huge amount of characters added meant barely any unique dialogue exists. The tone of payday has also been reduced to le whacky reddit shit with garbage like the goat simulator heist and absurd weapons (OST across heists also lacks the consistancy it had in PD1) . Game also has awful balance with many busted loadouts because of the huge amounts of weapons/skills available. To make it even worse they have recently made the game run like shit.

Honestly just play Payday The Heist if you haven't already, gameplay is massively more challenging than 2. It'll give you an idea of what Payday 2 could have been. Hopefully OVERKILL learn from their mistakes now that they have a fresh start with PD3."
"Congratulations, you managed to actually ruin the game... Post update 237 and it will never be the same again."
The vr support does not work for me am i the only one?
this shit fucking sucks lmao
Bought this game to play with my partner and it's literally unplayable. If I'd known the constant disconnecting was a known issue I wouldn't have purchased.
fuk you for ruining mods
so many bugs after 10 years of the game exist :(
Bought most of DLCs and have had a lot of fun but cant even launch the game anymore.
"Every game which will be free on epic games from steam will fall from a bike, and they done it with this game."
Mid mid mid mid mid boring spongy shooty repetitive shit
new update = cringe
no
this game makes me feel like ive been lobotomised. braindead game makes me want to shoot my friends in the back of the head for liking this poo poo ass game. 10/10 would recommend great game to start arguments with your friends. would rather play the bible on steam for 10k hours than this game for 10 more mins.
pay to win
"Matchmaking is fucked, don't bother with it right now if you're planning on playing with buddies"
The train mission is the worst thing anyone has ever created
"Was good,

Now its awful,

Greedy bastards."
"I fucking hate what they did to the game in u240.3. Why they couldn't just leave it as it is, now everything is broken and all the major changes that completely change the game are just unlisted. Do not get this game, I was right the first time. This game's golden age died out a long time ago and I doubt payday 3 is gonna ever get off the ground and above 1k players even if they gave it away for free"
great game but too unstable. One out of five games wont crash
amazing game!

Crashed on day 3 of the heist fuck this game

Took away everything from my save after years of not playing come back to a completely reset fucking progression. Eat a dick
"want a game that had a game breaking alteration for servers? you've come to the right place. with 86 hours on record i can say with great confidence that the move to transition servers was one of the best f**k ups i've seen in ages. Now i can't even join a match without desync. 10/10 would not recommend, will not be investing in PD3."
"I really, really want to say you should give Payday 2 a shot. I think it's a great game, with many incredibly fun gameplay moments. However, it may have some of the worst online play I've ever seen in a modern release. The matchmaking was recently gutted in an update, which allowed Epic Games players in to Steam lobbies. Cool and all, but it completely broke functionality.

 Equally, unlike a lot of online co-op games, the ENTIRE heist is instanced to the host's computer. Host crashes? You're out however many minutes you put into the heist. They have to leave, have network issues, or just flat out ragequit? Same deal. There's no swapping hosts, which has resulted in many a lost score and XP for me. Really hope they address multiplayer in PD3, since they have a great core game on their hands."
"Would i recommend this now? hell no payday 3 is around the corner
back in 2015? hell yeah that shit was cash money"
I bought the game solely for playing Co-op but I can't play any multiplayer. This game is a scam.
"Due to update 237 implementing Epic Game Store matchmaking (and by extention breaking the game due to how poor the coding is), I can't recommend Payday 2 for anyone. You need to pay 100+ dollars on top of the legacy bundle to get the full game with all its content. Overkill has botched the game and gone back on promises repeatedly. I don't even recommend Payday The Heist because Overkill isn't deserving of any money for their shady practices and utter incompetence with update 237."
"its alright but its a dlc based game, and theres like 80 dlcs so yea no"
"Failure to join or create games, fuck epic"
"shit community and full of bugs
and why does a town with a population of 50k has 3 billion cops?"
RUBBISH
"Recently came back into the game with another 250 or so hours dipped in and hundereds of achievements gathered, you'd expect me to say something positive but no.

The reason for this is that while I love this game and the mods it provides, I cannot state the fact that the recent update completely ruined matchmaking and multiplayer experiences for many players, including myself. Hell I even have trouble of joining some of my friends games. 

People for very good reason have even created mods that deliberately kicks EOS players out cause of Epic Games servers screwing up for the Steam players. 

If you truly want to support Payday 2, don't buy it on the summer sale."
"[b]3.5[/b] out of [b]10[/b] - [u]Good gameplay, horrendous multiplayer.[/u]

There were multiple instances where I had to restart the game entirely to get it to work. Player status in the lobby (between ""ready,"" ""not ready,"" and ""joining"") was sometimes inconsistent, and my friends would be met with black screens while I was able to load into the game. On the occasion that they were actually able to join, the NPC states weren't always the same--oftentimes they'd be frozen in place for one person while an assault was ongoing for the host. 

For this reason, this is one of the last titles I would recommend for a casual game with friends."
"The multiplayer is absolutely horrendous... Steam -> Steam play matchmaking with friends only is a chore to deal with EVERY TIME. Multiple issues with syncing between players, not loading in, freezing, other players not even seeing NPCs..."
"New updates are ass, should just wait for Payday 3 :,( Not even the summer sale makes this game worth buying."
"Update 237 makes multiplayer almost impossible to do now. It's been about a month and the issue still hasn't been resolved. It's basically unplayable in it's current state since multiplayer is where the majority of the fun is, and it's hard to have fun when connecting takes ages and then crashes while you're joining, and when you start a heist, and while you're playing, and pretty much all the time. Don't buy it until they fix it, enough said.

PS. Good fucking luck if you use Linux, it's been officially abandoned at this point even though it claims to still support it."
"Lost all my progress again because I reinstalled the game, because it wouldnt launch. I am pissed"
This game is for transexual homoerotic sissies who like BBC
Epic intagraeting fucked up matchmaking.. and broke things.. have to use launch aunments to get back to steam matchamking and even that don't fix everthing. so big fat NOPE.
doesnt fucking load
"Online is broken, this is due to EOS implementation for EGS cross-play being done poorly.  Either way, terrible experience, not even worth $1 if you intend to play with friends."
"great game all around, but allot of things are locked behind dlc..."
"Please, fix your game and unrelease from epic thanks"
"what have they done i can not play this game 
i did play it but now it just wont open and i would like some help 
can someone please explain to me why this game wont open i have tried everything to play this again 
but nothing works 
i love starbreeze best company since china"
cross play sucks

"A very enjoyable game with many glaring issues. The cost of entry is quite steep for new heists, the legacy collection is pretty good value and includes the majority of the best heists. The engine is really showing it's age from being pushed to its limits after 10 years, lots of crashes and annoying issues. Now has lots of server issues due to being forced to use Epic Online Services. Would give this a neutral review if I could. The game is fun and can still be enjoyed but a lot of their recent decisions feel pretty bad. I really hope that Payday 3 will be a fresh start and will be built upon a more stable foundation."
the game is good but everyone seems to really suck so it makes the team based maps impossible to play because this world is filled with literal idiots that buy a game and then have no idea how to play
"I have been a PD2 beta player in 2013 when it was released for beta and played when first launched for 150hrs . It was fine there and then , then came the dlcs after dlcs followed by the microtransaction debacle.
When i just started to play again on 1st Jul , with EGS having PD2 and thinking of buying the dlcs in bulk at $5 .
Guess what , Its unplayable now when combining with Epic Games PD2 lobbies , something about steam matchmaking was screwed after combining with Epic Games . 
To make things worse , i had so bad latency with my friends that i have a different phase from them . Eg . Us on a First World Bank Heist , they were already in escaping phase while i was still collect and grab the money phase.

It is recommended not to buy this game till they fix it . Cant believe it went to shit , from PD:the heist to PD2 then lastly worst in PD3 . 
Never going to buy PD3 as i have lost hope in the Overkill in a whole"
Too much dlc
"Ok, so I love this game. It's an incredibly fun horde shooter with great progression via the perks and skills to make unstoppable builds to fight the cop menace. But dear god, does this game have two blaring flaws. First, Starbreeze seems to be doing everything in it's power to break this game into a limbo of unplayability, and Second, most of the fun you derive from this game is roughly tens to hundreds of dollars of dlc. True, that isn't much of a problem recently, due to deals on the edition that basically gives you every dlc, but still, if a game needs dlc to actually be played in a fun way, then that's just not a game. Can't wait for Payday 3, though. It looks cool. Would just save up for that game instead. (Game sucks, Payday 2 is sadly still better)"
used to love the game but somehow they have broken the game recently actually crushed honestly. really wanna just play the game with mates but only run onto problems wtf did they do to ruin the game yikes. would recommend if game worked cos gameplay its a great game but now its just a broken mess.
This game's online is janky af now.
Ruined with update
Don't buy this now.  Since epic online services were implemented multiplayer is pointless.  Half the time you can't even join properly.  The other half you get stuck loading on a day 2 and have to restart if you are working your way through the career
"Thumbs down until they fixed the EOS integration issues and hosting-related crashes. Though with PD3 coming, I doubt they'll fix it."
playing with friends isn't fun
game just don't launch for some reason triied everything and it just don't even open a window when i click play
"Just mind boggling how in 2 updates im literally unable to start the game. Before, i could play it just fine, lobbies aplenty. 20-30 player lobbies all day everyday it seemed. Then the Update. Id see 5-10 player lobbies if im lucky. Also to mention, connection issues, it was problematic before the update. After just made it 10 times worse, felt like a gamble every time. Will i connect? Will i disconnect mid way through the game? Will i get kicked? Who knows, as im writing this, as i said i literally cant load for more than 5 seconds before the game crashes. Had fun with the game but i guess thats coming to an end. feels bad man"
ok game but they to MANY GOD DAMN DLC like you need dlc to use most thing in the game like i already 15 dollar to have stuff behind a pay wall
Every update breaks the game. It's quite annoying
Too few achievements
no for vr same shit over and over again  it sucks
Update 278 ruined the whole game
"This game is very fun with friends, I enjoy playing this with all of my buddies when we be heisting on them banks and sht yk what i mean dawg"
"since the last update the game's servers have become completely unusable, and hard crashes are extremely common. massive fucking shame since at any other point in the game's lifespan i would have gladly recommended it wholesale as it's really fun."
">84 gigs
>made in unreal engine
fun but leaves something to be desired in movement and gun play, left 4 dead is better."
"I just can't give this a good review with the random crashes in the middle of heists. It'll happen maybe once every 10 or 15 heists but, when it's in the middle of a crime spree and you lose 7 or 8 heists in, over a crash, it's unacceptable. I've also had tons of weird glitches like the bots just stop shooting people halfway through a heist and now I'm on my own for the rest or times where I'm doing stealth and one bot just walks around, following me the entire heist. OVERKILL is spending too much time making high priced DLCs and not enough time fixing their game."
"I love this game, played it on console for many years but the lack of support led me to play this on PC but as much as I love the game, the constant network issues that revolve around either constant disconnects or not able to even start a mission when everyone is clearly on ready.

shame that this game is in this state and I dont know if they'll ever fix it because of Payday 3 releasing."
not gud
"gmae was good, and i had it prefect......but then the devs got greedy and starterd to release a bunch of BS DLC, lets see how much of a trash fire the 3rd one is :/. only buy this game if its onsale and with a DLC pack,"
i wanted to say every argument but i am lazy so all i want to say is that this is trash and you better give away your 7 dollars rather than buying this shit
"OLD TIMES :nice cool game, very interesting, amazing, many weapons, cool missions, many items, awesome story, NICEEEEE!! SUPER FUN!! ---- SADLY THIS WAS BEFORE.


NOW: the game was cool, but sadly now i cant play with friends, to join with friends is a pain, sometimes cant join, and the game explode.  VERY DISAPOINTED .

to play with friends you need a code. A CODE THAT MANY TIMES,  ALMOST ALWAYS, NEVER WORKS.... VERY BAD DONE!!! 

this is a sad moment. A good game that was a lot fun, now it is broken."
"devs made an update that added crossplay with epic games store players but made the connection way worse, broke steam invites and took down linux support"
Update 237
"Epic games servers ruined the game. Literally cannot join freinds games and when you do, you get kicked from the lobby."
"The game is good if you are willing to fight against the bugs espatially if you want to play with friends.

DO NOT buy this game if it is not on sale, it goes on sale to around 80% if you want to pick a bundle the legacy bundle is the best value for your money for a lot of play time."
"Really?
On the last update you decide to fuck over the Steam and Linux users? for EPIC of all the useless platforms?

Just go to hell i'm done. PD3 looks bad and so you screw over PD2 to boost the sales huh?"
would not reccoemnd
"Can we appreciate how much effort epic games put into making Payday 2 lobbies glitchier than normal, thank you epic games"
dont buy it to laggy for my shit box
"really not fun, confusing and i fallowed instructions and now i have a life sentence in jail"
"This was a really good game and if they did not completely abandon payday 2 it would still be a very good game. Now, you can barely join into a heist with your friends, and god forbid you need to restart the heist bc now at least one person will need to leave and come back because the servers wont load. Now its to the point that for some of the heists, the objectives will not load into the game."
breakin feds
it's boring as hell after a while
"Can't smooth turn in-game, only 45 or 90 degree turns with a fade in and out black screen.

Nah I'm good thanks."
Fuck Epic for ruining yet another game.
"With update 237, they decided to drop Linux support and ruined the multiplayer by moving the online services from Steam to Epic Games' trash."
"Went from my favorite game to shit in record time
Not buying Payday 3 with the way things are going now"
"yes sure the guns are good, but the game its self is pretty ass, if you like stealth in games then don't play this unless your a god at it, the game is hard and all in all just not enjoyable, the difficulty to the impossible stealth I hate this game, you have to be really good at it if you want to play it, I hope this helped people."
Remove the Epic Spyware from our game
"It's almost impossible to reliably play online anymore, very cool"
literally unplayable until matchmaking gets fixed
"I absolutely love this game, but following Update 237, I cannot recommend it until the issues it has caused are fixed. Many are suffering from horrendous match-making, but I and plenty of others are unable to even start the game.

I have uninstalled all mods (as instructed), validated the game files (as instructed) twice, and even uninstalled and reinstalled the game, yet it still doesn't start.

Until I am able to do something as basic as boot up the game, this review will remain negative, regardless of how much I would normally recommend."
"End of support with badly implemented EOS was fucking mistake.
Some of troubles:
- Some mods dead, some mods crashing
- Invites not working for me 90% of time without any modes, or netcode is dead with modes (everyone ready - game isn't starting, peoples loaded on heist, but there have no connection to host, mission etc.)
- Save file corruption (luckely not for me)

P.S.
Really wanted to end with game with positive review, because i really liked this game, i had fun with friends, i have DSOD achievement, but whatever done is done. Hoping on fixes from devs, maybe will change my review.
P.P.S.
-steamMM fixed for me all bugs. My friend joined via CrimeNet, hosted on public. There are also fixed glitch, when friend is connected, but network freezing for him."
no sex DLC
cant play with my friends anymore and playing this game alone or with random is just ass.
"The Game is really good. 

But to much DLC"
"I don't like that the game i initially purchased (which happens to be the first ever game i got on Steam) has transformed into a sequel and is essentially not the game i initially bought.

Now I know that *technically* i didn't purchase the game but a license to it, meaning i'm ""not allowed"" to have a cry about it cause i knew the terms and conditions beforehand, but I'd be remiss in not acknowledging my frustration with it. It's bullshit."
"Just the same complaints as everyone else.

- Hostage/Team AI pathing is still as broken as fuck as it was on release (really? literally hundreds of updates but you guys can't figure out how to make a working npc pathing system, team AI will run out into the open and get downed instantly which is extremely frustrating and hostages will just refuse to follow you)
- Some maps were clearly untested before release and still haven't been improved (Brooklyn 10-10 is a perfect example as snipers will just straight up shoot you through walls, some of Locke's missions have guards walk straight through walls and doors like they don't exist).
- Stealth for the most part is fun, however the issue of pathing comes up again as guards will walk around in some of the most awkward and unnatural ways possible (walking backwards, getting stuck in animation cycles so they will just sit there and not move), after a while it takes you out of stealth and doesn't really keep you wanting to come back to those maps.
- Skills and perk decks are mostly fine and tuned really well... until whenever Overkill brainlessly adds another perk deck that invalidates all the ones before it by being the most OP shit I've ever seen (remember when Stoic was first added? It wasn't even the first time that happened LMAO)
- Some of the DLC content is just straight up scams, some are just recycled maps and assets from the main game with a new coat of paint slapped on it (It's so obvious at times that I literally see they took the warehouse from Election Day [day 2] placed it in Border Crossing and called it a day. Not to mention the other heist, Border Crystals, using the EXACT SAME FUCKING MAP but it's just Cook Off and with Locke voicing over instead of Bain. To charge money for what was essentially a repainted map is a fucking scam and Overkill should be embarrassed to even have the audacity to attempt that).
- The Epic Game Store (EGS) update completely broke the game making online play pretty much impossible and buggy. You can't actually copy and send the codes of your lobbies to send to friends making the entire system pointless. It wouldn't be an issue if the codes were short enough to quickly read them out to a friend over discord but instead they are paragraph long lines of mumbo jumbo. Imagine trying to get friends to join your lobby and having to read out what is essentially an elongated WiFi password every time. The whole update seemed to be rushed and just completely untested. Really not a good look for new players when they can't even play online.

Because of these gripes as well as the scummy treatment of this game from Starbreeze/Overkill, I can't legitimately recommend this to anyone without caveats. That being said I hope these issues are limited to this game only as Payday 3 looks to be very promising with the engine upgrade. If not, Starbreeze better be ready to go under because no one will stick around for this game anymore."
Dogwater devs
This was an amazing game when it came out. It quickly became a money grab scheme.
Remove Epic Games
Literally cannot copy and paste the required lobby codes to play with friends using a controller. It only works with KBM. Cannot invite Steam friends through Steam either. Not worth the hassle.

"Worst game ever,bad gameplay and unfun missions.Only plebs and slop enjoyers will like this."
no sex
Not interested
Can't even play online now although my internet is completely fine and files are not corrupted.
this fucking game not open 2 hour ı am going postal and broke my computer
shit game with shit matchmaking since u237. used to work like a charm and now me and my friends are crashing every 5 minutes with the heist restart mechanics and bodies are in completely separate places for each client instead of the p2p matchmaking of the game being stable. -steamMM is buggy and broken and is only meant to be a temporary solution for the problems steam players are facing and overkill and starbreeze are probably not going to make separate matchmaking for those who opt in. loved this game before the egs integration bullshit and now i can barely stand playing a simple shadow raid with a crew of 3.
"I love this game to death, and will probably pre order pd3,

Cmon, you can't just ruin this right before the next one comes out, its not like efforts going to be put into this game once payday 3 comes out, I planned on playing both until the end of time, I can't even open it :("
"Was playing this on release with friends and it was a cool game. Then dlcs start popping up, after first game i was thinking cool, more support for the product that i like, but after 10th dlc i stop buying them. Then they start sell weapons, skins, maps and music separately. Then they start to make bundles of dlcs. Then you can preoder dlc... Its gone insane...

Mod community was grate, a lot of cool mods that can make game a lot more interesting. But with every big update 50-70% just stop working and players have to wait until modmakers update them. And with some updates developers appropriate some mode ideas and alot of mode makers (especially with the hude) just give up.

Performance/optimisation with every new map got worse and worse. Maps was more and more less uniq and just more more recycling the assets... Music stay cool but developers doesn't make the music, they just choose/buy/licence it.

And now we at the point when they (devs/publisher) make cross play with epic game store and all my friend who still playing this game (i give up long ago) say that all mods just not working and game by it sellf barly playble with even save file corruption possibility.

With what they do to poor payday 2 and looking at other projects from starbreeze/overkill, have a little to no hope( if any) for payday 3. Music probably gona be cool tho!"
update 237 broke the game. eos sucks.
update 237 broke the game lol
"In the modern gaming industry, it really seems like a trend to broke and destroy older games with added third party crap. The new update replaced the peer to peer matchmaking with epic games servers which broke the multiplayer for many, it made the game drop native linux support, and the mods were broken by it. And for what? for a crossplay feature that literally nobody asked? for the insanely small amount of epic game users? and forcing players through epic game's service which is infamous for data collection without giving the option for the older matchmaking. And the devs couldn't do more than just simply lying on top of their past lies in every single of their news update. i hope it's worth it for them to ruin a 10 year old game that is literally at the end of it's life circle and dropping linux support for this..."
"bought the game before eBic games make it free to keep for one week and it's worse. hosts just leave the game way too often(loud heists as well). i wish i could wait a bit longer and get it for free on eBic games. it just no, as steam user, and payday 2 enjoyer."
Game constantly crashes mid heist
"Look man, I heard they changed the servers to epic for crossplay or some shit. I've seen crossplay integration kill like 5 games I liked by ruining the servers they gotta cut the shit. At least payday 3 is out soon"
"Game is fine, it's actually amazing!
But with the introduction of Epic Games serves, Steam servers have collapsed in on themselves and are hardly functioning. Why does a 10 year old steam game suddenly need to go to Epic? Good question.

Buyer beware, there is no easy way to buy the OVER 80 DLC. All provide some gameplay difference except the suit skins, which aren't even that good. Almost every heist DLC is worth it, though anything after White House, Nov. 2018, is kinda shit. Context: Starbreeze announced the end of development for Payday 2 after the release of the White House heist and subsequent end of the story. They would then go to finish The Walking Dead to critical failure, leaving them no option but to crawl back to Payday 2. The first dlc sold poorly because the community essentially said ""this is garbage, we expect better."" While the ones afterwards are ""fine,"" they're still worse than almost every Pre-White House heists. 

With all DLC, this game is over 90gigs. And with EGS servers, this game is breaking down and people are leaving. Either Starbreeze will get their shit together (unlikely) or multiplayer will die. Don't get me wrong though, this game is still a blast solo. EVERYTHING that can be done in multiplayer can be done in single player, so you won't miss anything. Except maybe a lot of cheaters and hosts kicking you because they still haven't figured out how to make a private lobby. 

Buy for the single player, hope Starbreeze gets a brain transplant and gets rid of EGS servers. 
Also you can cook meth as John Wick with Sicario, Scar face, and Jacket from Hotline Miami while fighting off hordes of police."
"Just one of those days that EGS woke up and decided to save the world again, but messed up everything as usual with their cursed money. Please remove this game from Steam. Go grab money somewhere else. You don't deserve any respect or support here anymore. Hope EGS bribe money worth it all."
"game broken :(
wait to buy until they said it fixed again"

"Great game to play with the boys but for gods sake remove epic games, literally makes the game unplayable."
"Bought the game for my friend im gonna run the story with him then the secret then im uninstalling forever fuck epic games 


2015 but worse"
ever since the newest update i'm unable to play with any of my friends and we tried multiple times to fix the problem but it doesn't work the only time we can play is by ourselves especially when we try to play in vr it's the same problem can't play with our friends
not my cup of tea
.
"MY SAVED GAMES AND ALL PROGRESS ALL GONE,LIKE WHAT THE F IS GOIN ON !!"
"Game was fun around launch and the first year. Mountains of DLC and paying for skins with stats turned me off from playing further, but now with EOS forcibly integrated I can't play it at all.

Absolutely scummy decision by a faceless company abusing its customers. I'm never going to buy anything else from Overkill, and I strongly recommend not to buy this game either. Whether you buy anything else from them is up to you."
"The game was great, but the Epic bribe money ducked the game. :)"
not interested really ...
"Epic Game Store and their forced Epic Online Services strikes again.

After 10 years of the game working great, they decided to swap to a laggier, buggier and just generally worse service - Epic Online Services - in order to receive EGS Bribes/to hand the game out for ""free"" on EGS.



Launch the game with the parameter ""-steamMM"" to return to the stable SteamWorks that was used for the past 10 years."
"I love PD2, just boycotting Epic Games. They've ruined countless games for me, and here we go again. Way to ruin an old installment just before releasing PD3."
trash
"Game was good, now so much is broken all because the devs wanted bribe money from epic.... it was fun while it lasted. Payday will never be the same."

"As of update 237, no longer functions. When you do manage to actually join a match, player is stuck in a ghost state. It's like I'm in my own instance separate from the host. Guards and cameras don't see me, doors I open aren't open for others, can't revive or activate objectives, civs or guards I shoot aren't dead for others. On their screen, I'm unmoving stuck in spawn, sometimes as a different character. 

Completely, radically broken. What did yall do?"
The latest update makes it no longer playable. It consistently desyncs already in the lobby and if you actually manage to start a game your teammates are standing at the spawn doing nothing and softlocking the game since they can neither do objectives nor can they even die.
They dropped the linux support.
"Newest update has caused all sorts of dsync issues. Disappearing medkits, frozen police AI, objectives not progressing at the same pace as other players. Hate how I come back to this game I love after a few months and now it's actually unplayable"
They ruined it.
"I loved payday 2.

i got into payday 2 after watching tones of videos about it so when the game went on sale i bought it and had the time of my life playing the first few heists.  A couple of weeks ago i decided to reinstall and play the game again and after setting my mods up i started to feel the same joy i felt when i first played. 
Then one day i could no longer open payday 2. i thought it was something on my end so i reinstalled the game, still didn't work. i did some research into my problem and found that the 237 update was stopping me from playing the game.  
I'm annoyed because i just want to play this game more yet overkill's choices wont let me.
please overkill. somehow just fix your shit without digging your hole deeper.
pre update 237 score: 8/10
post update 237 score: 0/10 because I cant even play the game.


UPDATE: i got the game working again but i had to uninstall all my mods otherwise the game crashes within 30 seconds. I'm not going to say ""Literally unplayable"" but i'm still disappointed."
"The Steam Version is dead, no linux compatibility anymore, VR doesnt work, dependent on Epic Game Store servers to play and in no way a funcioning game, report it to steam support. Ironically enough, Starbreeze robbed us, they had their Payday"
"Overkill the devs for Payday have ruined the game by swapping the online services to Epic Game stores trash servers. 

Game no longer works and when it does, it runs worse."
"GREAT GAEM
!"
2/10
"I don't care what others say but i find it so fucking hilarious and i quote ""PAYDAY 2 will finally spread its wings and soar to a new PC platform"" and they removed linux support like wtf hahaha that isn't adding that is removing
God that made me laugh so hard"
"played 1 mission and had alot of fun with my friend. Then we spent 45 mins or so trying to get into a lobby again together. twice we did that and honestly its kinda sad cause the game seemed fun, but their be more fish in the sea."
Newest update litterally broke my game lmao
"Used to be good, but they ruined the game eventually. No game that gets EOS survives."
Keeps crashing new update kill the matchmaking/servers. Cant even join my friends
"Yea this game was great prior to update 237, now it barely works.
Another game lost to Epic and greed I guess."
Linux support is gone. Can't play it anymore.
"Quantity over quality. More is not always better.

The good: 
The technical execution of the game. Graphics, sound, performance, stability, interface - all satisfactory. There are games with better technical execution, but what we have here is enough.
Initially the game seems to be a fun shooter.

The bad:
Too many DLCs.
The developers tried to make about guns and gun play by adding so many guns in the game, however gun enthusiasts might be left unhappy with the gun characteristics being SO FAR from reality. Dear developers, if you make a game about guns, FFS at least read about these guns on Wikipedia, it's free and accessible to everyone.

The ugly:
Too many enemies. They crawl like locusts, like ants from everywhere, they're not smart, not challenging about them beside their numbers, they spawn too often, with only a few seconds between the waves. Engaging them is not worth it half of the time, you kill a few behind you only so more can spawn ahead of you where you need to go. Battalions of enemies make it feel like the game is not about criminals but about all-out global war, killing the immersion.
Repetitive fetch missions: Collect the valuable items from another store, bring them to the van. Rinse. Repeat. Mow down another legion of ""locusts"".
The best missions are the ones from Payday 1. Payday 1 was better in any aspect: well-directed missions, actual tactical combat.
The game becomes annoying after a few hours of total gameplay, it feels like chore: go on, grind another dozen bags from a store, another few hundreds of mindless cop bots.

There is quote to decribe the game
""Trite, contrived, mediocre, milquetoast, amateurish, infantile, cliche-and-gonorrhea-ridden paean to conformism, affront to humanity, war crime, should *literally* be tried for war crimes, lacking in imagination, uninformed reimagining of [Payday: The Heist], limp-wristed, premature, ill-informed attempt at [copying Payday: The Heist], savagely boring, just one repulsive laugh after another."""
"Sold out their Linux players for Epic Game's money.  :(  
I guess I shouldn't be surprised, coming from a company that charges players for every update.

RIP Payday, you will be fondly remembered."
"THERE IS SH*T ALL OVER MY ROOM BECASE OF HOW HARD AND CONFUZING THIS GAME IS :(((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
THIS GAME IS WANK"
Its just not for me
"Utter trash: Main reason connection issues, i never used to have problems playing online, joining games, hosting games etc.
Ever since the Epic Update, nope, im lucky if one out of a hundred games will actually work, 90% of the time its due to someone in the lobby (even the host) stuck as joining or just straight up failed to join.
Tried this on multiple networks AND even mobile data and it has the exact same issue.
Like I said used to work fine, now just sucks ass."
fuck this game shlomit
i just dont know what to do
"After years of playing this game, It's officially reaching its end of life. I used to love this game but after overkill marking me as a cheater for having old mask packs, and now completely destroying the steam matchmaking and focusing Epic's servers, I've lost a place for this game. It used to be amazing with friends, and even with good/bad memories it was something for me to play for years on end. Now it's finally time to put it to rest. I fear what 3 may hold seeing as it's built on Unreal and most likely going to be manipulated by Epic at this rate. Thank you old Overkill and Starbreeze for the times way back then, but I can't hold out hope for this game anymore. After seeing dlc being spat out at rapid fire, and a terrible anti-cheat system, I'm done. I'm sad to not be able to recommend this game anymore but it is, what it is.

Here lies PAYDAY 2

Update 0.1 - Update 237"
"im no like it,,,. me and my friend was playinf ir was fine unrill tje game dusconetct me from the server and i goer gery ander so im dayibg rhis hniw do nor gfert this gamne,

Edit: Me and my fridns try to play and one frind try everything but it no let us play frick this game"
Boring.
not fun and to buggy
Spyware
ass
I got this game so I could play with my friends and enjoy my time. It was fun for a while but I can't exactly play with my friends now can I. One update to make the game free on epic games and make it crossplay and it all didn't work on steam.
Had fun for a long time then updates just prior to payday 3 came out. I havent played this game as much as the true veterans but with almost 300 hours dont play this or pay the huge amount to play. the servers and changed almost daily so cant play with friends (whole point of playing) and now the whole online doesnt work in general. Plus people try joining your game crash it causing you to loose all progress. this game once was fun but of course greed struck another company. sad to see another somewhat good company fail their long loving fans.
"very slightly fun, but more like just a bit entertaining... for like 20 minutes or so.  then boredom kicks in.  i wouldn't recommend it, but that's just me."
"Unplayable, every time I try to join my friends its either stuck on loading screen, either says failed to connect or just generally bugged 4 players in 5 player appears, cuz the original player is standing still at the same spot"
Shit
still unplayable w/ friends since epic games crossplay update.
"No, I don't like it. Pointless.."
"The game has been ruined by bad management, questionable development, and downright laughable community management. 

One of the recent updates to Payday 2 integrated their server system into the Epic Game Store. They said this wouldn't affect steam players, and they said this wouldn't affect the game in the long run. As of these updates, it is now almost impossible to find lobbies anymore. The game runs worse, server integrity is as bad as it can get, crashes are frequent, and the game somehow runs the worst it ever has in over 10 years of development. And with the most recent updates, save files have been getting corrupted, and people are loosing their savefiles permanently. This game has turned into a joke. A laughing stock, and a text-book case of how to not develop a game. Every update that's pushed out in a desperate attempt to save face, results in the game breaking down even harder. It's a house of cards that can't keep itself up anymore, and the game has fallen into a state of complete and utter breakdown. 

This EGS merger didn't have to happen. It has done nothing but break the game beyond repair, which goes to show how there truly is no limit to corporate greed. You don't know if the game will be playable tomorrow. If your savefile will still be there. If the game will corrupt or brick your PC. Every update is a coin toss, and the devs haven't been lucky so far.

Fix the game, remove the EGS cross-play, and let the game rest. It isn't worth ruining a decade long legacy in the making, only for a few worthless good boy points from Epic Games."
"This game is actually very good if you ignore the money hungry incompetent developers, the constantly coping community and the gameplay and the difficulty scaling and the story and the 10k DLCs and your own freewill.

edit: I also forgot the infamy 0 level 2 randoms who join your public death sentence one down stealth heist alert the whole map then ask if you could change it to bank: deposit on normal."
"I don't mind Epic Games, if someone likes this platform to play or to release games.
Just make sure it doesn't causes troubles to others. Let them choose who can join their game (enable/prevent players from other platforms maybe).
After your update my steam Payday 2 doesn't work anymore. I can't even launch it."
"10 years and all you can do is make the game run worse, truly a feat

after an entire summer, multiple ""fixes"" and looking up everything online, the game still refuses to launch
bravo, cant wait for payday 3 to run like a semi truck hitting an orphanage!"
fix crimespree
"Imagine breaking the matchmaking and other features 10 years after release just to get some players from the epic shit store, oh and also Linux support is dead, it's crazy how anything that epic touches, excluding unreal engine, ends up being trash, it really is the cancer of PC gaming.

Use -SteamMM save yourself some sanity."
"They completly ruined Multiplayer with the introduction of EOS, which is quite frankly hot garbage."
"I've thought a lot about this and I've decided that I'm going to have to go thumbs down on this one, which is a shame because there's actually a decently fun game buried somewhere underneath this disgustingly buggy pay to win grindfest. I'll keep this one brief but basically the monetization model makes no sense for this game. Every once in a while they make new weapons that you have to buy with real world money and they just won't stop doing it. Making players pay actual money for upgrades in a videogame is stupid! I get that if you go ahead and make a whole new map that I have to pay extra for that because it's like bonus content or whatever, and I like that only one player in your party needs to own a DLC level for you to be able to play it, but I just can't excuse the rest of it. On top of that they use scummy tactics such as delisting some of the DLC so that you only have a limited time to buy it before it goes away FOREVER. It is not worth playing this game anymore and Payday 3 is probably going to be more of the same. You have to shell out so much cash for access to the good loadouts that it's not even funny."
DLC
A shell of its former self
"They fucking ruined it.
God damnit"
"EOS matchmaking is a fucking joke, good job epic games, you guys successfully ruined this game."
"90% of the game now is either playing solo or ""failed to join session"". untill they fix it its not worth it."
Less than mid
Just wanted to come back to this after a few years of not playing the game to say that since OVK has taken the EPIC money and fucked the game for everyone who isnt a epic shill. 237 is what payday 3 will likely turn out to be.
Repetitive and awkward. The best thing about this game is that its soundtrack is available as a mod for Deep Rock Galactic
"Reinstalled after a long, long break to see if there were any signs of Overkill taking this game in a better direction before Payday 3 comes out. Greeted with there being over twice as many DLCs to buy, laggy servers, broken matchmaking, corrupted saves, broken mods, crashes, disconnects, people being flagged as cheaters for having too many DLCs and/or owning certain weapons/mods... 

....yeah, I think I'll pass on that sequel."
This game is a nightmare to run every time I just want to play the game I need to uninstall and re download it after every update go to YouTube its 2023 and they are still having glitches appear now the game wont launch I swear these people are just as bad as Bethesda.
"I played this game once, didn't like. Now Steam won't stop making recommendations based on it. It's infuriating. I've tried removing it from my account, didn't stop it. Now I hate this game way more than it deserves. Still not great"
"Thanks to the g̶r̶e̶e̶d̶ brilliance of devs deciding that moving the match making servers from Steam to epic was the way to make this game even more fun, I now can't connect to my friend's games."
Not worth playing at all until they fix the matchmaking issues since 6/7/2023.

"Can't believe this happened. PAYDAY 2 free on epic store? For a WEEK?
Overkill, u know that u fucked your own game by doing that?

I used to like this game, but after this bullshit, bruh, No Thanks.
I'm still playing this game, because i'm waiting for PD 3, but nah.

Connection problems, failed to join, no more good DW or DS lobbys, sometimes it shows 0 of them. 
Now it's just nerds playing (sorry) but this is just so bad, new players, normal diff lobbys, and most important More CHEATERS. Actually, there's MORE than more cheaters, like, in every lobby. 

Now how i'm playing this game is... with friends and other payday 2 players that i know, and it's all good. Sometimes shit happens when i'm trying to join them, but it's not that bad as lobby searching. I don't even want to talk about that update lol.

So long story short, this game is fucked, even payday 3 is coming, i kinda lost my hype for it because of this bullshit.
and yes, new players, epic nerds.. Don't join DW or DS lobby (EVEN IF IT'S STEALTH) because y'all annoying, watch some tutorials on Youtube or something when u UNDERSTAND THIS GAME MECHANICS. The OG players are abandoning this game, there will be no good side of this game, this is the END, and thanks to Epic Games for destroying this game.

""ngl this the biggest comment i've ever writed, it's not fun anymore bruh, wtf overkill is even thinking"""
dead game
"The game is broken and will no longer launch for me, now as the only game in my steam library i can't play."
"one of my favorite games just no longer launches, nice one guys"
THIS GAME IS SO AWFUL I CANT FATHOM HOW AWFUL AND TRASH THE GAME ISFROM THE MALIGNANT GAURDS TO THE DOG SHIT SYSTEMS FOR BEING DETECTED LITTERALY I GET DETETCED WHEN MY CHARCTERS BAWLZ ARE SLIGHTLY OUT TRASH DOSGHIT GAME
The devs broke a 10 year old game with an update that was entirely motivated by profit. Multiplayer is now largely unplayable with no fix documented. Do not support these people in taking more money from the community with their bad practices. Look forward to these issues never being resolved as the devs disappear with the release of payday 3.
"Fuck update 237 it kinda destroyed the game i played this game a lot on steam and even the ps3 versions there were a lot of bugs before but this fucked everything Epic games is a plague only for a few extra players that probaby be bored asf after a few days without buying the dlcs 
i lost all the respect for the creators of this game and i wont buy payday3"
"This is a steam game, and I can't go online because EOS is down. This sucks."
"Since the Epic Crossplay was introduced, I have not been able to play with my friends at all and sometimes failed to play online at all. Randoms either being locked in the joining screen or me being the one locking them in one, no way for the host to kick or leave until the person joining leaves first. About 1/3 of all online games that I have played had this issue and I will keep this review up until they fix it. 

Great game apart from the recent issues."
"When your connection to the host fails, you automatically lose the entire heist and all the time put into it."
"I tried to get a online game running with 2 friends and this is a list of errors we encountered:

- Unable to join lobby
- Unable to join already running games
- Players randomly disconnecting from lobby
- Game doesn't start, even if all players are ready
- Not all players from lobby that are ready get into the game. Some stuck in Lobby.
- Blackscreen after gamestart (Inifinite Loading)
- Lobby Invites are missing
- Random Game crashes

Every lobby recreation drains the bank account. After a few attempts nobody in my group had enougt money to setup a job anymore.

I hope devs do better with Payday 3."
"f*ck epic games!
GET BACK STEAM NETWORK API !
* Most mods is broken or cause bugs and crashes in game.
* Even without mods! Lobbies works terrible, either I can’t join someone, or people can’t come into my lobby or if they can, they have black screen. I am sure that most of the problems are related to the new network code from Epic Games.
* They stop Linux support! I'm sure they did it because Epic Games didn't want to make their network API library for Linux! They are not Linux friendly."
"They broke it, and im not buying the 3rd game till this is fixed, just goes to show that Overkill doesnt really care about its community IE lemme break my cash cow right before our next game comes out in hopes the players from 2 with all its bloated content to get on 3 with its bare bones launch. spent way to much money on this just to have somebody break it. never again overkill."
no way they keep pushing back this release date and wont even work on making this game functional.. its obvious their priorities are not us.
"Absolute trash, the game is bugyy as hell, security officers notice you through walls and ring the alarms. also there is absolutely no intructions as to what is todo, in the2 first mission where you have to rob the car dealership, there is no instructions as to how to get the manager to give you the key card or where you have to go..

ABSOLUTE BULLSHIT GAME, DO NOT BUY!!!"
"Me and my friends redownloaded this game in anticipation of payday 3, little did we know the update from 5 days ago made it so buggy that games with friends straight up don't work. Literally unplayable"
game bad
"Yeah, no, I can't in good faith recommend this game anymore.

Payday 2 is an amazing game and for the price of it, and for how often it's on sale, it genuinely provides a good bang for it's buck, with hundreds of hours of content. Back when I didn't have much money to spend on games, this was an absolute godsend due to it's seemingly endless amounts of content. But that's when the game works.

Despite saying that PD2 will no longer receive updates, and even announcing a final update before the launch of PD3, Starbreeze have been updating the game still without any announcements, re-balancing things that didn't need re-balancing, and overall just making unnecessary adjustments. Perhaps when they meant not receiving updates they meant no new content, and only bug fixes, but these secret updates have brought in a myriad of bugs into the game, a Youtuber called Marcmb documents a lot of the bugs, and I'm just highlighting some particularly noteworthy ones.

One of the bugs is Stealth breaking, the NPCS in stealth can be frozen now permanently, which can potentially, if unlucky, softlock a heist, this bug has completely changed stealth, as it only hurts the honest player who wants to play the game as intended, and it only strengthens the people wishing to take advantage of exploits, and this bug, when exploited, makes some of the hardest stealth maps completely trivial. One of the two ways of playing the game (stealth or loud) just doesn't work as intended anymore, which is peachy, it's also worth mentioning that spawn patterns for Loud are bugged aswell and they don't work as intended anymore so both methods of play are bugged in some fundamental way (although loud is a lot less noticeable and a lot more manageable than stealth's bugs)

Another particularly annoying bug is a very recent one, the community item bug. In PD2 there are some weapons, masks and a few other bits and bobs that you get from either joining the PD2 steam group, or making a starbreeze account. Multiple people, including me, have logged onto the game just to find those items getting removed, this wouldn't be a particularly bad problem if one of the best weapons for stealth ""The Judge Shotgun"" is locked behind the community item list. The ""fix"" to this is to leave and rejoin the steam group everytime this happens, but from my personal experience this happens everytime I log into the game, or even when I finish a heist it can sometimes happen. So if you're doing some stealth heists, be prepared to possibly go to the steam page to unfollow and refollow the group every single time you finish a heist, and let's say you have the game downloaded and you're without internet (e.g travelling and playing on a steam deck), you wouldn't be able to use the unfollow and refollow method and those items will remain locked for you.

Most payday 2 players probably aren't even bothered by this, not because it's not a big deal, they're just used to it, the community has found ways to mitigate it, both in-game and using third-party mods, but that's no excuse for the developers not fixing the game to be functional. It's just really frustrating to have starbreeze retroactively ruin their own game for seemingly no reason, and it looks like they're not gonna fix these bugs either as they continue working on the sinking ship that is PD3. Especially when they could seemingly just rollback the updates back when the game was in a functional state, which wouldn't remove any content. This review is more for the people who are thinking of getting into PD2 more than anything.

It's a great game, genuinely a lot of fun, both playing with friends and playing on my own, but in it's current state it is really poor, there are a lot more bugs I have not mentioned. On top of egregious amounts of DLC, Multiplayer being populated by cheaters (with no anti-cheat), the Epic games matchmaking integration fiasco, some people's save files (which they've spent hundreds of hours on) just getting erased, random crashes, bugged out physics. Don't give your money to these devs who are just gonna make the game worse and then not fix it, they're only focused on fixing up Payday 3 to the standard it should have been at on release, which, despite not being up to standards, they're already pumping out paid DLC for."
poisoned by Epic Games
blogis
worst fps
better than the sequel (finally got 1k hours yay) (also buff maniac and hitman pls i beg)
Remember when you could play online on Linux?
i love this game (release my family please)
sold out to epic and ruined the steam version get fucked dev's hope your greedy ass company fails
"After U237, this game has lost any and all interest in being a functional piece of software. I don't know what sort of drugs Starbreeze and OVERKILL were on thinking that breaking a game with a decade's worth of generally always working for a shitty storefront and player base that doesn't even buy their games through a service that never seems to work at all, let alone correctly. Due to this, I have zero plans of ever buying anything else from Starbreeze/OVERKILL, and I do wish them the best in their efforts to stay afloat.

However, 236 and earlier, great game. Good fun, even with power creep and weird janky heists that sometimes has some funny moments because of the Diesel engine. Gonna miss it."
"Ever since release the game has felt like an unfinished product. There is minimal polish, bugs and issues that have existed since launch that I can only assume are ""features"" now.

Out of nowhere they've now forced everyone onto Epic Game Servers as well, so enjoy the spyware that comes with that.

Barely functional. Will never be fixed. Not touching another product made by this company if this is the best they can do after years of development, and I've been here the entire time."
THIS IS SO FUCKING BROKEN SINCE IT GOT ADDED TO THE EPIC STORE. DONT BUY UNTILL IT GETS FIXED. When the game crashes it doesnt go back to your home screen it just stays fucking up until you turn of your computer
"This is a heist simulator 2013. 

It is not a game. It is not even a play.
And it doesn't increase real money. So there is no fun.

Do not buy it."
Bad game
no linux support
"I've played this game for quite a while, and have enjoyed my time with it.
Very recently though, some incompetent people at whichever side decided that implementing cross-play with Epic Games is important, which is good conceptually. More people get to play the game, and for free too.
It'd be all well and good if it weren't for how absurdly awful its implementation is though.
Constant crashing, people's save files corrupting, barely being able to join heists, Terribly done invite systems that worked fine before, and so on.
OVERKILL has come back from similar blunders, and I believe they're able to do it again,
but in its current broken state, I cannot at all recommend this game to newer players.
It'll definitely take some time to fix, especially with all the people who I assume were moved over to the PD3 team. It's really just the perfect storm of terrible things.

If it ever does get fixed, then it'll be worth playing again."
Bain cant cum
Stop giving games aids by adding egs support
s​hit game
237
game does not launch even tho i have done everything to fix it but you can try and play it
Unplayable in multiplayer
Made the game harder to play on steam cause epic paid them big money to do it
Single highhandedly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ its content by making multiplayer epic games locked on steam. Dlc locked content is also a massive turn off 2/10 game
Single highhandedly fucked its content by making multiplayer epic games locked on steam. Dlc locked content is also a massive turn off 2/10 game
I didn't think it was possible to get a majority of the player base to stop playing in a single update but here we are.
"Was a really fun game to play with friends, that I have a lot of good memories of, but the online play with friends is incredibly tedious being disconnected 1-3 times per heist, and the online matchmaking being a joke, if this gets fixed I can say that it is a really good game, but untill it is, the game is not playable outside of a singleplayer campaign"
Buggy
240.3 broke the game again.
"While previously the game was a bit buggy, until the game is fixed following the epic games update its gonna be literally unplayable for some players, besides the bugs being a massive problem I otherwise recommend the game, because before the update, it was very fun and sometimes the bugs were even funny, but now it may not even boot at all due to bugs depending on the player's setup, so for that reason I can not currently recommend the game in this state"
I cant even start the game dont buy it
Amazing game when it first came out. Got flooded with bad DLCs as a money grab and is now unplayable. Payday 3 is 40€ preorder but you can also preorder for like 90€ the gold edition including a season pass with weapons and maps. In short if you buy the normal version you do not purchase the full game as you do not get access to content updates. you will have to pay twice the money for that. So payday 3 will start as bad as payday 2 ended. Realy sad.
"deadgame 2 and now their releasing deadgame 3 for 4x the price, if i see even 1 dlc for it its going to be a hard pass, which seeing how this game currently has 82 dlc's im not even going to add it to my wishlist"
I LIKE SERVERS
"The update is still there, waiting to be installed, and it's gonna stay there.

I don't want my antivirus berating me for downloading anything epic related, specially when it fucks shit up."
"Starbreeze and massive mismanagement.  It is just fitting like Sega and mismanagement, EA and anti-consumerism, and Randy Pitchford being a massive lying scumbag.

As many of you know, Update 237 broke the game completely.  No more mods (especially the useful quality of life UI ones), a lot more crashes and loading issues, weapons went missing, no side job rewards system, oh and the two most important issues:  No more Payday 2 for Linux users (abandoned Linux support), and matchmaking system is broken, so you can't play the game online it seems.  A co-op multiplayer shooter where you can't play the game online!

But the worst part?  We should have seen this coming, since Starbreeze has a history of mismanagement and bonehead decisions.

Here's a bit of a history lesson:

- Despite being rushed out in an incomplete state, Payday 2 is still one of the best selling games on Steam, somehow.

- Company makes a ton of money, value of your company rises in the eyes of investors.

- Best selling game = Bo Andersson's ego massively inflated!  AND HERE COMES THE BONEHEAD DECISIONS.

- PS3/XBOX 360 versions rarely gets updates, leaving the console gamers behind with an out of date game, and shows signs that the development team are having issues with updating the game for those consoles.

- Bo Andersson wants a new game engine.  Pays $8.6 million on the Valhalla Engine, despite the engine basically being nothing but scripts and no development tools, and shows no signs that this is an actual functional game engine!  https://www.gamedesigning.org/engines/valhalla/

- Announce a big title game using a huge IP: Overkill's The Walking Dead.  This uses Valhalla Engine.

- Overkill devs find out Valhalla is nothing but scripts and no development tools and to get Overkill's The Walking Dead in a functional state, Overkill switches to Unreal Engine 4....with around 6 months left until the release date.

- Overkill's The Walking Dead releases in an insanely broken and buggy state missing basic features like keybinding.

- The Walking Dead co-creator Robert Kirkman is (rightfully) FURIOUS.  Revokes Starbreeze's license to use The Walking Dead.  Game gets shut down and removed from Steam.  Console versions cancelled.

- MEANWHILE AT PAYDAY 2....

- Microtransactions!  Just ignore the fact that we said in the past that there will be no microtransactions!

- Despite what Reddit and other gaming media idiots say:  The microtransactions information gets leaked by not only one, but TWO Overkill/ex-Overkill devs on a Payday The Heist /vg/ thread on 4chan  (I was in the thread, so I know about this and remember this.)

- Fans boycotts.  Eventually microtransactions changed so you don't need a key (or drill in this case) to open skin cases.  Acceptable compromise.

- Console versions?  Those who bought the game for PS3 and XBOX 360 will now have to upgrade to the PS4 and XBox One versions to get all of the latest content....oh wait it's still out of date, you need to buy an update pack in the future to keep the game updated with all of the DLCs.  And the game on PS4 and XBox One seems to suffer from slow downs.

- Whoops, we can't support the console versions anymore.  Tough luck console players!

- End Payday 2 development in 2018.

- Company is broke, bring Payday 2 back into development and release more DLC!!

- MEANWHILE AT STARBREEZE...

- Bo's brother, Ulf (the face and voice of Wolf in Payday 1 and 2) has enough of the bullshit and leaves Overkill to start his own company.

- Bo continues to overspend Starbreeze's money.

- Spend money on a failed VR headset that was inferior to the other VR headsets out there.  This fails.

- Spend money on opening a VR theme park in Dubai.  This also fails.

- Spend money and fund ex-Overkill devs' game RAID: World War II.  It's Payday but in World War II, with John Cleese of Monty Python!  The game sucks.  Oh and that other game that was announced years ago called ""Storm""?  That's now dead too!

- Bo eventually blames The Walking Dead's fisaco on the devs for being lazy, even though the devs had to work with an impossible deadline, an engine switch, and other company mismanagement.

- Bo continues to blame everyone but himself and his own stupidity.

- Bo eventually gets charged and arrested for insider trading.  Starbreeze is in the hole.  Gets restructured.

And that pretty much covers it.  All of these bonehead decisions and company mismanagement shouldn't surprise anyone, including loyal Payday 2 players.

Update 237 is just another decision that ended up killing Payday 2 and quite possibly the Payday franchise along with it."
"1.bad connect i with my friend to play this game but cant connect,ovk use the epic server in steam
2.sometime maybe i cant play whit my friend he Next to me but he cant join game

"Absolute trash game.
The servers suck ass.
I raged so badly I made a hole in my table.
I hate this game soo much.
I just to like this game and I was good at it and now after few years I came back to play it and its the worst game I have played.
I hope payday 3 is better."
"game straight up just doesnt launch,please revert the 237 update :("
"This is a live service game with a sequel on the horizon. By the end of 2023, it will be as dead as the dodo - and the single player experience is very weak.

If you're considering getting into this, wait for Payday 3."
bring back the musket
"Dogshit game, stinks"
"U237 f--ked everything up, from multiplayer mode to support for GNU/Linux. Can no longer play Multiplayer: joining lobbies always fails and hosted lobby won't get anyone joined. Playing on GNU/Linux is now severely impacted, no longer receive updates and only singleplayer mode, which is f--king ridiculous."
"when a random has a red laser, and i get downed, i can say there was a sniper behind me"
used to be one of my favourite games but the new update wiped my save file
"Came back after a couple of years after learning that the base game was free on Epic and hoped to play with some new people from other platforms: 
Much to my surprise I came to find an absolute clusterfuck update that slows down and clumsies the few aspects of playing online that it doesn't break.
Also, most EGS players oftenly turn out to be absolutely lost by the mechanics of even the menus. I expect a level 5 player to spent half an hour browsing through his inventory, skills and preplaning for a ""Four Stores"" Heist, not a level 50 like I've found. Hope this situation is reverted or at least we are given the chance to only get into Matchmaking with Steam players."
nie chce sie wlaczyc chujstwo
RIP Payday 2
Dont play this game from today on its just a scam for any new players they just sold theyr game out to epic games and called it a update237 if u think my review is overreacting i recommend you to see further reviews from wich ae posted after update 237
"dont buy it if u dont want to play it on vr. 
also on vr the graphics  are very low, but its still a bit fun.
wait for payday 3"
Added EOS.
Connection to the host has been lost.
"GET THE FXXKING RANGE FILTER BACK, WTF WAS WRONG WITH YOUR BRAIN TO COME UP WITH SUCK MISERABLE IDEA TO CUT IT OFF???"
"ITS BEEN 10 YEARS for this game to be good back then but right NOW THE DEVS F*K it up CAN'T play with Friends anymore
Great JOB Overkill by teaming with EPIC
Mods = Broken
Matchmaking/Playing with Friends = RUINED
Damn you EPIC GAMES.
I hope you don't Make PAYDAY 3 Garbage when released.
Edit: Theres a Fix for this but is kinda complicated. Just search in the Internet"
Fuck u epic
Update 237 killed this game. EOS is trash. (I will remove this review if/when the recent changes are fixed/reverted)
I can barely find lobbies after epic games update.
"I bought payday 2 on STEAM, I want my steam features, I don't care about more public players, I play with my stream friends and that functionality is now so broken its not even funny.

When I only care about playing with friends, breaking the friend system is a big deal. I wish I could refund this game, I would have never bought it in this state. its bullshit that they can ruin games with mandatory patches after I buy it."
"game is unplayable since last update with epic crossplay. Nothing works and when i say nothing, i really mean nothing being able to  start a game or join some lobby sounds like miracle.Not even talking about people's loosing their thousands+ hours accounts bcs of stupid save files corruptions, luckily i had backup of mine

game was really good back then tho, i mean there was lot of bugs and things like that, but all of us got used on it, it was not big deal. 

Hope devs will wake up soon and they'ill get rid of that stupid epic or atleast they will fix all these problems

FUCK EPIC"
"Literally can't play, it's too broken. Lobby frequently bugs out, someone has to rejoin to get it to work all the time. If host bugs then the entire lobby is screwed. Players get stuck loading in, Ready-up status doesn't sync properly half the time, using -steam and -steamMM causes steam invites and joining off steam to fail, so it's very difficult to play with friends without dealing with their failure of net code.

Edit: They fixed the lobby code burn-in at least :p"
Remove EOS
videogames suck
"I used to play this game a lot with friends; despite the jank and loading issues at times, I had a blast especially then, and I still liked returning to this game to play a round or two, and it's good enough fun. However, the last four or so times i've tried to play over the last several months, the game simply refuses to load; re-installing, clearing cache, removing all mods, running in different windows modes, there's no fixes I can find anywhere that've worked and honestly despite the time played, I'd rather just leave it uninstalled. Maybe payday 3 will fucking work properly lol, I have nostalgia towards it but if I can't play the game for this long, I just can't recommend it to anyone"
"This game has been a favorite of mine for a long time, sadly with the release of u237 i havent been able to open the game."
game sucks
"What a way to ruin a good game.

For anyone wanting to buy this game, just save yourself and your money. Don't give more to this greedy company"
"I do and I dont recommend the game. I do recommend the gameplay, story, and gunplay. It is a genuinely fun game. 

There is one bug that is making me not recommend the game. It can not, and will not capture my mouse. Ive tried FOR YEARS to fix it. Ive googled every variation of the issue i can think of. If you go google something to try to find a solution, I promise you, Ive already seen it. Ive reinstalled. Ive verified the files. Ive reinstalled my OS, Ive used intel processors, Ive used AMD processors. I have used the integrated GPU and Ive used dedicated GPUs. 

No change on my end makes the mouse capture in the window. Not the cursor, that captures just fine. The X and Y position of the mouse isnt captured. I have three monitors. With the game open, if I move the mouse to the right, the cursor remains within the bounds of the game window, but the OS still registers the mouse as over my discord window and lets me scroll through discord. This happens in game too! Ill be filling a bulldozer with lead, and then ill bump the scroll wheel and I see discord scrolling. 

Someone at starbreeze, please message me and let me help you fix this. This has been plaguing me for at least a few years now.

Again, Ive tried every remedy on google. I will buy someone Payday 3 if they have a fix that is permanent and not a kludgy temp fix. I want to be free of this curse."
"can't join sh*t, f*ck this update and f*ck cross play"
"wont even open anymore, thx for epic integration tho"
Game just doesn't even work anymore
countless DLC's and they still went for more money. greed killed this game
"Ruined the game functionality by suckling Epic Games. Epic is a cancer for games and fuck the devs for again, screwing the community."
"Weeks ago I d recommend. [b]Now I do not[/b] due to recent game breaking changes, desicion to infest this game with EOS spyware (which it is not even marked on Steam store page at the time of writing this review) and idiotic decision to merge Steam and Epic multiplayer. 👎👎👎"
"I really enjoyed this game, and while I can understand the reasoning for pulling native Linux support, I strongly believe that this was a bad move. Especially during the better era of gaming on Linux and how far the Steam Deck has come, even with tools like Proton that provide a compatibility layer for non-native games, the need for native ports is still here."
"The game was fun. Now it's a mess. I never played the multiplayer post 237, but I saw memes. What makes this worse is that the controller layouts for the Steam Deck no longer work. I really hope this gets fixed, since my PC can't run this."
"it's really fun for a few hours,  its just not my type. And with payday 3 on the horzion, i would look more in that direction than this one."
"Finding a loud DS lobby is next to impossible, good job with 237"
"get f**k as ps3/ps4 player with crimewave edition with lack of updates, then turn to PC version and just get f**k again with u237, thanks overkill...."
"The game now uses Epic Games Service's for matchmaking, making it unplayable in multiplayer."
"I Cannot recommend this game anymore  Game was fine as it was then they pulled the run out from under Linux players banned Russians from Buying Payday 3 cause suddenly the people of Russia are at fault,and then made this Rely on Epic Games store for their servers who are known to be shady bastards when it comes to Data. Since this latest update I've stopped playing Entirely Fuck Epic Games Viva La Steam"
"Good job, random and sudden reliance on Epic Online servers destroyed the game. Was selling out to the EGS for free release really worth trashing the ability to play on Steam?"
"did a fresh install of the game and it doesnt even launch on startup lol, thanks overkill"
Epic Online Services were added compromising experience of Steam userbase so that they get to give the game away for free on EGS.
"If they drop Linux support, I drop my support. I feel like it's an equal trade :)"
"While at it's core it was a fun game, and it had so much potential on release. It's been a good few years since that, nowadays the game is bloated and constantly mismanaged by incopetent devs. The lastets cross play update is a good example of, but not the only one. Knowing overkill they will never get the game into a good shape again, and they should be given no attention for payday 3, it's just going to go down the same route."
"Switched over to EOS (Epic Online Services), broke plenty parts/features of the game.
Noone asked for this, consumers are NOT benefiting from this. Opposite in fact, as some downgrades were introduced, making features worse.

Shameful and disgusting move by dev. Definitely not gonna redownload the game, since I don't want to install malicious spyware on my system that is proven to check files it has no right to touch.

For an in-depth look at the situation, I refer to this amazing review: https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaco909/recommended/218620/"
"Loved this game to bits, and still to at some points, but now it's just sad. A dev who cares jack-sh*** for its fans and gives the game to a scummy other dev to ruin it. If u guys are smart, you will stay away from the game and it's future releases until Overkill finds its common sense again and rollbacks the sh***show that is their latest update. 

Say no the Update 237 and say no to the scumlords that are EpicGames!"
must das sein
"goodbye payday. 
you had a good run.
screw u237 and eos.
somehow managed to destroy a 10 year old game in a single update."
Can no longer play this game due to latest update.
why do game devs think it's a good idea to add dumb stuff to a already good game and kill it. Like with EOS Epic Online Services which is messing up multiplayer
"Linux support has been spotty for a while now but not only have they completely dropped support but they broke the windows version too, a bunch of my progress got recent, and for what? Being put on epic? What a joke

Payday 3 is already showing a god awful microtransaction system too, don't give this company money"
"I love PD2 its the main reason  why I got a Gaming laptop but for some reason i can't start it and it wont open up wtf!    
how can you ruin something at was already perfect and *knock on wood* if payday 3 fails what then!! your money maker PD2 is broken on steam Its going to get review bomb to all hell. Its a sad day to a game you love die."
Not good game. Tried to play with friend who had this game on steam and i had it on epic. didn't work .kept crashing.
This game was fun at one point. It's sad to see the developers treat the player base so carelessly. If you have been playing this game on steam since launch and purchased the dlc along the way it can't feel good. I'll personally be passing on PayDay 3 due to how the developer is treating this game.
-removed linux support and made it platform exclusive (windows)
"I bought the game years ago, and now it doesn't show up in my library and I have to buy it again to play? lmao, okay."
"The new update 237 just destroyed the game. My payday 2 isn't even launching i thought it was a game with really big potential (it was) but i guess i was wrong :/ and for those who are wondering i did everything to get my payday 2 but it's not working so basically i bought a game which was cool until this update which introduce Epic Games Players. I do not think that this was a great idea, for what i'm seeing in youtube matchmaking in steam is completely dead, mods are dead too some people lost their rewards from the side jobs. For now i won't recommand this game and i'm starting to think Overkill is a money industry, so sad for a game with so much potential.... :/"
"Came expecting some sort of tactical, strategic, realistic shooter where I got to rob banks. 

Instead I got some arcadey, repetitive shooter where literally hundreds of identical enemies stream towards you from the same choke points in endless waves. 

And the DLC.....my god, the DLC. 80 pieces of DLC totalling $370 dollarydoos, seriously? Talk about flogging a dead horse."
You should've just made the game free discounted on Steam. That would've been much easier for everybody than trying to sell out to Epic.
"Requires downloading Epic Game's EOSDK to play online, forcing you to use Epic Games' servers instead of Steam's servers for matchmaking. EOS is notoriously unstable when it comes to performance and has major security risks being owned by Tencent. Overkill is on record flat out lying about this stating that we will not have to download the EOS or any 3rd party tools, but when the new update released EOS was secretly installed as part of the game now. 

EOS is NOT listed as being required in the EULA.
EOS is NOT listed on the Steam store page as being required.
EOS was NOT going to be installed according to Overkill, which we now know is a blatant lie.
EOS is NOT wanted. Remove it."
fix online service
not Team fortress 2 :(
Overkill broke their game by shilling out to EPIC games.
im joining the overkill hate train because they broke their game
"better matchmaking than pd3 ill give it that
and also better launch"
"Nope, needs remake/remaster desperately :/"
rip payday
"Game literally sold it's soul for free to a launcher that no one willingly uses because it is in every way worse than steam and the only reason anyone uses it at all is either for Fortnite or free games. Steam version literally does not launch at all, Linux has been cast into the fiery depths of hell with the console version and Overkill has show their incredible ability to completely fuck up such a sound and very well made game. If update 237 ever does somehow get fixed or just entirely revoked than i would recommend this game, but I'm sure they're probably stuck in a contract with the leech that is Epic Games so I wouldn't get my hopes up."
I cant even start the game up after the new update i looked up every tutorial and tried everything from reinstalling too moving files and the game just wont start up... i downloaded on epic games but all my progress and DLCs are gone so many hours and  just wasted. this was always one of my favorite games of all time and now i cant even play it anymore....
"I’m surprised that this game is so good, despite the stupid decisions of the Developers and Publishers. The direction and decisions of the company are a senseless mess, it almost seems like you want to sabotage your own damn game with every decision. Now not only do the mods not work, but you can’t even play it on Steam.

I’m afraid that PayDay 3 is going to end up being a failure, because as usual, y'all will be working hard to make it so. I love this game, but it seems that all we have left is to imagine what it would have been with a competent direction."
sex
"Ever since U237, I can't join any lobbies, everything is ruined, lost all my side jobs, everything, I may as well had to have restarted entirely. Even if I do get into a lobby and play it somewhat, I always disconnect, then when I try to rejoin, I can't rejoin, then I have to reboot PAYDAY AND STEAM to wait 5 minutes for it to load again to get back in. Absolutely terrible. Horrific game now. I hope PD3 IS NOT LIKE THIS."
"u237's implementation of EOS just saved me $60AUD because I will not be buying Payday 3. If Starbreeze are this incompetent at implementing crossplay with EGS, it'll be completely fucked in PD3 as well, and I'm not dumb enough to support that."
Update 237 ruined it all :(
"Played this game for years, both on console and PC. Ended up buying every DLC because the game was fun, there's very few games that manage to include heists and have them be decent. 

But after using Steam matchmaking for 10 years with no issues, then they sell out to Epic, force everyone to download Epic's spyware, and what's worse is it doesn't even work properly, matches are laggy, if you can even get in one, essential features like being able to invite friends have been removed, if you try to use mods it blocks you from being able to play with others unless they have all the same mods when that was never an issue before..

Already removed your dodgy spyware from my PC as well as Payday 3 from my wishlist as I have no interest in it anymore. You sell out to shady companies, you get what you deserve."
"I played Payday the heist with all their reasonable DLC. I got hyped for Payday 2 and preordered it.

Boy, not many saw coming what they were about to do to PD2. Overpriced DLCs back in the day, DLC galore for EVERYTHING(Clothing, gun sights, muzzles, for every gun modification, guns, dlcs for masks, maps, skills and so on), broken promise and misusage of the Hypetrain event, Lootboxes for Weaponskins, later Weaponskins with bonus stats in the lootboxes.

Starbreeze monetized the shit out of this game and showed more and more, how less they truly care about the fanbase and just want the money.

Now, they reached the end of the road with PD2 and are already monetizing PD3 with Preorder bullshit.

Don't worry, just a burned fan, who regrets to have supported this."
don't work no more
"I have hundreds of hours clocked into this game, i genuinely love it and played it for a few years before taking a break due to life stuff and other games coming out. Payday 2 is a great game, a genuinely fun time with friends and the constant updates helps keep things fresh even if the new additions are small and the paid dlc quite rampant, though they're reasonably priced enough that they're generally worth it.

I'm not recommending this game now, because as of the time of this being put out Payday 2 has just been moved to the epic games store and it has completely broken the game.

There are loads of reviews already pointing out the flaws, matchmaking being broken, the game's modding tools being broken, some not being able to launch the game all because the game had to be updated and implemented into epic and its online service/

I am unsure of how the epic version runs, and i am not going bother getting that just to test it especially since all my dlc and progress has been on steam, so until these issues are fixed i cannot and will not recommend the steam version to anyone."
Monotonous
this game is dead now
they broke the game
Epic Gayms
DROPPED Linux support. People who bought this game cannot play anymore. I wouldn't buy anything from this publisher when they will just remove your ability to play the game.
"I loved this game. I loved playing this game with friends. After the server update my best bet is playing solo, which I don't like to do. The servers need to be reverted to steam ones instead of Epic's so its playable again, and then my review may change. Until then I'm just disappointed."
fuck update 237
bad game no rapp battles in there
Why is my left ball bigger than the right?
"UPDATE 237 

FUCKED ME IN THE ASS

THE GAME DOES NOT EVEN OPEN

AHHHHHHH"
"The recent Epic Online Services update added crossplay for Epic players at the expense of Steam players. The game won't even function without being connected to Epic. So if they're having server issues from some big Fortnite update, it's going to affect this game too. Where previously it didn't.

The devs have stayed silent regarding the PD2 community's discontentment regarding this recent change, so I'll be happy to give them this review. Don't buy any further Payday games/DLC, remove them from your wishlist and following list, and tell your friends to do the same. It's the only way they'll learn.

Edit: They recently posted a community announcement update with no mention of removing EOS in the game, so my review stands."
Murdered Linux support
Surprised it took them this long to break the game.
update 237 is definitely one of the updates of all time...
This was truly an EPIC update
"OVK/Starbreeze took the vbuck bribe and now we have to go through command line shenanigans just to play the mf game, 10/10 would acquire instantaneous buyer's remorse again"
U237 removed all interest for me to play the game. Way to go guys. You fucked it up. You fucked it up so badly just to make us buy a crappier sequel that's not even out yet.
Epic games turns everything it touches to ash
"Back in 2017 when i was still playing this game, OVERKILL said they were going to start working on PAYDAY3 and that there was not going to be anymore DLC for this game.

6 years and 42 DLCs later PAYDAY3 got its steam page up.

I would like to post a negative review on PAYDAY3 just for this, but I also don't want to spend the money on liars."
trollshrugged themselves
After the most recent update adding in Epic Games support i tried to play with a friend who was using the -steamMM launch command to get the game working since i was not having the issue but when suggesting for me to use the command so we could use steam invites to play together i launched the game using the command and the game promptly erased all my save data and progress. A useless update that has ruined a game i have supported for nearly a decade. Very upset 0/10.
You can stick your Epic Store bullshit where the sun dont shine.
fix the epic grimes and steam crossplay
they fucked the entire game with the newest update
"With EGS addition and update 237, matchmaking is ridiculously bugged still even with the hot fix they did. Game was working perfectly with seamless matchmaking and now its just broken, cant recommend at its current state."
"They were doing great,than killed it all for money"
Game no work me angry >:(
"Its like a second The Sims game. But just because of the amount of DLCs you can purchase. You'll pay more than 250€ to own JUST all DLCs.
I would get a refund if i payed for the game"
I'm glad that they killed payday 2 just in time to reveal that you can now buy payday 3. I guess it's not enough that you have a new game to sell but you also need to break the old one so that nobody wants to play it anymore.
"With the acclaim that it had received, I was expecting more from this game. Neat, probably WAY better with friends and not as relevant as Payday 3 is coming out soon."
How much did Epic pay you?
"> Went to re-install the game.
> Epic online services not connecting.
> Uninstalled."
Was a good game. Now its just a burning mess
"I heard Zoomerday 3 is coming out there, it's a pity there is no page in steam
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
"A fantastic game that i enjoyed for quite a while, but the update where they linked epic store they ruined it. forced multiplayer sessions to host on epic games store and now you literally cannot do multiplayer anymore."
"Came back after a year away and  you guys somehow screwed the game up so hard, me and a few others can't even launch the game after verifying anymore, and have to downgrade to a legacy version, thank you people for selling out.

New info
Alright, The not being able to launch the game was on me, but still, apparently you lot didn't do this game any good over the last couple weeks."
"This used to be one of my favourite games with a surprising amount of community driven events a couple ARG's and decent teamwork based gameplay. Key phrase ""used to be"". My opinion has soured, mostly the behind the scenes and monetary practices but recently they made multiplayer and modding more difficult with a massive oversight of a partnership with Epic Online Store.

The numerous DLC alone is enough to turn players away, even if you buy the complete edition bundle you are still missing several power creep DLC's they added after declaring no more paid DLC's. Even amongst those within the bundle there is a paid advertisement and tie-ins with other media not even related to any element of Payday. 

They added microtransaction weapon skin loot boxes akin to CS:GO a slight difference being that some weapon skins added stat boosts. This was one of the first major exodus's of the player base. Later during update 100 they removed the paying aspect and made them free to open from that point on, later still they removed the entire loot box system and replaced it with daily reward weapon skins. 

Recently they added the update 237 which is when they switched the Steam Matchmaking with Epic Online Store's, using the Epic servers for multiplayer and match making. This has lead to being unable to connect to multiplayer lobbies and removed being able to join lobbies via Steam. Due to this, they have shot multiplayer outside of Epic Online Store in the foot.

There is still a good game in there, it's just buried under mismanagement, greedy developers and power creep. I'd say get the game if you can play with friends but as previously mentioned, you can't do that any more. I hope Payday 3 will have sorted their Matchmaking, have sensible DLC that isn't driven by power creep and that the microtransactions within stay purely cosmetic. But as it stands now, Payday 2 is a beaten and broken beta that is not worth the money nor the disk space it rides on."
update 237 = bad
"В жизни не покупайте этот кусок кала.
Хотя можете купить саму игру за 19 рублей по скидке и скачать DLS Unlocker, чтобы не тр A хать себе мозг"
"Always enjoyed this game mostly for the content people created.

you killed them Starbrereze, even carrot."
EPIC SHIT STORE  FUCKING SOLD TO EPIG SHIT STUPID
I will pirate payday 3
Im a linux user and 237 broke everything for me. Basically an exit scam after all the money i spent on the dlc
Thumbs down just because they sold their souls to Epic. Dead game.
"game itself is good but no tutorials makes it hard for beginners to learn. also, game crashes on startup / when joining lobbies."
"I love the moment Overkill said ""It's payday!"" and sold themselves out to Epic Shit Games"
"Ive loved this game for a long while but, now that they have sold out to epic games, and changed the matchmaking, the game just completely does not work for me anymore. I have verified files and reinstalled but I cant even get to the start up cutscene without the game hard crashing"
Insulting amount of DLCs
EPIC
"Good game but always have connection problem, there are too much item that need DLC to unlock"
"meh, just really another shooter with ""interact here"" stuff scattered around. Friends wanted to play it with me, but the games age really shows, nothing really seems engaging with the exception of the stealth missions.

TLDR; generic at its worst, an actual heist game at its best"
(Update 237) Look how they massacred my boy
"i still can't believe that you made so many mistakes so fast, probably a new world record...also i stil don't have my haunted outfit, i waited already a year, please, at least give me that"
"This game is so much fun with other people, it's a nice game to turn your brain off on the lower difficulties and sweat extra hard on the higher ones. There's super fun hidden lore and a really complex secret endgame.

Shame the latest update sided with the one gaming store known for actively installing spyware and stealing games from other markets with a definitely not at all suspicious endless supply of cash.
RIP Payday 3, excited to see how long it takes before the Steam page magically disappears and it becomes an Epic exclusive.

Real shame."
"thanks for not being able to buy your game for the third time
---------------------------
спасибо за невозможность купить вашу игру в третий раз"
"I guess the game just isn't for me.  It was highly recommended by several friends, but I just find the gameplay boring and repetitive."
-steamMM
they removed Linux support for literally no reason
"I'm Leaving it. 

 You killed it."
UPDATE 237 killed the game
"haven't played in months came back due to the PD3 trailer and things are just broken. DSOD lobbies don't exist lobbies in general are way down and the majority i've seen either crash or just cant be connected to properly. 

second if i wanted to be apart of the EG ecosystem i would be i don't fully understand the reasoning behind forcing it on people now when the presumed final update is less then a month away. aswell as dropping support for linux when they've been brought along for so many years just to be denied the end for assumably a hefty payout of yuan. i'm unsure of whether you can even play it on the steam deck as i haven't tried nor will.

I feel as though breaking the game and goodwill of the Community has payed off in the short term i do not believe the new EG players will stick around. so come September the game may very well not have the players to play online"
poo poo
I can't recommend a game that forces you to use EOS
"only praised because it has no competition
bad game
live service would a compliment, looking forward to how the next cash grab will be"
Update 237 is not very EPIC if you ask me
update 237.
"1,467 hours spent on this game, with good memories. wasted on one EFFING update. thanks, starbreeze. for screwing it up, what a way to destroy your fanbase. screw your epic games server shiz, who uses epic games anyway other than just for free games. they're desperate."
"Thanks for crippling the game on Steam, guys. Very cool."
Can't believe they killed the game before Payday 3 came out.
Crazy how you can destroy an entire game in just one update
"starbreeze, blinded by greed lol"
"You already know why. This game has been on a steady power-crept decline for years now, and U237 has put the final nail in the coffin."
"they made the game literally unplayable in the last couple months before the new one came out

lol"
"good concept, poor execution"
"Can no longer play because dont accept the privacy policy.

If you want to have my data to sell it on, you gotta give me more than access to the game i already paid for.

Scumbags."
"Ever since the recent update to EGS cross-play, this game has truly become a dead game. Hosting or joining lobbies are glitched out to the max where it becomes completely unplayable. I recommend halting purchases on any dlc or even Payday 3 until the developers get their shit together!"
"Imagine getting this game for free, only to spend a ton of money on DLC. This game is only alive thanks to it's modding community. Rest in Piss Payday 2."
"TL;DR - The golden era is gone.

Very displeased with the whole "" We will never have microtransactions "" to having more in total when what the base game is worth. Poor support as well, considering they bricked the game in an effort to get more players from another platform. All of this while developing a third entry."
they heisted my real life money
"Cant play, goes to black screen after startup :("
Yeah they REALLY fucked the game
"Still a fun game, but they killed a lot of community with this sellout to Epic, but mostly how it was implemented. You used to be able to see 30 or 40k players, and have tons of people going around in matches, now if I go to search games, I barely see any, and many people are seeing tons of issues with joining and just overall playing the game. At this point it's not a recommend from me, fun, but not really worth it atm."
"[quote]
After more than 10 years, PAYDAY 2 will finally spread its wings and soar to a new PC platform. Starting today, you can now perform the unique heisting experience found only in PAYDAY via Epic Games Store. To celebrate this PAYDAY 2 will be free to claim on Epic Games Store from June 8th running until June 15th. Alongside the free period, the majority of DLCs will be for sale via the Epic Games Store.

We’ve worked hard to make the finest heisting experience on the market available on a new platform without any fuss. For existing players, there won’t be any third party software or functionality downloaded. So if you play on Steam, you’ll be able to keep playing as if nothing happened, though you might notice an influx of new players.[/quote]

They must have used weird auto-correct because Steam version is buggy as hell and also dropped Linux support."
"Rest in Piss.

-GM"
update 237
this game is 83 gigabytes but it relies on dlc. i got this one sale for like 90 cents and that's absolutely what the base game is worth
Update 237
Dead Game speedrun any%
"All you had to do was: NOTHING, just let the game be as the game stops receiving updates BUT NOOOOOOOOOOOO, you had to go and ruin the game in a single update, because Crimefest 2015 wasn't enough.

It was fun while it lasted. GGs."
"U237 made the game even ""more dead"" than it was before. 
May you rest in peace good old payday 2, like my memories for you will. </3"
