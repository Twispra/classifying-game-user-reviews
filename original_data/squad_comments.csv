"- Finally got into the game after downloading sus 3rd party mods
- Walked and shot a bit
- Got kicked for ""beaing AFK"""
honestly this game just doesnt hold up in 2025. basically what i'd expect out of something that started as a kickstarter crowdfund for people who played a battlefield 2 mod.
"Very bad game, so high lagging that it is unplayable. People write about that on lot of forums, I didnt now that until I started to play this crap. Comuniti is vey bad, it is not good as you can find on some forums. The game is 5/100 for real!!!"
This game has a lot of negative features and consumer practices. Imagine selling emotes in a milsim lmao. The only reason I play and enjoy it is for the star wars mod. Go play Project Reality for free and more content than squad.
"Honestly upon first impression the game is fucking terrible, I've tried 3 different seemingly normal servers and all i got was disappointment. the game is truly not fun for people who aren't fat no lifers who couldn't get into the real armed services."
"Very Bad Optimization, great game but when scoped in the FPS drops very badly, shame on the devs"
"I could see this game being really fun, but only if you have a group of friends who you play it with and are willing to put up with the learning curve. It is a milsim so not sure what I really expected. If you like milsims that are pretty hardcore this is your game."
"Shit game kept running for hours to go to instantly die, no communication, it's too complex not for someone who has a job and wants to play for few hours"
this game is shit arma knock off
"Bad game, bad community. Game modes have 0 explanation. All the nations armor are 90% the same. Don't buy it"
"A boring game, and its community is extremely toxic!"
"this game has a poor optimization, no matter how much u set the lowest u can in this game, is barely playable"
walking simulator with guns
"nothing works like its meant to work, and there are no players in the servers. and also no way to host one with my friends. very sad ＞﹏＜

4.5/10"
Can't skip the 10 minute intro.
"ts is so ahh, ppl kick you for being new. the sweaty greasy discord mods scream at you when you do so much as misclick fire during a so called ""pep talk"""
A couple of updates back i started having stutters that haven't dissaperead even thought i just upgraded from a 1080ti to a 4090 and still the stutters are still there more fps but stutters now and then
"what the fuck did i just play ?!! terrible x3 optimization, it made my machine shut down 4 times during this little time of gameplay, which was absolutely fucking garbage,also the devs seem not to have touched nor seen a gun in their entire life the recoil is insane. And one thing for those nerdy admins or whoeever runs those servers, i don't need to be erwin rommel to play in your mighty server you dum fucks it's obvious that i'm new to this game, and some servers marked as NEW PLAYER FRIENDLY and yet the second you join i hear GTFO and get kicked out of the match ( happened 3 times in a row ). don't bother buy this shit even if you got for free it's a waste of bandwidth to download, seems already too late for new players to try this fucking garbage."
"TLDR: The gameplay and tactical aspects are great, but, overall, this game leaves an impression like it's still in very early access.

(Most of the time) feels (almost) incredible once you play it for a few dozen hours and get used to some of its quirks. However, in the beginning, this game felt really off-putting because of the lack of polish. Infantry combat is pretty solid, but vehicles and helicopters work like garbage. This is especially noticeable after playing games like War Thunder. Light tracked vehicles feel really jerky while turning. Large trucks will straight up fly like they are made out of carboard if you crash into something. Piloting a heli feels like piloting an alien spaceship. Its pitch/roll speed depends only on your mouse sensitivity and nothing else, or at least it seems so.

Some areas of the game are polished, but most aren't. Firearms have incredible textures, models and animations. And it feels nice to shoot them. But helicopters look like shit once you get closer and see the details or, god forbid, their interiors. UI looks and feels really outdated. Maps don't have any fine details or destructible objects, so a f.....ing wooden fence is enough to stop a tank.

Right, this game also has really poor optimization, at least as of now. Devs are currently switching to UE5, though, which can do wonders when it's in the right hands.

Some aspects of the game which absolutely should be improved, IMO:
- Add some actually good vehicle physics, models, textures, sounds and interiors.
- Improve map detalisation, make some objects (Like wooden fences) destructible.
- When you are incapacitated, your camera just shakes like crazy. It could definitely use some stabilization. Or, maybe, add some actually decent ragdoll physics so that bodies don't jump around and clip through objects all the time.
- Make it so that you can actually do something useful while sitting inside a vehicle, like reloading your weapons, healing your teammates or applying bandages. Just sitting on your ass is, at least, kinda boring.
- Make it so that casualties stay inside the vehicle instead of instantly falling out. Not sure how good of an idea this is, though.
- Using F1-F10 keys for switching the spot where you sit on a vehicle is.... Well, pretty strange.... Would be nice to have some sort of window open up instead. You could display all available and taken spots on it and just click on one of them with your mouse to change.
- Maybe it's time to stop adding more factions/maps, this game already has enough of both. Plus, everyone's picking the same few ones anyway. Simply adding more doesn't make the game better if some of its base mechanics are still very raw.

Overall, this game can bring a lot of fun, especially if you play with your friends in one squad or as different squad leaders in a single match. However, the quality of the game is really uneven. To a person like me, who doesn't know much about gamedev, it seems like Squad doesn't have a reason to cost so much or to take up so much space on my computer. At least in its current state."
"i dont like to be kicked from squad from squal lead with no explanation ,also you make the game very dificult to aim  becouse the low stamina"
Lots of crashes and bugs lately
"Incredibly wooden game! 
Runs ok. 
Still haven't discovered the technology of giving the player an option to just removing awful scopes from your gun so I can see while aiming. 
Semi-realistic.
Not my thing!"
not open play
wasted 20 minutes of my damn life having to sit through an unskippable cutscene. this is horse shit.
game with shitty servers problems
completed the tutorial went to find a game searched for a server for around 2 hours got instantly kicked once i got in so in conclusion great game
"99% of the time your running and getting killed, other 1% of the time your shooting at people and maybe getting 1-5 kills. better off buying hell let loose if u want better firefights and overall gameplay."
"people on the game are assholes and when you finally see an enemy and steady your gun witch takes like 30 seconds your dead, uniforms all look the same, and its complicated to be ""realistic"" then why tf don't they add a realistic sniper section so i don't get kicked every time i choose marksman, spotter and fucking shooter"
Company shot this game into the ground.
the comunity is a bunch of try hard cry babies
"just go into downtown bronx with a sandwich sign that reads ""i hate n_____s"" , like in Die Hard
and you'll know what it feels like to play this game."
"В этой игре ты не солдат, а маленькая палестинская девочка. полный бред. чуть чуть пробежал - прицел дрожит, будто ты пил водку целую неделю."
not worth 50 fucking dollars
"servers have been overrun by a bunch of new age faggots. Been banned from about every server now for the stupidest shit, things like ""offensive language"" or God forbid you tell a squad leader to actually do their job and organize/lead the fucking squad. Like isn't this a mature rated war simulator game??? Where did all these jrotc kids come from? This was not a problem when the game first came out"
"FPS drops all the time.

The aiming-in feature they added is not realistic. You don't take 3 weeks to adjust to the scope. They're making the game so realistic that it isn't even realistic anymore. Not to mention the fact you get out of breath in 5 steps. Is this a military person or a McDonald's employee handed a gun?"
"why are you forcing me to watch into movie every time, without ability to skip it. FFS"
"russians/ukrainians/slavic ""people"" ruin the game"
absolute dog water
Don't waste your money on this crap
this game is so hard your eyes will bleed
used to love this game but  latley server admins been on a power trip
"Super buggy can't know if graphic glitch or been shoot at, if you like playing buggy games with a lot of bot and almost no player this game is for you. you better put your cash in the hawk tua coin. 3 HOURS OF MY LIFE LOST. The person who recommend me this shit hate me for sure"
massive fps drops
My friend got this game for me and I just can not seem to find joy in it. There are so many toxic players that flame you and then go straight to admins of servers to complain. I am just trying to learn the game bro.
the game that could have been good that simply just isnt clunky as fk movement dog shit sighting for scopes and horrid controls
Infantry Combat Overhaul (ICO) ruined this game it was so fun RIP I played from 2017 till 2023 6.0 update
buggiest milsim
"Yeah its probably the most gate keeping community out of all the mil-sim games out there. It can be fun, but play it with friends. Alone its a toxic hell hole. I'd also recommend playing the Galactic Contention and Global Escalation mods. Global Escalation is squad, but you have to fight your own body less. And also i dont know how the devs messed up magnified sights so much but its solved on there. Moderation is a mess, nobody adheres to the rules and if you wanna get into flying, be ready to be fighting over helicopters every round. I wouldn't recommend for new-comers to the genre of mil-sim, dont play vanilla its ass and if you wanna have some form of fun play with buddies. Thats all i have to say."
running simulator
"I started playing this game years ago !! Loved every second of it, early access and long after it was exciting, the nuance of the project reality days. mad a few friends and had a few laughs and some intense moments for sure. Stopped playing about 3 years ago and decided to come back and give it another try.

OMG what a mistake!! Should of stayed away with those happy memories and sense of nostalgia. However my dumb self had to give it a shot again.

Explain to me how in so many years with so many updates this game is still optimized like a potato (Forgive me Potatoes) the game play feels (Yes its my opinion don't like it boo hoo) feels like its become more arcade instead of Mil Sim. 

Balancing !!!! what is that? Can I eat it?

DOnt let the screenshots and videos fool you!! You might . . . Might once in a blue moon see that much action. Most of the time you are walking, in a logi truck, in the re spawn menu or digging sandbags . . then 5 min of getting shot at by Casper the F#@K you ghost, cause you got no idea where that shot came from and oh. . . your team will be helpful 40 to 60% of the time. Oh there is a medic near by to help you and revive you HAHA Nope that man took that class because of the extra bandages and self heal !!

This is one of those games where you hate it, but you hate it so much you love it . . then lose your S#@T with a team member after he shot you for the 9th time because he cant tell a USMC Helmet from a freaking Scarf. So you rage quit go for a walk touch grass and come straight back saying . . this time. . this time will be different. . . Yeah its not. It never will be."
shit ahh game
they went over board with every think on this game. aiming reload times. recoil is so bad that it feels like you not even playing a actual shooting game . its slow. sometimes people even wont move the whole game as there to afriad to try and handle the recoil of there gun. in my eyes the worst hardcore FPS made to date !
Negative until getting stuck on everything with a vehicle is not a thing anymore.
Ebanoe optimization!
garbage
semi auto simulator you will never use automatic ever on any gun cause you will miss everything
"very insecure and homosexual player base, game would be fun if man children weren't larping instead of having fun and going outside to talk to women"
"Gunplay seems to have gone downhill in recent years, the audio and explosions ect are so immersive, but christ is the low stamina and crap gunplay a put off, feels so slow and awkward it really holds the game back."
"squad... pfft, should call it Wad because the game runs like a piece of shit"
"RTX 3070 R5800, this game is unplayable... lag and getting 30-45 fps only  devs are piece of sht i wish i can refund it.. stupid don't buy please"
bad game
"""please equip squad leader kit"""
unreal engine 4 on this game is the biggest pile of dogshit ever!
game runs like crap
I aint buying any more online games. Paying through my fking nose
Decent game but community ban list is beyond stupid a lot of admins for servers will just ban over a power trip perm bans suddenly bans you from multiple servers game is decent if you have patience to deal with speds role playing or just people running and dying instantly  almost 1000 hours its just a waste of time overall no progression or level or weapons modifications
"DO NOT PLAY 1STRB SERVERS!  I WAS KICKED FROM THEIR SERVERS FOR ONE-MANNING A VIC AFTER MY SQUADMATE LEFT AND SOMEONE COMPLAINED AND NOW I AM PERMANENTLY BANNED.  I ARGUED WITH THE 1STRB ADMING ""col"" giggidy"" AND HE PERMA BANNED ME AND KICKED ME FROM THE 1STRB DISCORD SERVER.  THE GAME IS GREAT, BUT OVER -ZEALOUS LOCALIZED SERVER ""admins"" WILL RUIN IT.  HE PUT ME ON SOME ""COMMUNITY BAN"" LIST SO THAT WILL LIKELY AFFECT MY ABILITY TO PLAY THIS GAME.  AGAIN.  I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TOXIC, THAT I AM AWARE OF AND THAT 1STRB, ""col giggidy"" COULD SHOW????  PLEASE HELP."
"Has a worse logistics and infantry system than competitors such as Arma Reforger. If you play dedicated logistics, you deprive the team of one of very few vehicles necessary to play logistics. If you play infantry, the gameplay feels unintuitive and more difficult in comparison to other milsim titles. If you play helicopters, you will actively fight to get the helicopter to do what you want it to do and god forbid you touch the ground a teensy bit too hard, you will combust into flames and kill everyone onboard.

No vehicle respawning, fixed loadouts, and gameplay difficulty through unintuitive design makes a game that is not worth the play."
Server list not showing up. For weeks my end. what the FUCK are the devs doing to this game.
"I loved this game until they did the rework of the shooting. Before if I got into a good position I had the opportunity to get multiple kills. I could shoot and scoot and outplay enemies or set up at a good vantage point and do work. After the update its so hard to even get one kill. The recoil and shaking in the scope make it impossible to have a decent fire rate on target. When an enemy shoots at you now it makes it impossible for you to see anything. I get that they were going for realism but come on man. Its not even fun anymore. Its a shooter that you can barely even shoot anyone in. 

The shooting rework in this game is the reason why ARMA Reforger is getting so popular. Id much rather play Squad than ARMA but Squad is no fun anymore."
Terrible performance for a 2015 game. Do not buy until the issue is fixed.
trash
moving to mid engine 5
the admins and server rules are getting worse every day that passes
Love the game but it needs achievements! Ill give a thumbs up if you give me a reason to grind the achievements!
Unoptimized b*lshit. Don't buy until >dec.2025
"High end pc gettin 50 - 45 FPS. Forums says, that its poorly optimised. Can't really play.."
regarded crap game got banned for cheating when I never cheated
No armor specific squad unlike squad 44 which is a terrible idea.
"I really, REALLY, like this game, but I have never had so many technical issues just trying to launch a game like I have had with this. It feels like if you put it down for 3-4 months, there is a new technical issue you have to overcome."
"Runs like utter crap, clunky and sluggish controls and animations, looks bad. 3/10"
гімно
Хуйня ебаная
"the mechanics are aweful, graphics are mediocre at best. Servers are usually ran my neck bearded redditors, all around 2/10 game. i would NOT recommend."
Game is built for something the playerbase is not capable of doing matches are unorganized half the time its a running simulator think of it as dayz but war and more polished nothing more If i could refund it i would
lol
e0g 0e
Could be great but the devs seem to want you an inch from your monitor looking through iron sights while scopes feel extremely clunky. solo play doesnt exist anymore
Honestly some of the most fun you'll ever have in a milsim but oh my god the random network issues are an absolute nightmare. As much time as you spend playing you'll spend trying to get the damn thing to run.
Long time to find a match.
I SWEAR TO FUCKING GOD THIS PIECE OF SHIT GAME DOESNT WANT TO DETECT MY AUDIO DEVICE FOR SOME REASON IVE DONE EVERYTHING I KNOW THAT WOULD FIX IT AND IT JUST DOESNT WORK. i havent been able to play this game in months. im getting to the point where i want my fuckin money back

Keeps crashing...
"The game suffers from a segment of the playerbase that is irritatingly vulgar and childish, which hurts the gameplay experience.

Some of the community is patient and respectful, but there lies an issue of encountering disrespectful and offensive players which reduces my will to work together and play the objective.

The game mechanically is good in terms of the controls and combat, but it takes too long imo to get back into the action. A large portion of the match time is spent walking or driving to a point. The game could improve if there was stronger moderation and if there was a gamemode that replicated the faster pace of games like RS2 while still maintaining a realistic  experience"
you sit in queue for 30 minutes just to get disconnected from it
"No servers hosted by the game itself, relies too much on the community, and the vehicle handling is absolutely horrendous."

this game used to be really fun in 2016. now it just sucks unbelievably bad in every way imaginable.
"Great game, unfortunately if you're an Aussie gamer there is a lack of servers.

BIGD CAN SUCK A BIGD, MOST PANSY ADMINS I'VE EVER COME COME ACROSS. BANNED BY ASSOCIATION NO WARNING.

ADMINS WONT EVEN LOOK AT THE TICKET. WHAT A JOKE.

F**K U BIGD. BIGD ADMINS DONT EVEN KNOW HOW TO ADMIN. BUNCH OF CHILD FIDDLERS."
Spent 87.9% of the time walking.
"most servers are always either full or empty :( i wanna rate it good, but ive had this game for a year and still havent been able to find a server"
I do not recommend the game because of the verbal aggressiveness of the players which is permeated by nationalistic bellyaching and threats in real life.
10 YEARS AND YOU STILL CAN'T JOIN THE SAME FACTION WITH YOUR GROUP - that's not even the worst part but this game doesn't deserve more time or words.
Say anything an admin doesnt like they will kick you for whatever reason dont listen to some retard you also got a kick or temp ban
just all around not great. Large learning curve. Spend most of the time spawning in at the main base to have to spend the next 15 minutes running across the map. its really not great.
"The best way I can describe this game is that it feels like it was made in 2010. The core of the game has potential but the UI, gunplay, movement, visuals, and style in general feel outdated. This game has a core following, but to get a good experience, you have to download server specific mods which barely change gameplay aside from uniforms for the most part in my experience. I get what this game is going for, but I cannot recommend it."
"I don't understand how such an old game is so poorly optimized - I reinstalled Squad after not playing for years, and all I've been met with are crashes. I can't load into a server and play the game without it crashing. On my last attempt, the game crashed my PC. So I'm uninstalling."
"You are a sniper, 300m behind enemy lines. The team leader leaves the squad, and you are now the new team leader with a brand-new rifle setup and only one magazine. You have 5 minutes to configure your team leader setup before being kicked from the server, but you are 1.5km away from your nearest point.

Edit: Downloaded the game again after a long time, logged in, got hit, couldn't run because I was crouched, uninstalled again. Worst game-simulator ever. If you’re thinking about buying this, consider Arma Reforger instead."
"You buy squad because you think it'll be fun, you think it'll be bada*s, and all of these things are true. Right up until you interact with the player base, my god some of yall suck so much. No developer servers so it's all ran my the equivalent of the video game worlds discord mod blight and cancer. If you want to get team killed and kicked from servers after waiting for 10 minutes just to join, then drive your squad 10 more minutes just to get kicked once the action starts?? Nah bro f*ck this game."
im not racist
"its a really fun game but the gun play is terrible, its hard to get the muzzle near someone thats just 10 feet away because of the gun swaying where you look"
Predatory ban system made by people who treat this like a congressional meeting. No public REAL casual servers
makes me sad :(
"The players in this game squadbaiting and kicking from squads because they want to play with their shitty 2 man teams ruin the entire experience. Creates a walking simulator that ends up resetting you every 15 minutes because the squad leads either dont FUCKING SPEAK ENGLISH ON AN ENGLISH SERVER, or just outright dont understand the principal of having a squad. 4/10. community ruins the experience. waste of my time."
"Dogshit ass game. Walked 1.5km to setup my 240 on flank hill, out of the sudden got my entire kit snatched out of my hands by noone out of nowhere and replaced with m4 with a single 30rd mag, all bc idiot SL kicked me out bc his buddy wanted to play MG gunner. Listen up, Offworld. How about you make our fucking game NOT DOGSHIT????? WHEN IS IT GOING TO HAPPEN, ANOTHER 5 YEARS, 10 YEARS, WHEN?????"
The community is the single worst i have EVER met in my entire 36 year history of gaming. The absolute bottom of the barrel when it comes to just about every aspect of humanity. Want to learn Squad leading? You'll get yelled at for not Magically knowing how. Want to have conversation with someone like a normal adult? Nope someone will jump in and IMMEDIATLY start being a COMPLETE prick. I've even left to comments on on this post so you'll be able to see with your own eyes the kinds of people who play this dumpster fire of a video game. I wont even get started on the amount of Terriorist sypmathisers that pop up. Stay the hell away from this game when there are so many better options. Its to late for me I already made the mistake of wasting 35 hours on this shit.
"It was fun, not anymore.
Half the time waiting to get into a server, then another quarter to deploy because community is completly avoiding communicating so you are trapped at the base with no heffing SQUADs open, as if it wasn't the name of the game to play in SQUADS, and not just two or three in one and then lock it up. 
Oh, and did I mentioned the fact that you get a third of your time playing the game waiting for a medic to revive you instead of just giving up because you still hope for someone to understand that when you die you lose tickets and lose the game ?
Oh and by the way, I add that here. This is not a game. This is for a lot of players their life and blood. So expect a lot of yelling when you lose, expect to be kicked without warning,  expect Squad Leaders being agressive."

"perm ban for no reason, discord mod had a toddler tantrum

I was playing in a server when I came across a group of enemy soldiers, they had no clue where I was. I shot at as many as I could (about 5) Then died. Around a minute later I had re-spawned and was walking through a field when I got kicked from the server for ""hacking"". At the time I could still play other servers.

About a week later, I logged onto steam and got an alert saying I had permanently been banned from the game. It said that a moderator or dev from the server I had been playing, had contacted the devs of squad itself and they perm banned me. My highest kill game on any server didn't even reach double digits.

I'm trying to appeal the ban but so far squad support haven't even responded."

世外你做nm游戏呢，你老婆被曹烂了，所以没心思做好游戏吗？
fun and boring... sigh
This game blows harder than my ex wife.
"Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty good game in terms of the gameplay loop; however, there is little motivation to continue playing over time. There's no form of progression to motivate further play and effort. Unless you just get off to this kind of thing, I wouldn't recommend spending anything on it because there's a high chance of seeing all the game has to offer immediately. You play for one day, and you've more or less seen the whole game unless you dive into the deep end and get into private sessions and all that. Even then though, the motivation is winning for the sake of winning; there is nothing to gain from trying or continuing to play. I would make suggestions to the developers as to how this could be tackled to further the lifespan of the game, but the game is perhaps a bit too old for such radical things."
"Last played it a few years ago and it was really fun. Just tried today with some friends, and the game forces you to watch the ~3 minute trailer from the store page before dumping me into an infinite black loading screen. Relaunching doesn't help. Verifying game integrity does nothing. I'm on the latest video drivers. I outright can't play this game anymore."
"I try to get my money back after 2 hours but steam did not give me my money back,  I think the game is more complicated than in needs to be, controls feel sooooo slow, like changing guns or going prone or using scope, why doesn't scope fill the screen?  Why do I die from a 10 foot fall?  really wish I got my money back."
"Movement in this game feels like your soldier weights as much as an elephant, stamina is enough to sprint for a short distance, scope stability is going to the moon and back, ppl constantly kicking you out of the squads especialy if they are vehicle squads that just fight over them always. tried rly hard to have fun but i just get frustrated every single time."
"Bought Squad when it was still in early access forever ago, And during that time I would have definitely recommended it to anyone looking for something a little more challenging and within the milsim realm of games alongside HLL, Arma, and many others. 

Though in the past year or so with the severe decline of this game I wouldn't even recommend downloading it on a free to play weekend. From weapon balancing decisions to the addition of useless micro transactions for cosmetics and emotes that 0% of the community asked for.

My biggest complaint with this game is the game itself, It prides itself on being a Milsim I.E Military Simulator that said why is it the soldier/ character you play as have a asthma attack after running for 20 seconds or better yet the character can't seem to shoulder a 6.5 Lbs M4 for more then 10 seconds to aim down sights... Not to mention god forbid you're in the prone with a 240 and have it setup with a bipod and squeeze out a 6-8 round burst because after that your aiming at the International Space Station. 

If you want to play a good Milsim that's also cross play Hell Let Loose.
If you want a Milsim that Is cross play that has 10x better Mod Support and 20x better game play Arma Reforger."
fuck the community banlist
Premium price for a sub par game with early 2010's graphic quality.
"stamina is ridiculously short so when engaging the enemy its like being a storm trooper!, all outdated kit, reloads and raises weapon into shoulder in 3-5 working days (its not like there's a war going on!)."
way to many cheaters with aim lock the deathcam is always hilarious to watch
stupid
"I came from playing arma reforger to this. What a mistake that was. The graphics are mediocre at best, the movement feels stiff and janky. The recoil is horrendous too. Overall it's a really bad game. Do yourself a favour and avoid this rushed mess of a game. Go buy arma reforger instead. You won't regret it."
Played Reforger for a week then came back to this and it felt like playing absolute trash. The graphics difference alone is just mind blowing. OWI has ALOTTTT of catching up to do.
"I've really tried to give it a 1h30 chance, waste of time on these most Toxic community i have ever seen."
I CANT PLAY NOTHING KICK ME FROM EVRYSERVER
Don’t get me wrong I love the core idea of the game and a lot of the mods are absolute bangers but the gameplay with all the weapon systems and vehicle mechanics are just way to floaty and janky. Essentially the recoil on the weapons in this are by far have the most punishing recoil in any game I’ve played ever played.
a piece of shit
Literally only one reason not to buy this game and that is because the devs are so stupid that they put a max volume 5 minute unskippable video at the beginning of launch talking about how the game works. Like nobody plays games now days if they don't understand the game.
stuck on a trailer and a fucking black screen for 10 days in a row this game cant even load i played it literally last week with no issues and the next week its just constantly black and playing this shitty trailer atleast over 100 times.
Remove this intro video its loud and you cant skip it
"Walking simulator. Its quite buggy, the game play is deathly slow. From what I can see there is no weapon customization. Funny community but I do not get the hype or the rating behind this game at all. 99% of the time you are walking from point a to b and when you do get into a fire fight it's over in too short of an amount of time to actually enjoy it. I regret buying this game."
ICO SUCKS more balls than a thai street walker
"I was a fan of Squad since the alpha version (2017), but now I do not recommend wasting time on this game. The developers completely changed the game design in 2023, so most reviews are no longer relevant.
	•	The game is priced like a AAA title, yet its graphics and physics are stuck in the mid-2010s. Heavy vehicles are jumping while driving offroad.
•	There is NO DESTRUCTION AT ALL, EVEN LITTLE WOODEN FENCES ARE STATIC. It gets ridiculous when you’re driving a tank and get stopped by a tiny bush or a low wooden fence. At the same time, collisions don’t damage vehicles at all. Not to mention that mortars and tanks can fire at a small clay house (on Middle Eastern maps) for 10 minutes straight, and the house remains completely intact while the squad inside takes no damage.
	•	The shooting mechanics are unrealistic and clunky since 2023. The shooting in the trailer here in product page is fake, but devs keep it for years now. Now the weapon always shakes and when someone shoots at you, the screen goes dark. hitting the enemy has become more difficult and less realistic (I am an ex-soldier). The developers attempted to add “realism” by making the crosshair sway uncontrollably when a soldier is exhausted, yet in 10 years (since the alpha release in 2015), they never implemented a proper weapon resting mechanic. Only bipod-equipped weapons have any form of stabilization.
	•	No looting at all. AMMO IS LIMITED ­­– NO FUN SHOOTINGS, and you can only resupply at the main base or a FOB – if some selfless player sacrifices their fun to drive a logistics truck for you. When you respawn, you get the same amount of ammo you had at the time of death. You can’t even pick up extra ammo from fallen teammates who had the same weapon as you. There is no trophy system for enemy weapons either.
	•	Despite its pseudo-realism, you can’t hear enemy voice comms even if they’re speaking loudly right next to you – whether in local chat or over the radio. You also can’t capture enemy radios.
	•	The addition of modern factions has led to visual confusion. Many teams now have nearly identical camo patterns, making it difficult to distinguish friend from foe at a distance. You can even have NATO vs. NATO matches, where both sides look the same and sound the same because they use the same weapons.

Luckily, it’s 2025, and Squad now has competitors with better game design and graphics for the same price. I don’t consider Squad to be a true AAA title, despite the way it mimics one. It’s neither a casual shooter where you can just have fun, nor a hardcore mil-sim. There are no vanilla casual servers, where you have enough ammo to not think how to save bullets (remember, looting isn't available, no ammo resupply on respawn), the screen doesn't go dark when someone shoots to your side and weapons don't shake TOO MUCH."
밀스퍼거 병신 장앨녀들 존나 많노
ICO update ruined the game. Unplayable. No need to say more.
"Great Game
full of bugs and janky settings plz fix"
"Not recommended.
The wait time ""queue"" is way to long. Even going to an empty server the queue time is to long. We buy games in order to play, not to look at a screen with fancy distractions.
Game is not worth $50.00. Not even $5.00 for a game that does not do what it says it  does."
Absolute garbage. STAY AWAY from this pile of monkey crap
"-novid doesnt work, shit game

11.02.25 -novid still does not work and the most retarded trailer has been added to the intro
you guys dont ""... bridge the gap..."" between anyting. 1 out of 10 games got teamplay, the rest is just very nice arabs that dont know basic game mechanics after 911 hours playing"
walking simulator
"The price tag made me expect good graphics and good UI.
Though the gameplay is probably not bad, I can't really play it atm because the graphics are too distracting.

Might edit this review later"
"You can shoot guns like a 12 year old boy and sway your noodle arms crazy.
Also the game runs really bad with a lot of performance issues.

Otherwise, it's a great game."
shit nigga game my squad drove on a car without me and when i gestured them they just sprayed me with gatling on their car and i died
"very bad with fps, i have way stronger specs than requirements and its constantly at 30 to 40 fps, i feel robbed.

several updates later and my 3090 and i9 desktop still drops below 50 fps ..... :x"
"This game used to be really fun. Probs my most favorite PvP shooter of all time. Ever since the ICO it is absolutely abysmal. Getting random weapon sway because you are being suppressed or not have enough stamina is the worse imaginable effect I have seen in any game ever. There are other ways to slow the game down or make suppression usefull and this is not it. I like being able to aim my gun where I want to and not have it move randomly on its own. It literally feels like someone is moving a second mouse on your PC randomly and you are trying to fight them. Also lets talk about PiP scopes. First and foremost going from 80 fps to 40 for simply ADS. A problem we never had before that exists now for no reason. Or maybe realism that no one cares. At least not in the cost of frames. On top of the fact that the scopes cover most of your screen. I can sit here and say real life this life that all day but at the end of the day the game feels horrible to play because of the gun play/firefights alone and I don't care what the arguement is.  There is games that feel good to play and shoot in them like RoN, Arma 3, Ground Branch, even old Squad and then there is squad today which just feels horrible to play."
Game is random crashing even tho i have god pc
Game starts in the incorrect aspect ratio and I am unable to navigate to the setting menu to change it
Wanted to be in a Squad
"gone to shit especially in oceana, don't touch this game with a 10 foot pole"
Makers of this game have never driven a vehicle especially a quadbike in their lives.
"Good game, toxic community usually."
shit game!
"This game looks fun, until you get rolled by sweating tryhards, or solo rats who play this game like they are john mclaine."
die simulator
unskippable intro makes me want to just delete the game off my account this is the most annoying crap ive had to deal with for opening 1 stupid game i couldnt care less about what the intro video tells me
slop
In a game that requires your mic you'd assume you could use a mic just like any other game. My mic worked for years on this game and then it stopped randomly. Online it said i had to download a virtual audio cable to get it to work which his already stupid since its a mic that works on literally every other game. The virtual cable worked for about two days and now nothing I do makes the game recognize my headset. Hell let loose recognizes it tho.
"I truly love this game but I really think it needs to improve , the only reason i put this review as ""not recommended"" is for my complains to be seen thus I DO RECOMMEND this game i think you should try it out. my complains are pretty much the lack of gore elements and bloodshed, absence of certain animations, and physics. and it bothers me, really.
this game is a REALISTIC shooter game, and it stands on that ground pretty well, but who wouldnt love to see bloody hands, uniforms, bloodshed here and there, or even dirty muddy guns and uniforms? 
who wouldnt love seeing when a anti tank mine blows up, the tank be lifted upwards by the force, get visible damage on the sides? permanent hole on the ground maybe?
and certain animations we could benefit from, i can mention grabbing a fallen soldier body to safety, entering/dismounting a vehicle animation, mortar reloading animation
these things i believe would most definitely improve my experience, for sure there are more things we can have, i checked ""Allow comments"" box if you guys have more interesting ideas relating to this topic i would love to read it.
but here is something that MOST DEFINITELY needs to be added, a second voice option for ""Call Medic"" where the character doesnt yell and is more quiet call, would be great!, digging trenches is also good to have, imagine a whole squad shoveling to dig a trench lol
I hope the best for this game."
"These bitches wants a steam award, guys your game's gameplay and game character physics sucks. ARMA 3 is way better uninstalling this shit game"
Honestly idk why the reviews are so good for this game. It is incredibly clunky compared to others in the same genre.
ICO made the whole game unplayable.
Running simulator
The downloading and updating times and problems are new and make the game completely not worth it as someone with a solid amount of time in game the gameplay is awesome but that only matters if you can get in game.
"This game that requires alot of time to learn how to play you cant just turn your mind off and run around. The tutorial isn't up to snuff to teach new players and the community (fairly) doesnt have time to teach ya the ropes. I can see once you learn the game that it would be an exciting and fun game, but that learning difficulty curve needs to be addressed by the devteam.  Maybe making an option for newbs for them to play single player against bots similar to what operation harsh doorstep does,  so they can learn the ropes. Otherwise it would be a long grind to learn the game, letting down your team mates as you learn everything.  I got my refund to the game because the learning curve is too steep."
Not fun. Arma is better.
every single server its unfriendly to new players..totally disaster..they buy this crap and they thing they are godfathers now who can be toxic and stupid to all new players..disaster from community.. your parents miss when they grow such a racist kids like you are.. shame on your parents work !!
iF YOUR LOOKING FOR A GAME THAT HAS 0 OPTIMIZATION YOUVE COME TO THE RIGHT PLACE... also if you wanna get down a building watch out for invisible awnings and doors.
"This game is many things. Fun, thats not."
"This game is full of Virgins. Spend the whole time being kicked from every available squad for absolutely no reason, to the point i didn't actually get to experience the gameplay."
I run around for ten minutes. I get shot at. I look around for a while and don't see anything. I die. Every time. You move slow and clunky. Can't refund. Don't Play.
"i would refund if i could, i had 1 hour along time ago and I refunded bc I couldn't run the game and was stuck in it for 1 hour now I have the game again bc I got a better PC and the game sucks and now I have more than 2 hours and I cant refund it, games ass"
"TERRIBLE OPTIMIZATION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
RTX 3090 + 5900X + 2K + ALL LOW = 30FPS average

WTF?"
Squad is the kind of game you have to hate yourself to enjoy. It just is not fun.
"60 hours in, and I still never see the people shooting me. Play if you like spending and hour doing nothing, for 30 minutes of spawning and dieing immediately over and over again."
"its changed for the worse its not the same and the gameplay is shit, servers are either dead or half dead"
"Squad honestly just isn't really fun. It suffers from the same issues Hell Let Loose has, but more magnified. If you spawn away from the fight or your squad you're gonna spend a lot of time hoofing it across the map just to get to a fight, and whenever you do get to the fight you die before you even realize what's happening.
Sure, it's 'realistic' but it's generally a negative experience running around only to get killed in .2 seconds.
The ticket system seems to make most matches turn into 'who can score the most kills from across the map to win""
It's not fun running around reviving dudes while you're being completely suppressed for something like 30 minutes straight.
Also the community is either ""lets ban you for not wanting to play squad lead"" to ""Yeah man, a good piece of advice is to look up factions fatigues"" so if you're planning on playing this game solo expect an irksome time there. I think to actually enjoy this game you need a full squad of people to coordinate anything, which even then, only really mediates the admin side of the game's issues.
Just pickup insurgency, HLL or even Tarkov if you want a more enjoyable experience. At least with those games you'll actually be playing a *game* 
Lastly, the game does indeed run like crap, I love stuttering whenever I get shot, to make my suppression even more irritating to experience."
"This game is by no means enjoyable by any standard. I bought this game back in the day before i could run it and since getting a good computer I tried to play it. In my attempt to play this game i can say that the community is one of the worst I've ever experienced in my life, its worse than COD hell even worse than CS2. The servers are usually run by clans with power abusing admins and even though a server might say ""new player friendly"" they are anything but. I tried running a few matches with my buddy only to have my class stripped from me while in the middle of a fire fight with a server warning covering my screen telling me ""you're not a high enough level to use this class"" or ""You will be banned in 2 minutes if you do not join a squad (keep in mind all squads were full) so i was left high and dry with no gun and no ammo surrounded by enemies. If you play and enjoy this garbage congrats! but if you're looking to get into it don't bother unless you're a sadist or masochist."
"Game was great. Has been flooded with new players that think its CoD, not worth playing anymore unfortunately. I and several SL's agree and have hung the game up for the next few months.

Amazing game, when its played right (communicate, coordinate) as the intro video explains..."
"This game is branded as a tactical shooter, but it is not. It feels like a slightly more tactical Battlefield which is fine, if you like that gameplay but I do not."
This game runs like the slowest kid in fat camp for it looking so generic generic  0/10
"I deeply regret purchasing this game. The online gameplay is nothing like the advertised experience, and the community feels lifeless, offering no support to new players or fostering the teamwork the game is supposedly designed for.

Squad’s core gameplay revolves around fighting a war alongside a squad of up to nine players, including a squad leader responsible for directing members and placing map markers for infantry, vehicles, and bases.

Unfortunately, due to the stale and unwelcoming community, nearly every squad leader locks their squads at the start of a round, allowing only friends or experienced players to join. This leaves new players unable to properly participate unless they create their own squad and take on the squad leader role—a daunting and frustrating experience for beginners, which often results in backlash from other players due to a lack of experience.

The gameplay itself consists largely of frustration. You’ll spend most of your time getting shot at, causing your screen to darken and blur, rendering you effectively blind about 75% of the time before dying. Upon respawning, you'll often find yourself far from the objective, with vehicles locked to squad leaders, forcing you to run long distances just to get back into the action. Once there, you're likely to be taken out again by infantry hiding in bushes at long distances or the overwhelming number of enemy tanks, repeating the same tedious cycle.

In my 12 hours of play, I’ve only encountered three enemy soldiers. The rest of my time was spent crawling toward objectives and getting shot at from no where or getting shelled while attempting to build bases. Match queues are excessively long—expect to wait over 10 minutes in a 25-player line just to join one of the few active servers. The matches themselves are disappointingly short, with most of your time spent running around, only for the game to end suddenly due to an invisible scoring system.

The logistics element is simplistic and repetitive, involving nothing more than driving a truck from one point to another. There’s no weapon or loadout customization to add variety or depth to the experience.

You’d be far better off investing in games like Arma 3, Reforger, or Foxhole. 
Squad is a hollow, frustrating experience that pretends to be a deep mil-sim by simply blinding you whenever you’re shot. I deeply regret purchasing this game—it’s nothing like the advertised experience, and the unhelpful, unwelcoming community completely undermines any potential for enjoyable gameplay."
bad
"Ich habe mir Squad zugelegt, weil ich als Arma 3 Spieler so langsam nicht mehr auf die alte Grafik von Arma klar komme. Da liefert Squad extrem ab. Super realistische Grafik.  Allerdings war der Hauptgrund für mich der teamplay Aspekt. Anders als angepriesen, habe ich den in 4 Stunden Gameplay nicht gefunden. 

- Es gibt zu wenig deutsche Server und man sitzt teilweise 30 Minuten oder mehr in ner Warteschlange und 
   kann nur joinen, wenn der Server eine neue Map wählt und sowieso alle neu connecten.

- Die squadleader unter denen ich gespielt habe, verstehen nicht wie man kommuniziert, bzw. geben keine Befehle aus. Besonders nervig, wenn man einen Server joint, der ""new player friendly"" in der Beschreibung stehen hat.  Letztendlich bin ich einfach anderen hinterher gelaufen aber nie meinem Squad. Man sitzt zusammen in einer Deckung, dreht sich um und alle sind auf ein mal weg. Anstatt kurz über voice zu sagen dass man die Stellung wechselt, wird hier einfach drauf geschissen.  Die meisten Leute sind außerdem so inkompetent in dem Spiel, dass sie nicht dazu in der Lage sind den Kompass zu benutzen um Gegner zu callen aber haben alle ein riesen Ego, fühlen sich wie die geilsten. Wie immer hier die deutsche community super cringe, absolute Testosteronbude die anscheinend von 50 Jahre alten, 4 mal geschiedenen Dudes zum kompensieren gespielt wird.  Das was das Spiel ausmacht, nämlich die Squad-Mechanik wird in der Kommunikation absolut nicht ausgenutzt. Dementsprechend bezieht sich der so angepriesene Realismus hier eher auf das Aussehen des Spiels und Gunplay, beides Faktoren die super umgesetzt sind. 
Alles in allem ist Squad zudem extrem langweilig. Rumsitzen, in eine Richtung starren aus der vielleicht mal jemand kommen könnte... 

Technisch könnte das Spiel definitv noch nachlegen. Mit einem 5800 X3D und einer 3080 in WQHD und Mid/High settings habe ich knapp 120 fps erreicht, bis ich die Optik auf meiner Waffe benutzt habe. Die werden Picture in Picture gerendert und das führt zu extremen Fps einbrüchen bis in die 60er. 

Fazit: Ich habe von Squad anderes erwartet. Dynamischeres Teamplay. Aber ich bin durch Arma auch Milsim
verwöhnt, dementsprechend bin ich nicht unbiased. 

Bin leider 4 Stunden im Spiel gewesen, dementsprechend kein Refund. Pech gehabt. 

Kauft euch Arma Reforger und installiert mods. Habt ihr mehr von und die Community is netter!"
"This game could be great if it had a few more weapons and a little bit of customization, have to be very patient to play."
The mic issues with this game can make it hard to play. Theres compatibility issues in this game when it works on your device. Game also has a very difficult screen rate. Other than that its a fun game.
lol
"Great game, but the community has gone to shit. Constant trolling, and people not working together/communicating has made what used to be my favorite game into my least favorite. Free weekends and discounts on the game have completely ruined it."
Honestly it just keeps randomly kicking me from games and its frustrating to enjoy it then be kicked every game
Just go play Arma 3 instead
"Poorly optimized, glitchy and overall bad game. Too many European servers with stinky ping and really poop communities that literally ban you for no reason. So the idea of the game is to encourage being toxic? Wow, never thought a developer would go that low. Although I only played it for a little bit, I really don't recommend. I had a horrible experience on multiple servers. I tried to like it and I tried to look beyond the flaws but there's too many. Go for Arma."
arma reforger is better this is just a  temu version of it
Надеюсь у фанатов этой игры всё хорошо.
only good with mods
"was great game when it is working, came back to it after a break and now game is unplayable. cant skip intro video and ue4 crashes, no known permanent fix exists per google searching. wish could get money back."
"A lot of people seem to like this game but I found it pretty boring, not how the gameplay videos make it out to be at all."
devs gobble lady cock
"Be prepared to be head shot 500m away, while you cant see further then 20 yards with your scope. The gun sway is excessive and you cant walk further then 10 yards without being gassed."
not very good game
"1. Badly optimized, extremely VRAM hungry, crashed every time during map change and twice during matches with error something something ran out of VRAM (minimum on the store page is 4GB, I have 6).

Using:
-12th gen i7-12700H
-16GB RAM
-M2 SSD drive
-RTX 3060 laptop gpu (6GB dedicated VRAM)
I would say there is something wrong with my laptop and not the game, but games like Helldivers 2 with highier requirements run flawlessly + 1 of my friends has the same issue. Ran the game on lowest settings, with and without DLSS.

2.If you want to play the game with friends, and you do want to play this game with friends, you need to find a server with a few open slots, 90% of servers are either full or dead. This means that 9 out of 10 times if you want to play an actual game you have to wait in queue. Server hosts can and do introduce a paid priority queue that skips the main queue entirely (even though every other implementation of such system I've seen in my life takes 1 person from priority then 1 from main and so on so people in main aren't just stuck in there forever. How does Squad deal with this problem? It doesn't.) If the server you want to join is full, or, God forbid, you crashed mid game (perhaps due to running out of VRAM even though you have more than in minimum requirements, nah that would never happen) you are stuck waiting for a good 20 minutes (1 match) and if you somehow manage to not die from old age and join, the game ends, map changes AND DURING LOADING IT F*****G CRASHES AGAIN, OUT OF VRAM ERROR MY A** I HAVE 6 GIGS YOU SAY 4 RIGHT THERE ON THE STORE PAGE, UNIRONICALLY 2.5 OUT OF 3 HOURS I HAVE IN THIS GAME WAS SPENT IN QUEUE.

3.So I spent the refund period in queues. (I don't want to refund the game, I'm just pointing that fact out, still want to try playing when I get round to buying a PC). That wouldn't happen if I got to test the game made for playing with friends through family share, a steam feature that explicitly doesn't allow you to play with the copy owner. So what is the problem? Why didn't I do it? Because for no f****** reason family share is disabled. WHERE IS THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST?? If I want to play with my friend I still have to purchase a separate copy!

4.So this is my 3 argument essay on why you should play Roblox Multicrew Tank Combat instead (It actually has a batter vehicle damage model, which in Squad is pretty basic). Game still better than Hell Let Loose though."
I love playing this game but it literally doesn't run on my computer(not performance issues). Upon starting the game it instantly stops responding in task manager and plays the shitty intro cinematic while infinitely loading yet nothing is bottle necking and I don't believe its my computer I have a 3060ti 32gb ram and an i9-10900KF. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling many times verifying game files and yes my drivers are up to date. I hope that this issue is fixed so that I am able to play again. Also I am on windows ten I haven't switched yet but I don't think that would solve my issue.
"Is it hard to make a game work? like for real? Finding servers is a pain in the ass and it sometimes work. You waste 15 minutes of finding servers after you wasted 2 hours trying to fix the game yourself browsing Reddit or any other site to find a solution to the ,,no servers found"" shit.  AND AFTER THAT, YOU FUCK AROUND WITH ANOTHER BUG, THE ONE THAT WRITES ,,UNABLE TO JOIN SERVER SESSION. and at this point you wasted not only your money, but time.  

0 wasted hours out of 10"
"When I first purchased this game, it was fantastic. Now, with each new update and hotfix, I experience more and more issues. They recently added a hotfix that makes it so I am unable to join any servers, and half of the time, none of the servers even appear despite several refreshes. I cannot recommend this game in it's current state."
"game costs 50 bucks and cant even load into a server, if you can even find one. Trash"
LOL
this game is so trash for vehicle combat due to the trees being invincible and the rocks being the most slippery surface man ever encountered
No in game Audio...

downloaded and voice chat does not work cant talk to my squad and i tried everything to get it to work very shit game
"PLEASE read this… if you are looking for a strategy and team work game this is perfect. In contrast this game is not to be played for fun unless you have fun doing that. if you are looking for a open world shooter where you drive and loot and kill people then you need to get dayz or call of duty dmz this game is fine, but it’s very difficult to play and have fun if your not really into strategy games"
"i highly recommend to avoid this game.

Its is a fun game to actually play, its just the other people that play it that ruin the experience. i really tried to enjoy the game but i just couldn't because of the man babies that get pissed off if you don't do something they say. And then if you start to ignore said man babies you get turned into Abraham Lincoln by getting shot in the back of the head by said man babies."
this game sucks
fix your game from crashing out
"Don't ever join a 1stRB server, or 3rd, ever, such dogshit admins on there that will give a 7 day ban for accidentally typing in all chat about your HAB when it was intended for Squad, then it fucks you on every other server even though they have zero connection, the whole communitybanlist is such a stupid fucking idea it ruins everything."
WTF WHY DO U GET KICKED FOR JUST GETTING IN VEHICLE 2 man crew KITS SUCK FAT GIGA CUCKS PLEASE WTF BEST GAMEIVE EVER HAD ABOUT TO LOSE AND I JUST NEEDED TO GET A VEHICLE TO ANOTYHER PART OF THE MAP BUTY NO SQUAD TELLS U NO U HAVE TO START RUNNING LIKE BITCH FUCK U SQUAD BUT ALSO LOVE U FUCKS IRS IS COMPLICATED
"As a new player who played similar games such as Hell let lose the game is bad. For me the UI is complicated, there are no on screen markers which makes it very difficult for me to navigate, and I can't see the difference between teammate and enemy. I don't want to take hours to sit and learn uniforms and what are the key differences! Don't even get me started on the gun play... It's god awful since your ""soldier"" has the arm strength of a newborn baby. It's like he has gummy worms for arms. Gun play is not realistic at all and that's coming form a guy that's been in the special forces. Aiming with scopes is a pain in the ass and the bullet spread is horrendous. It's like shooting confetti, not bullets. Optimization wise A HUGE CATASTROPHE. I have a very high end PC and I get huge frame drops. On Cyberpunk for example at max settings with ray tracing I get around 90-100 FPS in 4K, but on this game I have 20 at times. HOW? Would not recommend to anyone."
F the people who play this
Not Recommended
go play battlefield or go play arma insurgancy any other game this game isnt worth it
"terrible game cant see anything scopes take up your whole screen and if you use a iron sight good luck its 90% of your screen. movement is wack, and the key bindings are horrible. hell let loose is 100% better"
hell let loose is much better.
It could be a good game if it wasn't so terribly optimised.
"the game is cool, but matches take too long start"
"where am i, who is that, im dead"
Played this game for a long time and it was my favorite shooter with the best tactical elements that i couldnt find anywhere else. I stopped playing just before the ICO. Now reinstalling the game i cant get past the 10 minute intro video to play the game. it goes thru the video then just stays a black loading screen forever. Restarting causes the video to replay and its unskippable. Unplayable for me.
dogshit performance

"game is a cpu vampire, really good and fun gameplay but if you dont have a top tier cpu ur not gonna get more than 60 frames, no matter the settings"
Community is cancer
fucking hate this game i wanted a refound and they waited so long that its not even posible now
"very first game got yelled at for a player because i didnt know what to do.

1/10 would never play again."
"I really want to like this game, but every match is filled with locked squads or filled ones. Probably a lot of fun if you have friends or can actually get into a squad."
"I like this game and the modding scene but hackers are taking over this game and makes it unplayable.  I don't even understand why they're doing it but they are, almost every other match or every match people are being shot through walls, the next points are already known and so you can't defend them.  I really hope they work on the anti cheat in this game because what ever team has the hacker(s) is winning normally.  A close friend even shut down his server for squad because he started having to ban hackers every day and instead of it being a fun let's hop on the server it became he had to monitor it all the time so it didn't become a dead server since in the last year hackers just keep springing up.  Love the game but something needs to be done about the hackers in this."
Hell Let Loose if it was bad
"Of course, it has interesting and positive aspects, but mixed with many ridiculous and irrealistic elements and as a game it's unnecessarily overcomplicated. But the worst part is the typically cocky, toxic players.

However, on the whole it gives back realisticly what it is usually like to serving in an army:

Serving in an army is usually extremely tiresome, miserable, unfair, or at the best it's highly boring."
"Mediocre at best. Game is incredibly slow both in gameplay and physically with characters and vehicles. Roles at so restrictive its punitive, and anything that isnt a basic rifleman or vehicle oriented classes is snagged immediately. 

I gave this game so many chances, and it just plain SUCKS. Don't waste your money, this game is just for military n3rds creaming their pants over proper camo patterns for different nations."
ICO ruined it for me. No matter how you slice it its just a worse experience than before.
servers dont show up ive tried 4 times the last year and not a single server. i shouldnt have to fix shit in your game for it to work. dont waste your money
forgot to refund this :steamsad:
"can't distinguish much from my squad or enemy, I hate TK my squad, fix this SHIT!"
fully ruined the combat shooting feels like im holding my gun one handed. make squad great again
"I bought squad and im new to game, I accidentally tk some people but in my end i was apologize but when i try to load into servers it auto kicks me and tells me im vac banned? Is this how the game treats New players?"
worse than squad 44 that's for sure
"It's no longer the game I spent countless hours on, I don't recommend purchasing it. For those looking for a simulator, look elsewhere."
shit ico
"suppression, ADS idle sway +3000%"
"Why am I not seeing any servers?

Squad 44 the servers show right away.

In this its just endless loading or a loop"
"[h1] Extra toxic game [/h1]

This is a multiplayer game, the player base resembles Red Dead Online RP. That's enough said for people who know."
"This game is not worth 50$.
It runs very poorly and only the explosion particles look good.
This game also has no decent Anti Aliasing , you either get none or TAA which makes everthing blurry including your scope."
bad optimization clunkily movement that is a chore to deal with. clunky horrible slow animations that are infuriating to deal with. a wannabe hyper realistic shooter
"looks like a fun game. But i have entered 14 different servers and just cant seem to play it normally my ping is around 35 to 50 yet i cant seem to walk anywhere without going back where i started after 10 seconds maybe i have gone 2 meters but it is unplayable.

if you read this and can help me with this problem please do i would like to play the game until then i would not recommend the game as you can probably understand because now for me at least its a waste of money"
"can yall make it so i 100% know who the enemy is, my first game today ive had died everytime becuase i keep thinking the enemies are my squad mates. the only difference is are the guns..."
sosal
"Saw all the hype and influencers promoting this game so I finally bought it on sale. Regret. 

It's basically a stripped down, poor man's version of BF3/BF4. The movement, weapons handling, and everything else about the game is cheap and clunky, even vaulting over a small wall is a challenge. This game is inconsistently semi-realistic, meaning your teammates will have ally tags above their head, but not all the time, and not when they are more than 20ft away. Also if they enter a room you're in, the tag will only appear after a few seconds. Why don't the developers just leave the tags, or remove them completely? Because of this lazy design, teamkills are a normal thing, and the only solution is to open your map overlay every few seconds to keep track of allies. Wow that's so realistic. It's worse that modern armies are featured, so all the uniforms look exactly the same. In the forum, players talk about how to distinguish the subtle colours and equipment smh. 

A big thing that I was looking forward to were all the mods that the influencers have been pushing, but it's a scam. Unlike Battlefield, this game HAS NO PUBLIC SERVERS. Yes that's right. There are only a small amount of  privately run ones, by 'clans' smh. Want to play the zombie mode? Fat chance because nobody runs that server anymore. It only exists on youtube. The developers obviously paid alot of influencers to push this. How did we regress so badly, and how are people supporting this? The gunplay and gameplay is also crap. When you get shot at, your screen shakes violently, turns black, and goes out of focus for several seconds. Killing enemies does not feel satisfying either, maybe with the major ICO nerf, it just took all the feeling out of everything.

Weapon balance is also crap, most loadouts do not have any anti armour weapons. If you do choose a class with a basic rpg, the game will penalize that class and take away your holo scope for example. This game is simply not fun or realistic either. Don't even buy this at 95% off. Getting a refund now. 

ps - For the poop icing on the flavourless sponge cake? It crashes randomly too. Good job."
Optimization is suck.i have 4060ti 8gb and ryzen 5 7600f medium graphic sometimes i see 40fps. but good
"Experiences with player base were horrid, constantly coming across toxic people who are just not pleasant what so ever. Particularly as a new player, I just got fucked with and treated awful."
"Can't recommend the game until they rework the awful flight model, add basic QOL improvements like choosing which seat to enter, fix the utterly frustrating bipod mechanics, and rework at least one of the several abandoned game modes.
The game is extremely resource heavy and regularly crashes due to OOM, consuming 16gb of memory just to load some levels. Of course, enjoy waiting for another 20 minutes to queue into the server after that crash. 
Another basic aspect is that being a squad leader feels like a thankless and frustrating task without much of any infrastructure to command and control besides pointing at a location."
needs allot of optimisation it's unplayable in some maps and servers
"Стреляешь из пулемёта - пули летят куда угодно кроме цели. Тебя ранят в транспорте, полечить себя в нём нельзя. В тебя кто-то попал, игра нек показывает стрелочку откуда прилетело. Как минимум в жизнт я понимаю что прилетает в левую руку. Бред."
"j'y ai joué 4 heures pour 27 crashes, je recommande pas"
It was fun when it worked but now I cant play modded anymore because it makes me stuck in this stupid trailer.
Servers don't load
IT IS HARD EXP HOW DO YOU PAGE UP FOR YOUR TEMATES.
>:(
Imagine making a game about being in a Squad but you can't get in a Squad with a friend without RNG. Yeah good job autistic devs.
You can't drive over the pedestrian! Fuck it
"definitely not the game i was expecting. trash teams, cant identify who your enemy is, and the fact that you cant pick up left over ammo and other things of that nature of dead bodies is obsured. horrible game"
"Worse than Arma, the scope is constantly shaking, you can't see anything, the community is inadequate and toxic. Also constant freezes on 7 9700x and 4070 xddddddd"
i have the recommended specs for this game yet i only manage to get 40 to 50 fps this game is poorly optimized
"Waited the 17 hours you see above this review waiting for the game to load in
I was really goddamn hoping to play the star wars mod but i guess that won't happen"
"The game is too poorly optimized and is having FPS issues, as well as some issue with black screen, FPS drops and poor performace EVEN IN THE LOWEST SETTING WITH SUPER LOW END GRAPHICS.

I have other newer games with better visuals then this one and none of them consumed as much reasources as this game, so the issue has to be on this game in particular.

According to a friend of mine, this issue came after some infantry-centered patch and something that was done on it that made the game far more demanding and less optimized.

Well, i want to get back at this game in the future, but for the moment, i'm refunding it."
"Wait, run, die, wait, run, die. Walking/waiting sim 2006"
i have UEA 4 crash ??
Dont try if you use a xbox controller as it may say it has support but it doesnt.
no
"honestly a fun game it really is but when u cant find any matches it makes u not wanna play, the server browser is absolutely  terrible it loads maybe every once in a while, finding a match itself through the ""find match"" option?? i tried everything google said and to no avail it did not work. if u can get the game to play its fun, maybe they will fix it soon"
ث
"Painful to play

I just bought this game for 20 on a sale, load it up all excited, get through the tutorials, then I get into the actual game where I have to suffer from severe stuttering. I keep trying to fix this which led me to write this review warning people about buying this game. Graphics issue after graphics issue, I find myself losing it due to the fact that I would need a PC that would put NASA's administrator on his knees and in tears.

My PC runs on Windows 11, I have an AMD Ryzen 5 5500 processor with 3.60 GHz. One more thing that I have is 16 GB of RAM installed in this PC. But the biggest thing to say and what has a connection with this game is that, this system struggles to maintain FPS and have good performance or my performance is good, but the environment looks like it was made out of clay, same with the people I am playing this game with. 

I tried to reach out to support via email, but I didn't get a response yet. I just you to take the 20 dollars and buy some other game with it, that you know it will run and it will run well.

If you have any solutions for this madness as my PC has no more slots for RAM, please write this down in the comments and help me out as I don't really want to just give up on this game."
I had factories in factorio better optimized than this game
Отличный симулятор больного тремором!!!
have to have a people who play or u never have fun and after 10 hours just trying to find a team regret

"I wouldn't buy this game until you try it out in a free to play weekend.
Not enough time to explore what the game has to offer within the refund period.

What I did find out in my small amount of play time is that there were 4 main servers for AU for new players, each having quite a large wait queue time, or you can join a server with 4 people and accomplish nothing. I spent 20 minutes waiting to join a server.

There is no customisation for load-outs and certain settings server or mode based limit class types.
I like limiting class types within squads but no across all squads.

No customisation feels so bad, 3 predetermined rifleman load-outs and I hate every single scope forced option, the good thing about most other shooters is you can fiddle around to choose a scope to your personal preferred visual clarity.
I unfortunately can't look past this 1 thing regardless of everything else.

I also felt like this was a safe buy to try due to high positive review counts but it appears the developers within their discord made promises to release ""leaked"" future content screenshots if players updated their negative reviews to positive, perhaps from the insulting DLC's. DLC's which are gun skins fixed to map type for ""keeping it realistic"". Wouldn't by their own claims that this would mean that skins should be different to all guns and armour per map type by the default game design and not a paid for option? But I guess this is what happens when a company sells out to Tencent.

TLDR: Wait for free weekend. Not enough time actually try the game out properly."
It won't let you load in the game most of the time.
i give the game chance after chance and still it is dogshit
Known issues with the cinematic being unable to be skipped without deleting files.
just another bullshit serverlist war game
"blinding suppression and noodle hands, and creepy ppl believe that this helps for teamwork while actually you become a bunch of noodle handed snails trying to play team-play tactics that actually ending by getting blown and in the end of match you check tab to see that 60% of players have 0 kills and lot of deaths, GE mod is the only light in this game."
Doesn't scratch the military shooter itch.
"well there weren't many players from my region so i had to compromise and join one where i had over 80 ping
the server had 90+ player but after capturing 3 points and playing for almost a hour never saw any enemy
and when i was abt to leave some dude just sniped 3-4 of us instantly and we didnt knew where the shots were from

not recommended for new players
play battlfield games for better experience
was a waste of time because i have refunded it"
"I was really interested in this game, but after installing and running, it the game had no sound after the intro, only popping noises.  Tried verifying game files, and following other solutions I found online, but nothing worked.  I saw other people with similar problems who never got support on the forums or from the developers, so I requested a refund.  Not spending forever trying to fix it."
The game stutters and runs poorly; I can't play it because it's poorly optimized.
borings its a walking sim dont get it
Mic doesnt work and these guys dont want to either fix it or give you any kind of instant link to customer support to help you through it. Its just internet searches to no end with no solution.
"shit game, need COOP or BOT. those players are toxic."
no way this is popular
doesn't have jiggle physics
"Absolutely terrible. Takes forever to get into a game with decent ping, and then if you don't know what you're doing it is the most confusing game I have ever played. Only buy if you have someone who knows what they are doing. Otherwise not worth the money even if it is on sale."
"10 bad boring games where my squad will run around the map for 1 hour before losing for every 1 good fun game, im getting tired of it"
Performance despite exceeding recommended Specs
"Mostly Russians who demand you have a mic to communicate. I was kicked from servers with the reasoning being that I'm a troll, when in reality, I'm just new and trying to learn the game. I requested a refund."
"This game is pure trash

used to be good a few years ago

the ICO - infantry combat overhaul has made the weapons EXTREMELY unrealistic

you can just google the recoil patterns, but when you fire an M4, in game, it literally, and i mean LITERALLY, kicks to the sky. this is not an over-exaggeration

an M4, in real life, has little recoil, just like every other ar-15 platform rifles. in squad, PVP is pure RNG, the stamina system giving your character parkinsons is also another horrible implementation. in squad, its about whoever just sits prone in a random spot.

there is no skill, there is no fun. 

just go play Hell Let Loose, that game has ACTUAL proper gunplay."
looked very fun. but i was not able to join any servers to play. so i had to refund the game. luckily the in game micro transaction store still worked..........
"Got the game, hoping to play Galactic Contention. Do all the steps and then search up the required tag in the server browser. Never shows up. I looked on their Discord and found you may need to repeatedly spam refresh for it to work as apparently the server browser doesn't work. Ok, so I decided to check first if I try to browse without the mod installed and search something to see if the issue persists.. It does... Ok I sit there for 2 minutes clicking refresh, leave for 16 minutes to make food and come back to it loading... Ok I sit there for another 5 spamming refresh to no avail after multiple restarts and then it dawned on me that I bought a finger cramping simulator.

BS that an issue that has been around for apparently months hasn't been resolved.

Edit: After a long while, I came back to the game and it worked this time (hurrah), base game itself seems decent enough. Not something that would keep me personally. However, the Star Wars mod Galactic Contention is brilliantly done and definitely made purchasing Squad worth it."
"IDK, i would play this game way more often if the weapon and recoil system just didn't suck as bad. Like your'e telling me if i hipfire my weapon, by the third shot im hitting the ceiling 5 feet infront of me? I would have to be looking straight down to control my recoil enough to actually hit my target. Whether you can manage to ignore the bad recoil system or not, a bad recoil system is still a bad recoil system. Doesnt change what it is if you just cope with it. I just want my shots to land in the same zip code without having to look at the ground to make it happen."
1 hour was enough for me to see that this game is absolute dog water. Why is vehicle movement so awful? Why does it take 10 seconds to aim down sight? This game may be the FURTHEST milsim shooter I have ever played. You're better off play Reforger.
"I didn't get hooked on it; a lot of my mates love the game, but it felt to me that you need many hours in before it becomes fun. Maybe I'll come back to it another time, put in those hours, and see if this is true."
Game crashes every time I try to do just about anything
"I love Squad but I cannot in all rights and principles give it a good review, the dev's have ran it into the ground and back peddled on every single aspect. Performance, Game play, Everything. You name it. Its gone completely downhill!"
make sure you have friends before you buy it
"Incomprehensible. Also it looks ugly. It doesn't look bad, it looks ugly."
Game is far worse than demo
"Bad
Men of war better!"
people
shit keeps crashing. Cant have a single fun game without a crash in the middle. Lowkey fucks up the whole experience. 100 hous lter and its the same fucking thing. Just constant crashes.
a total waste of money!!! get ready for you gun to wobble around while trying to kill an enemy. movement sucks and the audio is god awful. just get hell let loose
donts spend your money on this guys not worth it maybe if it will go down to 1-3$
This game blow's major peiner
now worth it its hard to find a team and peaple are toxic
"absolute worst movement i have ever experienced in any online game. everything involved from aiming, to running, hell even crouching feels like im wearing a giant diaper full of baby shit. the only thing comparable to any other game is maybe the audio of gunshots... aside from that... squad isnt worth youre time or money... and i got it from cd keys for the low."
"this game was good and fun before the china update. after that. downhill.  Animations are worse. The aiming it dogshit. 
YOU CAN BE PRONE AND YOUR GUN SWAYS MORE THAN A BOAT. 
A tiny pistol sways  more than a drunk person."
"Called squad but you can't actually just queue up to join a game together, kinda comical. 

There's a lot of claims of realism but the fact is your characters vision starts to blur to near blindness if anyone is shooting near you. Yeah... this game is bad."
"Don't buy this scam, the game run horribly to the point that it's unplayable the recommended specs are nowhere near enough for this game to run at an acceptembe fps."
"Awful game.  Huge maps so you spend most of your time walking to your teammates who left you behind.  You must play in squads; no one wants to be squad leader so you get promoted to squad leader position … oop, not so fast Pilgrim … you do not have a squad leader kit and will now be kicked from the squad.  Enjoy the long walk back.  Just an all-around awful game."
"As played this game last couple of days,and see others paly this game on YouTube it look all great and seems to go the correct way to compare it to reality it's a thumb 👍 😀 I give it on the correct path. However this game in general come to players is 100% toxic to say. Don't feel welcome, be kick out if don't follow orders and can't be in a vehicle if the squad leader doesn't want you be in a vehicle by yourself. Always have to be in a squad not by yourself. Wannabe squad leaders,and players take this game way to serious 😤 this is not a joke be aware of this. This needs to be dealt with not take stuff so serious to say. Just a game. I just don't recommend this game to all to say. Stay away from this game just really toxic,until it's resolved."
"Combat overhaul makes playing a chore.
Trying to ADS is unnecessarily cumbersome with the animation doing some round about BS.
Suppressive fire is 10x worse than Battlefield 3 some how and makes combat encounters extremely one sided and impossible to return fire. to make matters worse is you'll flinch at random rounds flying from across the map lmao."
Squad community ban list and badmins ruin the game
"I understand there is a 2 hour policy but this game is so technical AND SLOW that you would need to spend at least 2 hours deciding if it was even any fun.
1 GAME is 2 hours long!
The training can be close to 2 hours long.
Walking because you can't run for more than 100m is eating into the 2 hour time.

The reason this game is awful though is the players that have been playing it. What made me quit is I asked a question that albeit I should have learned in the training, I forgot for that moment and so I asked another squad that was requesting my help. The response was telling me to go fuck myself and redo training which I spent about 2+ hours (not including hours of YouTube videos). Then they tried to kill me.

For a game that should be about working together, you will find that IF you decide to ""work as a team,"" what that really takes on to mean is you will be doing bitch work that no one wants to do. This game is a dumpster fire waiting to explode because you either ARE a toxic player breaking simple rules or you BECOME a toxic player bullying and threatening new players until they give up.

As a 14 year EOD combat veteran, this game had so much promise to actually work as a team and trust hardworking players in a competitive milsim but in the end it's a broken game where banned-CoD players show up to piss off people who seek to escape from real life stress for a positive game because they essentially hate social interactions."
"One of the early backers here, this piece of garbage is my biggest regret among any projects I supported. It used to be a worse Project Reality, now even the their suits don't know what kind of games they want it to be. After so many years, instead of making something new like a proper PVE experience or a sandbox mode, they are selling skins and emotes, treating it like another generic twitch shooter, shilling for Chicom and became a massive sell out. Additionally, the devs have no idea what they are doing, this product has gone through multiple overhauls, at one point, they want it to be a successor to PR, but that is no longer the case not long after the game's release, then they wanted it to be a competitive shooter, so they started balancing and tweaking things in their favour, but competitive shooters soon started to fade out, and then they watched a bunch of recent war videos and decided to turn the game into a hardcore milsim with the infantry change and all, this pretty much tell you how soulless these people are, their CEO and executives don't care about your experience or enjoyment, all they want is more money into their pocket, following popular trend, turn it to another slop in the market, selling more skins and emotes, oh, and shilling for a totalitarian regime, why don't you just sign a contract with PLA and providing them your product as a training tool at this point? 

If you haven't bought this crap, just get Arma 3 if you had any money to spare, BI is a lot more based than these cucks, if not, go download Project Reality, it's free and better. This product (I wouldn't even call it a game) is nothing but a generic soulless slop and an empty shell."
"honestly the game itself is great, really enjoyable. But i feel like i need to make this review so people are aware just how toxic the community is. In my first 10 hours the amount of slurs ive heard yelled over comms makes MW2 lobbies blush, Russians everywhere are astounded by the creativity of the american mind when it comes to making up derogatory terms for minorities, I think ive been called a fa**ot more times in here than I did as a gay kid in high school which is astounding. The game is superb though and captures that realistic and tactical feeling without making guns a pain to shoot so I do recommend the game to an extent, just be wary if you dont have thick skin and are any kind of minority."
People are goofy not in a good way... combat is ass
"Very steep learning curve and less-than-forgiving community. I wish I could just go 3/5 stars, but steam only has 2 options smh"
"Very good game, unique even
But I cannot recommend it right now ( End of year 2024) because how bad the optimization has become over the years
PiP update, lightning update never addressed the optimization problems created
Performances over various setups also feels random, which is frustrating"
"Extremely toxic community. Players joke about rape, pedophilia, jews and homosexuals. I was expecting teamwork, I got the opposite and toxic talk. Unacceptable!"
"No matter what I do, I can't solve the steam offline error."
"Another milsim loserfest for fruits who prefer to sit around chit chatting and running for miles on foot (just to get sniped) rather than actually enjoying combat and shooting enemies. As with all milsim games, it could be awesome if it didnt require so much ridiculous effort to actually see some combat."
Came back after three years and infantry combat in this game has been made so much less enjoyable.
Garbage
"ok lets go, first 3 hours in game was =

"Played the game fore three hours, didn't enjoy a single second of it."
dog shit
i had high hopes to much movement when shooting  aim idle sway is bad brightnest on dessert maps is bad cant see far and why cant everynoe get to change there guns to how it will help them not be limited because some one picked a gun before they could.
no
"Do not play this game if you enjoy shooting guns at other people, they made it a chore and as annoying as possible"
worst game i  ever spend money on
"have the developers ever shot or even held a live firearm?
the game was better before the update"
not for me
"Didn't cheat and was banned for no reason, guess someone was butthurt for losing in a combat. Good to know they are adding all kinds of weird stuff now."
this shit is so ass
It was a great game until they added the bots.
game is to hard just bonkers
bad many bugs
"my pc just sucks, it crashes when i try to join a match"
You can't see shit in the distance and scopes are awful.
crashes and runs like shite
My 80 year old grandmother can control this bloody gun better than these myasthenia gravis soldiers
makes you watch a dogshit 5min video everytime you launch the game

HI IM EMAN

"Player base is mostly Steam sale teenagers. New players have destroyed the game. Exceptionally toxic teenager base. They play like it's COD and vehemently oppose any real tactics or squad direction. New players are refusing to learn game mechanics as well. N bombs, homophobia, and general racism is running rampant. The game has its moments, but is overwhelmingly outweighed by the sheer volume of low skilled and deliberately toxic players. 

K/D has replaced playing the objective. I would steer away from this title. I will be exploring other options."
"Community is 50% decent and the other 50% are elitist losers who think their gazillion hours in squad mean they can talk to people like shit.

 I bought the game when it very first released on steam and periodically check in to see if anythings improved, while the devs have gone leaps and bounds above what the pre alpha was the gameplay is still tedious (if that's your thing there's no judgement) and I say this as someone who has put a lot of hours in other tactical shooters, i'm not just a cod/bf player (check my profile if you don't believe me) 

I put off writing a negative review since 2017 because I always told myself that it's just me not enjoying the game, but it clicked today that the game is just not enjoyable, the mechanics can be confusing and difficult to learn, the community is a solid 'Meh' and unless you're willing to put so many hours in that it becomes a 2nd job you will almost always be bored because the majority of the game becomes a running simulator with subpar gunplay, bad comms and confusion (and not in the immersive 'war is hell' way)

While most complaints are focused on 'shot by someone I didn't see' I don't have that problem, my issue is I see them but it takes 3 working days to aim down my optics even with full stamina and by that point somehow they either hip fire and hit me or are somehow faster (?) it's an unrealistic part of the game that was done to seem more 'realistic' I'm no expert but I've spent a large portion of my life around firearms and I can say with a lot of confidence that even the most average of soldiers can aim down their sight and take aimed shots faster than in Squad.

this brings up my final point - the game can't decide if it wants to be realistic or not. Tanks take multiple ATGMs to go down as do all the vehicles in the game, so the anti tank class is pointless simply because of the ammunition carried being heavily limited to a couple or sometimes even only a single shot. I think that example really sums up the point, infantry are heavily limited in their AT capacity for the sake of realism but vehicles are glorified rocket sponges for some obscure reason.

I would suggest if you are a fan of tactical shooters, to give it a go, maybe it's your thing, but honestly there's too much contrast between realism and arcade to me that the balance just feels wrong and hard to play."
"Literally cannot play the game half the time due to failing to connect, servers not showing and everytime I go to close the game, it crashes instead.... Every. Single. Time."
crashes to much
"Worst game ive ever played, Hands down."
As of recently you cant even get passed the loading screen the game is broke and the devs dont play it so they dont know
"Not as boring as Arma 3, but still not entertaining."
the player's are kinda suck ngl people are just rude af and dont take criticism
Game is starting to crash more frequently
"I love this game but I can't recommend it because of its extremely bad optimization, even at the lowest settings, it sometimes randomly drops to 5 fps, while running at 144+ during others.

Performance issues have been known for a very long time but the devs don't seem to care that much about it."
"runs like crap, looks like crap. retardedly unrealistic weapon mechanics. more time spend listen to inbreeds on the back of a transport swapping dad jokes. Utterly boring and a game I wish I'd got refunded."
"99% of Squad is searching for the 1% in which you'll have some of the most fun you can have on a video game. Also feels very similar to other titles on Unreal Engine (Leaning, FPS Gun Play, Driving) and not in a nice way. Biggest Issue though would be others abusing voting, such as bad maps, layers and or factions."
communist reddit-tier server admins that are unemployed ruin the experience

very fun game"
"barely even got to get into it, specs say it should run great and yet i have to sit through a like 2-3 minute long trailer EVERY TIME I OPEN THE GAME, and recently i cant even play it. I sit through one of the dumbest dev decisions of all time ( a trailer for the game you ALREADY bought and are ACTIVELY trying to play), then i sit blackscreen for 1:11:29 ( the longest i let it load ) and it still doesn't work. Great game."
Always Crashed
performance gets worse every update and its going to UE5 cant wait for it to be unplayable
"I feel like I spend more time finding servers, sitting in the queue for said server and then finding a squad that i'm not kicked from immediately (or at the beginning of the game?) for no reason so I have to join a 3 man squad with no cohesion instead, then actually playing the game."
"Put a lot of time into this walking simulator but i'm gonna be honest, until they fix performance issues, i'm not recommending this game anymore. I'm tired of convincing people to buy this 5 year old game and they can't even run it past 20-25 fps. Performance should have been at the top of the list from the beginning but they haven't done much of anything to fix it."
"shit, wtf is happening"
"bad game move 40 feet slowly and your half jerking off, say your a noob? you get kicked form the squad even if your a rifle man, somehow worse than the arma 3 community and thats saying somthing!"
cant get bipod mechanics to work literally impossible to set up in 90% of the decent spots
"This game is just a waiting simulator. You spend a few minutes waiting during the staging phase, then some idiot drives you to battle and you get blown to bits because the aforementioned idiot drove you directly into the firing line of a f ing tank. You die and wait for someone to pick you, you give up because no one picks you up... then you wait more to spawn back in again. Spawn at a hab... get blown to bits this time by artillery... rinse repeat. The amount of waiting in this game is unbearable. More than half of the 100 hours I've played so far has just been me waiting around, either because I die, or waiting for some monkey brained squad leader to make a decision of where we should attack... then you waste more time driving or sprinting to wherever they want their squad to go. Then finally get where your pea brained squad leader wants to go... and now sit here and hold left click to build a bunch of sh** for 15 minutes.

The game is horribly unoptimized which is hard to believe if you consider the game's age... but yep barely able to break 60 fps and constant dips to 40 and below. Even people with higher end machines complain about performance issues.

I will admit the game can be fun at times... but most of the time you will be standing around doing f**k all. For so long at times where I can literally get up and leave for a couple minutes and nothing has happened in that time.

And when you die in this game it's usually from some guy who's miles away and you couldn't even see. Which makes it even more frustrating when you die when you factor in the absurd wait times in between action. Occasionally your team will setup a forward hab, close to the front lines and this will get you back into the action faster.

Overall, it's not a terrible game... but it's not for everyone. Not to mention all the f ing racist morons that infest this game like a plague."
Would not recommend even with an updated Graphics card I'm still getting crappy frames and everytime I aim out of a scope it freezes my game.
dawg idek
How do I lonch a game
"Admins can ban for whatever they want, once you get banned from 2 servers your copy of the game is bricked and you cant play on any servers,


Also no VOIP enemy chat on the offficial vanilla servers which sucks"
fun but 99% of the time youll be running. wild people enjoy this for hours... i get maybe 1-2 games an dive had enough of running and not seeing anyone. call it skill issue. its not fun
meh boring and bad
"Most games no one places spawns and you spend most of the game either waiting for a spawn or running from main. The community is extremely toxic and it drains what ever enjoyment can be found out of the game. The private servers are owned by clans most of which like to stack their team and just slaughter a team of random blue berries who have never played together, I guess its fun for them but for everyone else it feels like a waste of money for a shitty experience. I can see how it would be fun if people worked together and communicated but most of the time that isn't going on either. The experience overall is really hit or miss and most often its a miss."
"After a very conflicting inner debate, I decided to ""Not Recommend"" this game to anyone who is looking to get into team-based military tactical shooter.
This is not to say Squad is a badly made game, but on the contrary, the gunplay, vehicle and tactical designs are very realistic and immersive. However the killer here is the ""community server based PvP"" gameplay.
Populated servers are always full and you'd have to wait through a queue, usually over 2 min. After that, you are often greeted with a page of server house rules and an arrogant and rude squad leader. 1st time or newbie players are treated as literally ""cannon fodders"" in the game because anyone that prevents the sweaty ""hardcore veterans"" from winning is an expendable. Hell, even the some Medics would blame you for dying, in a PvP game!? 
Forget about learning tactical movements and strategies, the winning side is usually the one mounting more cheesy spots and using more cheesy exploits of the game mechanics (search those 1man vs tanks Squad video on YouTube and you'll see), because it is a PvP based game. All the COD and BF players would not like it cuz ""aiming'n gunning"" would get you killed more and constant action isn't the core of the game. On the other hand, new players seeking ""tactical elements"" would also be disappointed cuz nothing guides you into the chaotic and toxic PvP environment.
If the game has a full single-player campaign or a PvE mode that actually helps recruits learn the basic tactics, like it is advertised, then it's a easy ""Recommeded"" review. But until then, I can't suggest it to others seeking to get into this genre, unless you can put up with a rude and toxic group mic and is okay being ordered to stare at a doorway and forget about the whole game."
"The game is so unoptimised and nobody is welcoming in this, You join a game to hear absolute silence from your team and most of the time get kicked out from a squad or squadmates leave to force you as squad leader. If your joining a game that specifically says to communicate then be prepared to talk otherwise it spoils it for everyone."
8.2 Didn't make ICO any better. Even at High Graphics at 1440p looking through scopes everything is pixelated. The Hardcore/Tactical Shooter Genre will never get a game that is cutting edge and will scratch that itch or have developers who are competent.
devs nerfed the gunplay to the point its not very fun.
"Bad gunplay (Vomit inducing kinda bad)
No destructible environment 
Stupid revive mechanic witch makes killing enemies kinda pointless
Only playable if u have people to play with
Bad performance for how the game looks

Has potential to be a good tactical shooter but needs tons of work"
never let your gay friend suggest a game!
it made me reget the game
"This game is trash, it states you can use controller but what they don't say its a combo keyboard and controller I am all good, it freezes on me and I have a Ryzen 9! max RAM! crazy video card! this game is not what they say"
"With the recent changes to combat, the firefight gameplay feels less team-oriented, and teamwork feels like its become almost irrelevant during fights. I understand the effort to address complaints about ""noodle arms,"" but I really enjoyed the game over the past few months since getting back into it. However, this recent combat update is making me want to play less."
"Makes constant updates that do nothing but break mods. And still after this many years the server browser is still hot dog shit and mnay bugs that existed since the games infancy are still around, que bugs out constantly causing you to rejoin the que at the back of the line and then when you join a server you still get stuck on the running man and guess what back to the back of the line"
HONESTLY THE ONLY THING HOLDING THIS GAME BACK IS SPAWNING
"Walking simulator/Time sink. most of your games you will see one or two enemies. most of your deaths and kills will be friendlies as the game doesnt gives indication only after youve moused over them for 5 seconds. Forget to say sorry in all chat? Banned. The game brags about being a fusion between military sim and arcade, which is laughable when its 85% military sim and 15% arcade at best. Hell let loose is a great example of that fusion, its fun and you constantly feel action, wheres squad, unless youve put in 300 hours to know how the chess game ends, youll lose every time and be killed from 300m away by someone with one of the 5 acog scopes per team. Accidently swear on a server? get immediatly banned by a power hungry 14 year old. Honestly save yourself the disappointment and play hell let loose. If i could get my money back i would, i gave it so many chances, but its honestly a waste of time."
bad game i buy it server no working
No matter how many updates these people put out for this game it's always trash compared to something like squad 44 which has way better mechanics The only downside to that game compared to this one is it's net coding I can't believe how stupid these people are when it comes to how you make squads in this game everybody fighting over something or people not doing their job because there's no dedicated roles or squads to that rule like in squad 44 what a shame and how embarrassing I've lost all hope for these people I want to refund so bad
"Was good - but the game recently had an update that made combat more direct with stamina meaning less - making it easier to land shots on targets.
I already was feeling not up to par before the update but enjoyed playing supporting roles but i'm feeling to old and slow to do anything else now.

If you were looking for a slower paced Mil-Sim FPS style game this was it, but if it continues to go this way it really isn't it anymore."
"I played the game a long time ago, before I signed the dotted line. I've since joined, served, done things I hate myself for, got out honorably, visit the VA monthly for blood work, and for the first time in a long time, I thought ""hey, I kind of miss things. Maybe I should check out that old game I played and see if I can find some guys to hang out with."" After all, being around people who don't speak the language can get pretty lonely, and I've heard vets like to play games like these for fun. How bad could it be?

Man, I didn't even get past downloading the game. I tried to join a server, got rerouted to request access through discord. Joined the discord, hopped in a vc, and was immediately told to go kick rocks for not ""following SOP."" I have absolutely no idea what the actual f**k these pre-pubescent nerd herders were talking about, since I had only just joined the discord to ""request access."" LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. I cannot make this shit up. After asking what they meant by ""following SOPs,"" (keep in mind, the last time I heard the word SOP uttered from a human's mouth was when I was requesting mass for my senior officer's refusal to uphold SOPs leading to the death of a friend), I was then blasted by someone with a lisp for (and I fucking quote) ""behavior unbecoming of a wannnabe boot.""

There are phone numbers in my phone that don't work anymore. I don't sleep at night, and my kidney's are failing from adrenal fatigue. I might be one of the few people who own the game that have called out a real 9 line over encrypted satcoms before. I have not been called a boot in years. 1/10, way too realistic, definitely don't recommend. Join the military instead. They'll still treat you like scum, but at least it will be coming from someone who's actually threatening and you can get paid a little bit too. Just kidding, they won't pay you shit, but at least you'll get some action, unlike what this game has to offer. If getting treated like a recruit by a kid who lives with his parents is what you're looking for, this game is for you!"
most boring game ive ever played in my life
"FUCK THIS FUCKING GAME DUMB AS MECHS, CANT TELL APART FOR ENEMYS OR FRIENDLIES. FUCK THE FALL DMG FUCK THE SWIMMING NOT REALISTICK! FUCK THAT FUCKING GAME"
"I really enjoy the concept of milsim which is why I bought this game. Tried hopping into multiple squads. None of the squad leaders were giving instructions on what to do, everyone was doing their own thing separately. I got really annoyed blindly running and getting shot randomly, having no medics nearby to revive me and so refunded the game. Your teammates make or break the game and I was unlucky enough to be in squads with non-cooperative members."
"I was really looking forward to play Squad , but unfortunately my experience was overwhelmingly disappointing.
Here are the key issues of this game which made it frustrating:-
1.Complex And Cluttered HUD: Compared to clean and simplified intuitive interface of Project Reality , Squad's HUD Feels Cluttered and hard to navigate 
2.Toxic Admins and Larpers who think they are some captain or lieutenant: Unfortunately i Rammed into these people most of my time during my squad experience .
3.Lack Of singleplayer and COOP: The absence of singleplayer severely limits the game replay value without any hassle of toxic players 
4.Unrealistic Recoil and Gun Sway:The Recoil pattern and weapon handling looks absurd in this game compared to real life . How TF a lightweight 5.56 M4 feels clanky and heavy in This so called realistic game
5.FPS And Post Processing Issues: I experienced frequent fps drops and post processing issues that further detracted my overall experience

Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed with my experience with Squad . While i appreciate that Offworld tried to make it more realistic by implementing Infantry Combat Overhaul but somehow it made it much worse and it made Squad much more deviated from actual combat and realism."
"The gun play is horrible gun play. Ads feels like im in a rolling barrel. I dont know, I havent played it too much. But im beginning to think this was a waste of money, but we'll see in the future"
Ive seen more realistic tactics used in gmod servers
"Came from Hell Let Loose expecting similar experience. I did not enjoy this game at all. You have to learn what the enemy looks like as there are no immediate indicators of who is friendly and who isn't. You end up TK'ing a lot in the beginning making it a bad first experience. Devs should let new players have better friend and foe visibility, then slowly take that ability away as you gain experience. Sure you lose realism and maybe I could get gud. Nah, I'll just go back to HLL and have a better gameplay experience. The movement is just so clunky, I thought HLL was a running simulator. This game is a walking simulator. Not fun. Sorry."
Great game but servers are a mess. Hard to find games with low latency. Non-DLC game weapons and skins are pretty trash.
"Squad is a labor of love.

What I mean by that, is that no other game that I am aware of comes even close to the level of play-ability, practicality, and unique game play that can be experienced on this game. I have had moments with friends that exceeded excitement beyond any FPS i have ever played, or action/military movie I have ever watched. There is a role, and way to play for everyone out there in this game.

Squads largest folly, and reason you must know before buying is the community. Squad has harbored some wonderful individuals and my friends list has grown because of it. However, in that same vein, i have met some truly abhorrent individuals on this game. Due to the way OWI handles ""Dedicated Servers"", the community has the reigns on the network. This results in a small group of people, including clans, dictate the way the game is played. Some of the best servers available with the lowest ping, are held privately by discord groups and clans. Unfortunately because of this, favoritism, rule abuse, admin abuse, and overall quality of life suffers. Without TRUE Neutral ""Dedicated Servers"" you will always be looking over your shoulder if you make a wrong move, reading endless rule boards on joining a new server, etc. and the community unfortunately has simply accepted that as standard.

Ultimately, even if you aren't an asshat, you will unfortunately run into an abusive admin, it is almost guaranteed at this point in time. Until true dedicated servers that are independent from community control are available on this platform i cant recommend purchasing this game. But if you are looking for a memorable experience, one i have yet to even come close to matching in any other game available in the lords year 2024, get this game now."
"I may give it another go when there aren't so many new players from the sale.
But even the regulars of the community are much more socially maladjusted than Squad44 (which is actually fun).

This is a game for a specific type of person and I am not that kind of person."
Not Fun
game is only fun when you have 30+ people working together. every other time its miserable.
what the diddy
for some reason squad server don't show up and there is no fix for it. tried everything and still couldn't fix it. online game with a non functioning server list system. don't bother and refund if servers are not showing up after trying the fixes. Offworld doesn't want you to play the game.
AFTER AN UPDATE OF 1KB YOU NEED TO PATCH WHOLE FUCKING GAME
ASS
anti-fun
a
"Its a fun game in theory. The community is fairly immature and racist.

Communications are hard to comprehend how to format and only leads to people raging at you if you can't understand the vague guidelines offered.

EDIT:
EXAMPLE::
- ""Hey guys turn up your local chat volume so you can hear the people around you.""

- *turns up volume.*

- *music blasted into my ears such that I am deaf.*

Ya'll wonder why new players don't have a good time in this game??"
"bad gameplay, dying player base"
admin go on power trips
Game just dosent load anymore
"I wanted to like this game, my friends play it and like it........ But i spent 90 minutes in the game and experienced a bug where i couldnt Aim down the sights so i was useless for 15 of those minutes and then Dying didnt even fix it. AND Twice when i re-spawned i was stuck inside a F-ING WALL! My friends said this has never happend to them but TWICE IN MY FIRST 90 MINUTES?!? How is this game Very Positive? Seems completely bug ridden to me."
walking simulator
fuck your damn unskipable intro. dumb as hell. why do  i need an intro video for a game i have hundreds pf hours in
"played the game for YEARS loved it, can't get into game without skipping the uh... video newb intro? ESC doesn't work anymore uninstalled for now"
"not a bad game at all, crashes all the time though"
"TOO MANY PEOPLE MAKING UP RULES AS THEY GO AND RUINING PLAYER EXPERIENCES, PLAY ARMA 3 AND DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. ADMINS ACT LIKE THEY ARE GODS. SUPPORT OPTIONS DONT EVEN RESPOND. PLAYERS USE KICK TOOLS IN ABUSIVE MANOR MAKES GAME UNPLAYABLE."
Would be a good game if it had some kind of single player/campaign/solo mode for people that work for a living and don't want to be subjected to sweaty neckbeard try-hard manbabies on power trips.
"Tentando conseguir um reembolso, mas é difícil pq cada partida leva em média 1:30h e a Steam dificulta o após 2h de uso.

No mais, o jogo não possui servidores suficientes. É quase impossível encontrar um servidor brasileiro com menos de 15 jogadores na fila. Além disso, o jogo é genérico e mal explicado., e não inova em nenhum sentido. Sinceramente, acredito que o Arma 3 possa ser melhor."
game is great. the new aim system made it bad though. its not realistic and its not gamelike
"It's a fantastic game but gets a dislike due to a lack of Linux proton compatibility support - if Cyberpunk2077 and Warthunder have Linux support, why cant squad?"
"I cant say anything about the gamplay of this game, but i am very upset with the fact i cannot even get past the ""agree with our policy"" screen because the screen is way to zoomed in to click ""agree."""
"fix the audio of burning vehicles, its making me go deaf as admin while moving in admin cam ! 
the effects are at 0% and still i hear it"
low fps lol lol
"The combat overhaul RUINED the game. The game was 1000 times more enjoyable and satisfying before the update. Now it just feels like a chore and a pain in the ass to deal with the horrible mechanics, it's virtually unplayable. Not to mention the worsening performance, I don't remember it ever being as bad as it is now. 

It was good while it lasted though."
"(recreated review)

game is still somewhat bad"
"RECENTLY IN GAME I SAW LOT OF TOXIC PEOPLE. TRASH TALKING, TROLLING, TEAM KILLING OVER AND OVER, I CHANGED LOT OF SERVERS BUT LOT OF PLAYERS ARE THE SAME, I'M NOT WITH THIS COMMUNITY ANYMORE."
"Started really nicely few years ago.... but over time, performance went to shit more and more... any now they are planning to upgrade to UE5 (meaning that performance will go to shit even more)... bear in mind that this is now a ""Live Service"" or ""Free to Play"" game which gets upgraded over time.. All they had to do is finish the game with features, optimise it and leave it as it is... and then create a upgraded sequel... this way, you might buy the game now and in a year or two your hardware won't be able to support it anymore because of the ""upgrades""......"
"What was originally a unique and fun game. 

Has been trashed by poor management choices and piledrived into a un optimised shamble.

Forget whatever hardware youre packing, The game simply will run like garbage while the developers are deaf to the community and think shiny = good.

Do not waste your money. Theyre switching to UE5 and are absolutely going to kill this game with blind ignorance. 

Spend your time elsewhere."
"came back after a year, game runs way worse.
shit game."
They ruined infantry with new mechanics and there are many times where you're bullets are hitting off sand bags or debris that are no where near you're gun which end up getting you killed. game turned into running simulator and people intentionally throw matches and there is no punishment and it just wastes the time for everyone else in the match.
stuck on black screen
Game has become insanely toxic. Especially if you use vehicles. Not worth the buy if you're a chill gamer looking to have fun.
i dislike
Game was too realistic: when I got in the commander seat of the tank I was totally useless and did nothing but block the door out of the coffin in my final moments
This game looks like fun. I hope to try it out one day.
fix the mlr bug you cant change seats
"Great game if you like the genre.
Sound compartment is amazing. Graphically good and good is the game play. 
Unfortunately the community is increasingly getting less welcoming and more toxic, insulting other players for no good reasons. Also is missing a proper, useful and quick tool to report abuse or misconduct."
"Do you like scenic vistas? Do you like bumpy Humvee rides? Do you like controlling your rifle with 2 poolsticks attached to jello cubes? Then dang this is your game? 

Do you want a war game that relies on teamwork, strategy, has fun gameplay, ballistics and vehicles? Go play battlefield. Fuck this game over and over and over again."
this game bad!!! very bad!!!!! do not play pls!!!!!!1!!!!!!1!!
Crashes constatnly
"This game is utter trash, no cohesion, running simulator, spawn and die by enemies you can't EVER see. Frustrating as hell. Rather stick to HLL where it is actually fun and not a damn ever lasting uphill battle where you rarely shoot your weapon, and if you do it's mostly blind fire, where you end up getting shot by an unseen enemy from a mile away. Total utter effin' trash."
"I highly recommend this game to people who are reaaaally committed to mil-sim stuff. As in, you wanna join a group\clan, organize time to play together, and coordinate in large groups. Anything less than full cooperation and teamwork, and this game is a nightmare. 
I, too, once naively thought I'd be able to join an unlocked squad in a public server and run around, fight, do my thing. But that's wrong; you're going to play squad leader now, the last twelve disconnected because playing SL sucks major donkey balls. ""Why does it suck major donkey balls?"", you might ask. Well. Squad leaders don't fight, they talk. They don't get rocket launchers, or sniper rifles, or LMG's, or cool gadgets like IED's. Instead they get a special squad leader-only radio channel so they can talk even more. Instead of putting your mind to the tense and competitive issue of pointing your gun at someone who's pointing their gun at you, you'll get to deal with issues like ""where should I place this rally point"", ""where is my squadmate I need to place this rally point"", ""Nobody is communicating"", ""I can't hear, there are six people talking at once"", ""I've got to get the logistics truck someone else abandoned"", ""Ah shit the logistics truck is stuck"", etc etc.
If you're looking for something in this vein, but easier to play solo or with a few homies, I'd recommend Hell Let Loose. It has a lot of similarities, but in my experience it's way less of a pain in the ass."
"Shittest game ive ever played, i mean that"
"huge waste.. the servers are laggy and the game is dead, its a friday afternoon and there are 20 people online, not even enough for an actual match to start. I sadly am uninstalling the game :/ i hoped it would be good but its just so dead and laggy even killing bots isn't fun"
waste of time
"Aiming in the game became a total joke. I'm not expecting to run around like Rambo, but if I have full stamina, a red dot and a guy sat 90 feet laying prone spraying wildly, i shouldn't have my aim shaking like a shitting dog because he managed to get a stray bullet in my postcode. The game has gone through many meta's but now it is literally the scene from Naked Gun 2 rooftop shootout, with some bum rush tactics thrown in."
game is poorly optimized to the point it stutters at the slightest turn of the mouse im on a i7 10th gen with a 2070 running at medium wit 1080p settings and it still stutters this is embarrassing
"great ass game
standing by

9/27/23- game is trash, ruined by the people at owi. you can tell that they have never played the game or never shot a gun. do not buy this game. owi has shown time and time again that they are incapable of releasing a solid update without breaking the game and adding more bugs that will never be fixed. they have shown that they do not care about fixing long time bugs. they have shown that they do not care or listen to the long time players that have 2,3,4 even 7k hours. they only care for money. DO NOT GIVE IT TO THEM.


10/09 first ico patch- game is still boring, i cannot play this game. i do not understand how to play the game now. moving means you cannot shoot, get shot at means you cannot shoot back. its not a fun game no more. changed to let new players have fun. classic squads was a punishing tactical game. the patch aint patch enough. the slow player movement is okay, but the abd gun play with the new suppression and stamina is not okay. it sucks ass. still do not give otw and tencent your money.

10/24/23- this is prolly the last review i will do for a while. After a month of playing the ico, it still sucks. I haven't played a full match of squad in over a week due to lackluster gun fighting, and not being able to kill ♥♥♥♥ due to the trash gunplay. old squad was punishing and tactics was key. The ico main goal was to up the ttk and thats what they have done. No longer are the days of wiping a full logi that turned down the wrong street. This is just my opinion but if you have not bought the game and is currently reading this review, just know and understand I used to love squads and it was the only game i still looked forwards to playing. Now, i think about the state of the game and feel heartbroken. ♥♥♥♥ you owi and and offworld devs. go SAD. call me bad, call me whatever you want. hope this helps and i hope some dev reads this.

If you are looking at my recent hours, understand ALL of the hours I have since 09/27/23 are on the MEE mod which is a mod that slows the game down in various ways without ruining INF game play while also keeping v6 gun mechs.

5/10/24- game is still trash, ico seen little to no tweaks, bug patches are for from being a regular thing and the dev team, dont get me started, from banning players on discord with bad reviews to breaking steams TOS, they are god awful. Only thing to look forward to are mods. Lmao, till next time, this is how my worthless steam review on a game I use to love will sit. ♥♥♥ u OwI jHeTt."
10% of the time it's one of the the most exciting and immersive FPS games around. 90% of the time it's a coin flip on being either an absolute snore fest or you're getting your fudge packed to no end.
wont let me open after 100 hours of play time
"Before the infantry combat update, you played as a trained soldier, cool, smooth and fast. You could aim and hit your targets, a few bullets flying overhead was no biggie and you did your PT in training so you could run 20 feet and still shoot accurately. 

Now after the ICO everyone has noodle arms, your vision is blurred terribly upon taking even just a couple rounds from small arms fly overhead and sprinting for even just a couple seconds drastically reduces your aiming abilities. This went from a semi realistic mil sim shooter to what the nerd game devs think a real firefight must be like. Having shot real guns, and had real training through swat the ICO did not all deliver the realistic infantry mechanics you come to a game like this for."
"the game is fun and enjoyable but after a recent update, even on the highest possible graphics, there are AA artifacts and some maps have random white objects. im sorry but I can't recommend a game, as much as fun it is, if it doesn't run on my system. And for those wondering I have a 5800X3D 7900XTX, it's not my specs. 

if the devs ever fix this graphics issue, this game will be very fun to play"
Players so toxic
Can't see anything
"Boring, just like arma Sim mod Server, some people (mostly the ones with no jobs) are shouting at you, screaming and flaming the toxic crap out of you for just playing the game. (I wonder why I dont want to communicate with such individuals) when solo mod against bots?"
"if i have to be dead honest the games whole entire gameplay is stale. it's literally an endless walking simulator until you get shot out of completely fucking out of nowhere by a tank shell or a sniper who does it for a living. its boring, rather recommend insurgency sandstorm for a better tactical gameplay (being for real dont even think about buying this game)

EDIT: its also an unoptimized piece of shit game. today i went to a hardware store to replace my ryzen 5 2600 with a ryzen 5 5600x and it made about 10-15 fps diff. game is literally made by lazy developers"
jhklkj
"ICO made infantry combat extremely boring and doesn't improve teamwork in any shape, way, or form. Couldn't recommend"
"Recently Re-installed Squad, its a Fun game, when it works. Currently plagued with a EAC error that seems to have no fix and with many others having the same issue over the last week and no fix yet. Really makes you think the devs are far more worried about emotes and gun skins rather than a functioning game. Garbage, and i wish i could get my money back at this point."
.
i open the game and watch the start of the game then it wont load any menus
hi pls optimize
why the FUCK does it take so long to load into a basic match and actually fuckin' PLAY?
"This game, hands down, has the worst shooting mechanics of any FPS game I've ever played. I don't know why the devs think that ""Realism"" means that you cant even hold your weapon even partially steady, or that you cant run more than 20 feet without getting winded as a trained soldier. The game  used to be fun until they changed the infantry game play, and the overall game play besides the shooting mechanics is awesome, but now it's so incredibly frustrating to play that it's not even worth the hassle. Do not recommend."
"step 1-install game
step 2-open game
step 3-join server
step 4-they want you to install mods
step 5-spawned in
step 6-didn't know anything around me
step 7-exit game
step 8-uninstall game
step 9-kms with a pistol"
I have a 1660s and 5600g 32gb ram. I exceed the requirements but im only getting around 40 to 50 fps
"Community is toxic and full of very stupid people for admins. Couple of short examples:
1. Play vehicle, friend crashes, driving vehicle back to main solo. Admin tells me to leave the vehicle or get kicked, I comply. Friend rejoins, we head back to the vehicle. I get kicked for leaving the vehicle in the middle of nowhere as told. :D
2. Our tank is hit, I jump out to repair tracks, admin tells my friend to ""stop soloing vehicle or get kicked"" he jumps out.. We both get killed while outside. Soon, as the SL I get kicked for ""wasting assets"". :D
F This game. F those people."
"Poorly optimized, meh UI, weapon handling & Graphics is pretty dated (That 2005 idea of what realism is supposed to be). At the price point id expect something MUCH better. At best this is a 14.99 game."
do not play it
GAME BAD IT CRASHT 2 TIMES IN ROLE DO NOT GET THE GAME
not my thing
"I still cant log in to any server cause the error of steam not connected 
and i cant play the game"
terrible game. was great till ICO. ruined it. :( play project reality!
"If you thought this game was in any way realistic or tactical it's not. It's an arcade where you pick a pre-built load out from a UI menu that's a pain in the ass to navigate, no customization or even a variety in choice whatsoever. Walking simulator because there's no free access to vehicles, all vehicles are private to each individual squad so you physically can't join with any friendlies and jump into battle, or escape from battle by retreating to a friendly vehicle. Also can't join any squads because all squads are locked in at just one or two people, while the five squads that are actually open to the public are always full. And you're not allowed to make your own squad if there's unfilled squads, ie. the squads that can't be joined because they're locked in at just one person. Then because you're not joining any squads (because you're not allowed to) you get kicked from the game. The name of the game is SQUAD and no one wants to SQUAD and then YOU get KICKED for not SQUADING... FUN, RIGHT?!

So what happens if you actually do snatch a free seat in a rarely open squad and actually get into the fight for once and finally play the game? You get head-clicked by someone literally 500+ meters away who's not even within render distance, which means no one else can see them or return fire as they stand around clueless and get downed too! FUN! So then who picks you up? Nobody, no one picks up anyone or repairs vehicles or helps anyone, you just die and lose respawn tickets and then lose the match after running out of tickets, simple. Part of that is due to BUGS and GLITCHES where you CAN'T USE BANDAGES/AID KITS for some reason, but most of the time people are just selfish glory hunters getting to the top of the scoreboard for most kills to actually bother helping the team. 

In other words it's Call Of Duty without any of the freedom of choice, with servers that don't want you to squad up and play the game in the first place. If you want a fun military arcade to compete for score play COD, if you wanna play an actual military sim with realism and be a team then play Arma 3, this is just a horrible mashup between the two without any of the fun, freedom, or cooperation."
"This comment is focused on Helicopters 

I love the game i just wish the creators mentioned for heli pilots you need about 32gb of ram 16 gb is not going to do it for you i have 16gb DDR 5 Ram and my game lags extremely bad when i pilot and most of my 174,5 hours is heli pilot 

Then the other concerning topic is the amount of bugs yes the game is very good for the times its been up but really update after update after hotfix the creators refuse to fix the selection wheel when in a vehicle sometimes when i want to drop supplies oh look my game wont let me out of the selection wheel and boom crashed my heli because i cant control it or the recent update where helicopters perform better in training range then in real battle in traning range you can barrel roll any heli and do any tricks but in a real server your heli stalls out or overturns more then in the training range aswell as using guns on any heli makes the required ram from 32 gb to 128 gb it is so lagy for no reason i do love this game but unfortuantly it has to much vehicle bugs"
run for 1 hour die instantly
"very klunky game play ,very toxic community , i have encountered tons of  rude players and only one person who was willing to help a new player"
fkn shit game wont load and crash and cost 50dollars
Cant skip the intro cut scenes
"Out of all thing that pissis me off about this game is that I have to fuking deal with noodle arms

Whats with the exaggerated recoil it's annoying"
"This game opted out of family sharing, which is cringe.

Do not allow publishers to claim purchasing is not owning, sharing amongst your games like discs among family should be encouraged not dissuaded."
Once again another game that i was told to get and to play with buddies that never get on. finally decided to figure it all out on my own and got everything optimized for my pc and now the game refuses to launch ever since i restarted my pc.
totarsch
Trying to configure anything is like pulling teeth.
You still can't form a pre-game party in a game called SQUAD
.
too complicated for my little brain
Running Sim
Great concept but matches are often super unbalanced making the experience lame.
"I keep trying to come back to this game a few months at a time. I dont understand how people can enjoy this game especially since you cant join a single server ""an anti cheat integrity check failed"". I unfortunately wasted my money on this overly praised piece of trash"
"This game was fantastic until the somewhat recent combat overhaul. The weapon stability system physically makes no sense. It feels like your character has no shoulders as your weapon sways from side to side like a piece of fabric when you turn... This combined with the goofy CoD levels of recoil for EVERY caliber, especially 9mm and 5.56, which irl can be full auto mag dumped with almost zero barrel incline. Make this game feel like some sweaty nerds fever dream about what real combat looks like after he tried to shoot a heavy gun at a range once.... This game used to feel tactical and fun as hell, but now instead of feeling like a soldier I feel like some 300 lbs McDonald's going basement dweller larping as a soldier.... No one asked for that gaming experience.................................."
"EAC easy anticheat does not work or run, cannot join any servers or play because of this issue. No solution. SMH"
"""an anti cheat integrity check failed""

So fun!"
"At some point in squad you wont be able to join a server because ""Anti cheat check failed"" will appear and you wont be able to fix it since any tutorial is 100000 years old"
I love the part where I Launch the game and get a update every time I do so. Can't even play when I want to have multiple 20 gb plus updates after launching

Used to be so fun. Can't recommend it anymore, ever since they changed the gun handling."
"Spawn > walk 45 minutes across map > die > repeat

Impossible to aim or hit anything, every animation and action is sluggish and unresponsive like reloading or walking or looking, press click to shoot... doesn't shoot, press click 10 more times... it shoots, weapon sway all over screen, get booted out of a squad and given 1 magazine useless loadout and be stuck in the middle of nowhere, 2 hours and I swear I haven't seen a single enemy, get shot from behind a bush half a mile away, Weird acceleration looking and walking, pixel hunter/walking simulator."
walking simulator
"Buggy as hell. Crashing and freezing mid game, resizing on its own, inaccurate menu cursors, etc."
server problems and high latency on my region.
"ill be honest, the ICO update ruined the game. it feels like youre a 10 year old kid whos never once held a firearm when you get into combat, and oh yeah, when you run 100 yds as a SOLDIER, your stamina bar is empty and you cant shoot for shit, which mind you, as someone who does this kind of thing for a living, and has to regularly train while shooting and moving, and after running, is not how it works.  The supression mechanic in this game is also horrendous, you dont just lose the ability to see when you get shot at, if anything the adrenaline improves your vision and aim, in the game you basically become blind for 10-20 seconds, its just not accurate, and feels like someone thats never been in that scenario designed that aspect of the game. This game tries so hard to be realistic, while somehow overdoing it, all the while the performance is dogsh*t, how does a game that looks like it was made in 2015 get 65 fps on a modern pc with a 4070.  Its just trying to do too much, while simultaneously not being accurate to real life while claiming to be realistic.  They just got bought out by the chinese as well, so if you dont like that, dont buy it.  I wouldnt recommend it, and i certainly wouldnt buy it if i didnt already own it, it was so much better before the micro transactions, and ICO update. Steer clear if you actually like realistic games, play arma or HLL, this game feels extremely dated for what it is, while also missing the modern realistic aspects that are in every other modern ""sim"" shooter.  Theres like 1k consistent players, where before the ICO update there was probably 4-5k, its not bad, it just feels like theyre trying so hard to be ""realistic"" but also having no concept of actual ""realism""."
"DO NOT BUY! Devs ruined the game when they overhauled the infantry combat system... Roll back to when you could actually aim at the enemy! I've had situations where me and an enemy see each other, and can't kill each other because your gun is waving around all over the place like you're drunk af! Not even close to realistic anymore."

"Genuinely trash, save your money and just punch yourself in the face, it'll be more fun"
this game needs optimization
"The Star Wars mods are the selling point here for me. Gameplay, mechanics, customization, graphics, animations, literally everything feels at least slightly worse than the other large scale shooters and milsims. Large playerbase but not enough active servers, gotta wait 10+ minutes sometimes."
buy squad 44
"SUGA A SUA VIDA, FOQUEM NO FUTURO!"
"The game never finds a server, I can find servers while browsing outside of the game or steam (in the game it never loads any lists), unable to connect to anything no matter what I try to do, too bad I am way past the point of claiming a refund."
"Good but game is so slow
Like for every weapon draw,every time you need to get in and out of the vehicle consume so much time..Going prone and crouch also takes so much time
Game is slow,very slow
But good"
"use to be a great game now pile of hot garb, use to be everyone on same playing field. Fun exciting matches turn into i am blind, my gun is swaying everywhere, i have to lay down every 10 seconds to gather stam to line up dots... whatttttt 

took break for 10 months come back only to support as Medic but its more frustrating than anything else, Foxhole is better, Arma reforger is better
 
great game turned into a mess"
Arma reforger is better
"Game is a potential lawsuit, computers can't run this game with the recommended specs. They are just taking peoples money hope they get a lawsuit because they deserve it. Game runs poorly. Don't buy!"
crashes... a lot
"Game's good, but terrible optimization and it feels like for the past 4 years they did not do anything to fix the jarring problem."
"Boring, just boring. I like MILSIM but this game is not for me at all."
"This game is terrible when it comes to performance. My build can handle any game at 2K; for example, in BF2042 with 128 players, I get 170-200 FPS on ultra settings with DLSS Quality. However, in this game, which doesn't look that good graphically, I only get around 60-80 FPS on some maps, and on the optimized ones, I get about 100-150 FPS. Yet, it drops to 60-80 FPS in crowded areas. The experience as a war sim is fun, but the performance makes it unplayable compared to other FPS games on the market."
"bought this game played it a month enjoyed it alot but since aprils update cant even load into the menu but this last attempt i got 10 minute commercial for squad a game i already own which you cant cancel the video, than after everything It ends ands im black screen loading and don't even get a menu... what is wrong with this game you cant even load into it to attempt to give a shit."
.
ptsd acquired
Admin abuse has made this game unenjoyable.
"I have yet to be convinced that this game is actually fun. Will play a few more rounds with my friends but at this time its just been a series of listening to shouting matches and admin kicking people on the opposite (my) team for doing well.

Edit: Yeah this game fuckin sucks man why do people find this fun. I spend 3 hours running around and getting shot from places I cant see. I get it, massive skill issue, but fuck this is boring as hell."
"ICO has ruined what used to be one my favorite games, OWI has gone to shit since the original team left and are apparently staffed by people who have no concept of what squad was meant to be.

I'd refund it if I could since they've completely changed the product I paid for into something else entirely."
"Feels different, people are a lot more angry than they used to be. Not fun imo."
"I guess it's not my cup of tea. the game is supposed to be a realistic shooter, but the gunplay is to a point that it makes the game unrealistic and pretty unplayable at times. I looked into it and saw that a lot of the community feels the same. It might be a learning curve or something, but me personally, I don't think so. I think it's just bad gunplay mechanics."
turn
The gun mechanics are terrible walk for 5 seconds and then your character doesn't even know how to hold a gun anymore the second you stop walking or you jog for three seconds your character can't hold his gun straight for like 20 minutes
Read all the negative reviews on this chinese spywareUwU good gun mechanicz tho
"Any time I boot this game up I am reminded that its maps are so barren and unpopulated it's hard to fathom how anyone actually lived there, this in itself wouldnt be so bad but along with its unrealistic gunplay, game breaking bugs, and hit or miss squad leaders the game lends itself to being more frustrating than fun 80% of the time, when it does work for that 20% I often find myself asking why Im playing this vs Tarkov, Battlefield, or any other shooter that has some semblance of progression or self improvement. Oh also lets not forget they went back on their Kickstarter promises of no paid DLC, if they had made a way to earn those cosmetics as well as buy them I dont think it would be as big of an issue but the only way to get them (at the time of writing) is slapping down your hard earned dollery doos for half baked (and sometimes not functional) cosmetics that cost more than a copy of Vampire Survivors."
This is by far the worst game I ever tried.
Actions are too clunky and unresponsive.
"Weapon mechanics are too slow and clunky, recoil is horrible, ads is just weird, moving while ads is dumb. I dont understand why games get ads with weapons in game so wrong for example, using an LMG with bipod you dont bring the weapon in to aim you move your head onto the weapon. Same thing with assault rifles, when you know your about to get contact the weapon should already be in the low ready position so its just straight up and down in and out of the scope, not like in this where it shifts the weapon so far from right to left then still shaking about all over the place.

HOLY SHIT the weapon mechanics are bad in this game!"
"I love this game, but I cant recommend it to most of you. This game is based off of squad tactics and communication, each role and vehicle takes time to learn and master, and the game really shines when you have a competent team that knows their roles. Win or loss, the game is a blast when the pieces fit. However, multiple sales and free weekends later, about 80% of the players you will run across are window lickers that cant do anything but W Shift. 

The game is now plagued with SLs that dont SL, and the average blueberry is completely unreliable. Squad tactics? Nope. Communication? Whats that? Heli? I flew in Battlefield so I can take the Heli right? This is a game that demands that you use your brain, it demands that you share information and take the information shared with you to make a tactical decision for your squad and your team. And right now that just aint it. OWI recently gave us a new voting system, and the game has subsequently been destroyed because of it. Too many people dont think about their vote, they see the faction they want to roleplay as and scream to vote that faction, and then you end up with an atrocious game like British Logistics vs PLA Tank Battalion on Sanxian. (Brits have no amphibious vehicles btw, so island map is a bad pick for them lmao.)

In short, if you find yourself interested in this game, research it. And come in prepared to learn. Tell your SL you are new, if they are competent they will help you learn the game. Bind your map key to a mouse button too, you should basically live in your map. And for the love of God please use your brain. Please."
"Game is functionally unplayable.

OWI issues strict rules to server owners on what they can and can't do, but every sever is filled with loser admins who will TK for fun, but hand out bans readily for anyone they don't like. OWI lost control of the power tripping incels 'server owners'.

Until there are fundamental changes in how servers are operated, this game isn't worth your money."
"Absolute joke of a game. Servers are all run by power tripping incels. This game had so much potential but was ruined due to poor server admins. Terms of Service is a joke. Rules are only there to selectivly ban people. Server admin are a joke, WHAT A WASTE."
i once played this game everyday but now this newest infinity update completely ruined my mood to ever come back to the game but i mean some ppl like it but for me and many others is sucks that we have to put this game down and find other games
"Squad could've been amazing. This game got so close to being a true spiritual successor to Project Reality. Don't get me wrong, the game looks amazing, but the feel will never compare to Project Reality. If OWI keeps going down this trend of copy paste re-skin faction updates, the game will stray away from the original vision and get stale and boring. Waited for 6+ years to get attack helicopters and they FINALLY give us one, but only for the PMC faction, and with a very small payload. The PMC faction and the Turkish faction are almost identical for most of their vehicles. Both factions models are a majority of models that are already in the game. There is still so many great aspects of PR that Squad has yet to capture, CAS is by far one of the biggest, thermals for armor, better mod support, and the insurgency gamemode?? It's in the game but nothing like it was in PR and the lack of civilian kit makes it feel so boring. If you used to play PR and you're looking for something that can compare, Squad is not it. They almost had it right, and I like to hope that maybe they will, but recently my hope is fading faster and faster by the day."
"...na. Does not feel good to shoot in this game. no idea when you get a kill. ""realism"" sometimes just kills all the fun."
"certain roles are only available to squads of a certain size

every squad in the game is ran by a neckbeard who will kick you for not roleplaying the way they want

you cannot play most of the game because of this"
"Get rid of the new intro, shit is annoying, guys voice is annoying, wayyy too loud. Why can't I turn this shit off? Let me game in peace ffs."
"Admins ruin this game. Most anti fun cucks I have ever encountered in any multiplayer game, fuck your rules"
the new recoil/stamina system makes the game unplayable
"Trash game. Basically youre forced to play how someone else tells you to play, regardless of how you like to play..

Do you like to use a particular style weapon? Too bad. 
Do you like to do drive tanks? Too bad.
Do you like to fly drones? Too bad.

Unless some random person allows you to play YOUR game the way YOU want to, you are not allowed.. What a shitty system.

Dont buy this game"
this game is soo buggy and shit you can't even find servers and ask for help on discord no help at all just to bad unlucky
HIDE YOUR KIDS
This game was better before OWI decided every gun should feel like a 4 year old is shooting it.
"Lots of bugs, suck performance, fps drop and lagging while contact. AT LEAST 1 YEAR already. If you tell me rtx2080+9700k+32gb ram with medium high setting is not enough... man... what can I say... Maybe the devs should go back to high school to restudy 'What is Programming and Debug'."
"I've played too many fps games and the only thing good about this one is the beginning of the round when everyone is on the mics.

UI is ATROCIOUS.

Mil sim = you play dead most of the round munching on snacks; not actually playing a fps in any way.

Game is so slow that it's too late to return it by the time you play 2 games.

There is no arcade aspect to this game whatsoever.

Not worth $50 even if i enjoyed it.

Play any other fps game and enjoy your playtime."
"Every single aspect that made squad squad has been destroyed by the ICO. I was willing to try and give the new mechanics a fair shake, but the utter and incomprehensible level of incompetence by the devs is too much now to ignore. Every single step of the way since ICO they have been taking options away from players, from infantry combat to TOW function. Wanna actually guide a TOW? Nah, we're gonna make the smoke plume so huge you can't even see the trajectory for the first 500m of flight time. 

And I would be willing to forgive all of this, if it wasn't for the blatant hypocrisy at OWI. They know their ICO weapon sway is garbage, they know because the m14 is way easier to handle than every other battle rifle, but they released it with weapon sway turned down and with reduced recoil because they wanted people to like their new faction (which wasn't needed in any way) meanwhile the g3 and FAL sway/recoil like my character is an actual child. No one picks MEA, Turks, or Brits because they are objectively worse factions. OWI absolutely know this, but they are so up their own ego they can't begin to even consider the possibility they may have been wrong. The fact that it requires mods to give these factions 5.56 or similar calibre weapons is an utter disgrace to the devs. 

The ICO didn't ""change the gameplay to be more teamwork based"" it just made it worse because everyone knows most goobers who only play squad as a battlefield alternative don't care about ""working with the squad"" or ""using vehicles as mech infantry"" all they want to do is shift W to the next cap to get into another gunfight that they lose. 

OWI had the most loyal fanbase in almost all of modern PC gaming and they spat on them. They had better hope no competitor pops up in the near future, because if it does, Squad will very quickly find itself a dead game."
"According to the Community Ban List, I am listed as the 5th most toxic/harmful player in the entire game. I would like to preface what I say by just saying that any accusation that I am the 5th most toxic player in the entire game is categorically, unequivocally and resolutely untrue, for I contend strongly that I am in sooth the most toxic player in the game.

Resultingly, I request that the game, or whoever runs the Community Ban List for this game rectify their mistake and make me number 1, as opposed to 5. It is absolutely insulting that anyone could even remotely hint at me being a paltry 5th, BAH, it's a disgrace! I will make my review positive when this clerical and game changing error has been altered. Regards, Ned Kelly."
unoptimised piece of shit
"Would be a brilliant game, but the community are so toxic. Each server I played on had rampant racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. In a game that requires you to have a mic and listen to the other players, this made the game unplayable."
"No sex update, bad game"
Servers not loading
intro should be loud and unskippable
TRASH GAME STUCK ON CINEMATIC
"FROM YOUR AD BULLSHIT, WE ALREADY BOUGHT THE GAME WE DONT NEED SEE DAM AD FOR IT IN THE GAME"
WALKING/YAPPER sim w poorly optimized PiP features and really bad shooting mechanics. Optimization has gone steadily downhill for a few years. Armor is fun if you can get it but sometimes your tank will be unable to drive up a hill.
"walking simulator, need small maps"
No achievements
"Squad used to be my all time favorite game to play. Every day I would come home and play at least two hours of Squad. It had everything. Large maps, 120+ player lobbies, helicopters and tanks, getting in firefights with enemies on a mountain top a kilometer away. I was instantly hooked and loved every second. Then around my 680 hour mark, ICO was released and completely ruined the game play experience for me. Before ICO, you were able to quickly return fire when fired upon at close range and be able to hit your target as long as your reticle or iron sights were on their body. With ICO there is now a ""suppression"" mechanic that blurs your screen when shot at as well as making your arms very shaky, making it extremely difficult to aim. ICO has made it so that whoever shoots first wins almost every time. It's very unfortunate because this game really used to be great. RIP True Squad"
yeah no this game sucks lmao
"It would be cool to be able to play the game you know without constant freezing.

5800x
32gb DDR4 3200
4070 12gb"
Awfully optimised...
Needing to do a NAT hairpin/loopback to be able to join a server running on the same machine is stoopid
"this game is just bad, 6 hours later it is still bad.

My buddy tyler HATES it too"
what did they do to this game
unoptimized mess
ICO ruined this game
"Absolutely garbage game the worst optimization ive ever seen i have a 4080 super and a ryzen 9 7950x and i barely get 110fps.
I've had the game since 2018 its just progressively gotten worse!!
They also slowed down the game sooo much theres nothing positive about it i used to look past the horrible performance but now its an all around 1/10 game."
"eat early access dogshit for $50

the game is literal dogshit when it comes to gameplay, can't use your laser or a flashlight even if you have one, lags very badly with only 40 max even with my 3080, poor made scope modification system, missing lots of animation like entering a vehicle or switching seats despite this game claiming to be so immersive, this game has nothing special than just graphics and lighting.
imagine all of your ammo disappears at the middle of the battle because some guy kicked you from your squad"
"Ever since the overhaul the game has been shit. Players are all spineless when it comes to teaching the game to new players and the community has been ruined. Unless they revert the game back to the way it was, I will never touch this game again."
fix noodle arms
"Played this game for the first time in like 2 years and WTF. The movement is so slow and clunky now, feels like im on the surface of the moon. If you remember a time when the game felt responsive and had an intuitive UI, just know those days are long long gone. Dont waste your time."
"Game has become a 2 min advertisement for itself followed by a blank screen. Windows volume mixer cannot silence it. Only master volume can turn it off. 0/10 stars, chinese bloatware.

If and when it ever works it's a pretty unique game."
"TRIED ARMA? Thought squad would be a little easier? Think again, it is a running/dying simulator."
"This game is a piece of shit fcking parkinsons simulator delayed microphone like im in 90s sitcom up in this bitch just because the game is a milsim doesn't make it good, my microphone on 3 headsets doesn't work, ohhh and thanks for the microtrasactions.
You had it YOU FCKIN HAD IT IN THE BAG but noooooooo let's ruin this like with squad 44 imma go back to project reality and operation flashpoint choke on a dick"
"Shooting feels like you have wet noodles for arms, my grandma can hold steadier aim"
"join games where nobody speaks english because if not you have to wait 20 minutes or more for a basic server. Then nobody tells you about the horrible infantry update where you hold the weapons like a toddler, toxic community of team killing, random admin kicking, the horrible communication, then walking for 15 minutes and then getting one tapped by some random dude in a bush or 200m away that has been staring in the same spot for 1 hour. I even bought a nicer headset to enjoy the communication, waste of money, waste of time. Just as bad as tarkov."
"The old squad was a blast, this new version is utter trash if you play infantry.

The gunplay is abysmal. It's as if both of your arms are broken initially for 10 seconds after you ADS. Yet if you wait long enough you can shoot as accurate as a benchrest shooter but you are actually standing firing offhand. It boggles the mind how bad this system is. In short if you move you die, if you just sit around you can snipe people like it's nothing. Oh and almost every type of damage you receive causes fatal bleeding unless you bandage yourself. So your whole body is one big artery. And don't get me started on the clunky animations. I've seen better and faster weapon handling from first time shooters than the soldiers you play as. There's no animation blending whatsoever."
you go in to ply and everything is blurry as shit a person two meaters in front of you is a blob and anyone across road is just a blurr
how are you going to have a mill sim game and kick people for saying shit in chat are you 12 bunch of pussies running the servers
"The game is not good for three main reasons
1. Bad community
There is lot of noobs and call of duty headless chicken players that just play the game for the dopamine of getting kills, the game is not as tactical and cooperative as the trailer shows.
2. Bad administration
The moderators will ban you for stupid reasons, the rules of their servers are ambiguous and they ban people FOREVER for the most stupid reasons. While they dont ban players that dont comunicate or waste tickets.
3. Bad mechanics
This is the least important point, the game is programmed well, and the mechanics are not really very bad. But it just dont seem to encourage/force people enough into cooperating and playing using their head instead of as stated earlier searching the dopamine of killing.

Honestly, dont buy this game, is not worth it."
"A menu within a menu within a window, within poorly constructed menus and controls. It's perhaps not as bad as ARMA, but the few hours I did play 99% of the time, I was lost in settings and bugs.

Bugs (shorter list) - I had issues using a controller; it says ""mostly playable"" on the store page but in reality it has absolutely zero controller support neither on foot or in menus. Another bug I had was trying to get the game to accept sending audio to my headset - resulting me in to having to close and reopen the game a few times.

Settings - the UI with interacting with things, general control settings seem very wonky and convoluted.

Controls - Almost as bad as ARMA. For some reason they decided to turn something as simple as entering a vehicle into a 3-step process where you can enter after holding interaction down for 5 seconds, or tinker with supplies on something like a truck, to auto entering the driver seat while tinkering with supplies. Then when you are in the truck - you have to hit a separate magical button to start the engine (I couldn't get it to work on the keyboard, but I could start an engine via a controller layout I found). For a lot of the time, I would use a controller layout until I had to use keyboard, and when using keyboard and something very stupidly simple like ""crouch"" or starting an engine - I had to go back to the controller because it was simpler.

I cannot understand why you can't just go to prone (Z), to standing upright. In the tutorial even, I could go from prone to crouch just fine but standing was .... like finding a gold brick in your behind, under a foot, while hand standing on a chair. If you are in prone and jump - it'll let you stand but you'll also go from prone to literally a hop in the air before you were standing.

Other than these issues... The game ran good, the walking and running motions were amazing. The firing of any weapon were amongst the best in FPS gaming. Even throwing objects like grenades were feeling really good. The slow and deliberate aiming of the weapons and other gun-play were superb. It could really be a game changer if they simply worked on the controls and UI to a more friendly level."
"fucking piece of shit walking simulator why would you play this shit ass game in your free time shit takes 30 minutes of walking to get into some action and if you sue a car you just blow up instantly once u get there absolute fucking bullshit game teammates keep killing me bruh fucking shit game. 30 year old towering pile of fat father figure calls an airstrike on our team and then yells at us for ""wasting"" 5 tickets even though we have a fucking 1000 left. When im popping off and killing everyone they kick me from the server for ""racism"" and toxicity or some bullshit absolutely fucking unacceptable"
"ICO is fucking stupid, average combat experience is being a trained soldier running 10 meters then shaking like an alzheimer's patient when you try to ADS"
Not enough shooting of minorities/
please revert ico update
"Just die and die and die, get shot from every direction and can't ever see who's shooting you or tell which side anyone is on.  This game sucks."
L game
"Was looking for a serious tactical shooter and then you add people, then tactics are gone out the window."
"You need to fix ICO scope issue, when u ADS game looks like minecraft, FPS drops, especially when there is heavy combat. U implemented ICO and with that u just worsen the game experience cuz now FPS is big problem, u need to fix first these technical problems before implementing some new stuff to the game. If i need NASA pc to play this game at 60fps 1080p then its a problem at ur end. Even Tarkov dont lag like this game. I like this game but its unplayable because of FPS drops, ADS minecraft scopes, and I think u should consider reworking gun sounds, but first PLEASE fix FPS drops, then PLEASE fix these scopes. Thanks"
"I have enjoyed this game for a long time. 

Once the new shooting mechanics (ICO) came in I had to leave, it was such a massive change I couldn’t accept it. 

I went away with the idea of coming back in a few months to a year and hopefully the system would have matured and balanced. By this time I would have forgot my muscle memory of how the game handled as well. 

I have played a few games in the last few days and I can whole hardily say the  game is dead to me now. 

Every aspect of this game is a 10/10 except the shooting. THIS IS NOT HOW SHOOTING AND FIGHTING WITH A GUN FEELS!!!. 

The shooting system reminds me of an old Xbox game called “Full Spectrum Warrior” where you required to suppress a position and use flanking, but even with a flank when you guys engaged you entered some sort of hit percentage probability. Great for that game and what it was trying to create but it does not work for a modern day, semi mil sim game like this. 

I have zero understanding on the player bases acceptance of this mechanic and why it hasn’t died. 

Here is to the future of tactical shooters and hopefully something comes that fills the hole left by this games changes.

8.2 points: Better gun play but still a good way to go. Binoculars should have a stability issue, nor should anti tank weapons. Pistols needs further improved along with iron sighted/red dot equipped rifles. My review is still accurate."
it is getting boring very quiqly
"Indeed this game requires microphone to play it BUT before that, basic motor skills, least amount of intellect and knowing moderate level russian is verry crucial for this game, if you don't have at least one of them don't play it. 0-1 ticket loosing/10 israil and hamas as factions and concert venue + gaza hospital as maps would be awesome ( of course with civilians and childs )"
it bad
downloaded the game and cant play it because its stuck on some black screen. worst money ive spent all week dont recommend
"This game used to be amazing with so many fun moments. Since OWI's last marketing push, the health of the community has suffered greatly. Servers are now filled with those who do not even want to begin to try to coordinate with others. Many I suspect do not even have a working microphone. It's being played more like battlefield at this point. There has always been a learning curve with experienced players teaching the new. With this last batch of players, it's not teaching, it's like trying to drive a bus full of special education students who missed their medications this morning. OWI has found their target demographic, and I hope they enjoy it. I just wish somebody would have explained to them that quantity doesn't equal quality."
"I've never done a steam review, but this got me so angry i had to do one and let people know.

squad can be an enjoyable game, playing with teammates and having communications has been quite a different experience from traditional shooter games. despite having 80 hours total i still felt like a new player and still trying to figure out how things work clearly.
its sometimes hard to hear people speak and telling friend from foe is difficult in situations despite with 80 hours in.

but despite the gameplay, do not play this game, because eventually the people in charge won't let you play anymore. despite spending 50$ you'll feel scammed and mistreated, if you try to have fun you'll be unable to play the game. and this game will slowly run out of players.

the real problem lies on its community, there's a bunch of reasons why that is, and why you shouldn't purchase this game.

1) the servers, how servers work is that they're run by the community, specifically clans, the admins throw random bans over the most minimum mistakes, there's a lot of admin abuse, they have ""strict"" rules and you cannot question them, if you do, you get banned, but the rules don't apply to clan members, admins, or patreon users, the mods go on ego trips and ban you over the pettiest things, you will find out that you're being secretly recorded by users, are they doing it for youtube? streaming? no they're doing it to get you banned, what they do is record something, and upload it to their discord to get you banned.
in other words, it's a solid way to ban new players over the pettiest things, you can try to appeal it but either you have to lick their boots to soothe their ego, or an admin will say ""we'll look into it"" and have the ban stay.
this happens in all servers, and it happens to all players. you won't be able to play on servers for months, even permanently, even if you follow all the rules, and do everything as you say, it won't matter because you'll be at fault no matter what. expect to be abused when joining a server, the people are hypocrites.

2) community bans, what this game fails to tell you is that it has its own VAC system,  they use the ""communitybanlist.com/banned"" which should not be there in the first place, and apparently is illegal to use this system in some countries, this site works the same way the social credit score in china works. the part that worries is, that every licensed server uses this site, if you get banned in 1 server, the others will ban you too. there's no such thing as an individual server ban. 
this system has being abused many times and many players are being falsely banned, every ban leaves a record and reasons, the reasons vary from teamkilling, hatespeech, to unknown, what does unknown mean? don't know but you ll get banned anyway.

and yes you can get banned for ""hate speech"" so whenever you want to banter or jokingly use slurs or curse at someone, you will get banned, and be labeled hate speech or ""trolling"".  if any admins are around, if you accidentally kill an admin, whenever ally or foe, expect to get banned. you will get no warnings. though if you try to appeal, even with evidence, they will ignore it. if you try to get help from other people in the community they'll say you deserved it, or act be passive aggressive with you, saying how you shouldn't ruin other people's game or be rude to others, despite having not witnessing it, they're quick to mistreat you. and its disgusting behavior. 

the people saying this are most likely bootlicker clan members, and related, because they assume what you did was wrong with no basis, ""guilty until proven innocent' is how you'll be treated, its not a helpful community, and they want you out more than in. 
overall clan servers are abusive, sketchy and scummy.
people take this game way too seriously and many are very petty and opportunistic, people who never served the army acting like they did, and are running these servers with no purpose in life. 

3) admins are the lowest of the low, so are clans members, they act like gangsters, they're constantly power tripping, doesn't matter the reason they will treat you either with passive aggressiveness, and will assume you are guilty despite being falsely banned, arbitrary judgment, ambiguous rules, hypocrites, straight up lying and gaslighting. they play favorites and manipulate how the game goes in their servers. some of them will do anything if you sound like a girl. try it and watch how the asthmatic mods follow you around.
every clan is an echochamber, they have the gang mentality with no backbone, their only courage is the ban button and hivemind.
they are power tripping sc-m who want  people to use their discord servers for anything, they dont follow their own rules and will gaslight you in being the wrong one. if you're not one of them they will assume you're guilty and demonize you, you cannot question them and you cannot reason with them, its like reddit 2.0. a bunch of gravy seals & special basement operators.
those servers also have other servers in other ""military"" games, it would be wise to blacklist those servers, because they're a bunch of greedy corrupt lowlifes. no integrity, no guilt, no shame, very tribal and primal behavior. hard to believe they lasted this long in life.

Conclusion#) this game is being ruined by admin/clan abuse and have no consequences, as noted by another reviewer, ive experienced what he has, and has 1.4k hours, if i only experience this for only 80 hours, you'll experience this sooner, any mistake you make will be capitalized by petty lowlifes, as more greedy scummy admins who have it out for everyone are banning all server users, with their site claiming banning over 90,000+ players.
the community ban site should not be a feature, and the developers should take action on that. this will kill the player-base.

seeing that this company has hired known greedy CEOs, and how developers were offering leaks of upcoming content in exchange of leaving positive reviews, this company has shown me that its irresponsible, greedy, and shameful, despite how good they craft a game, it won't matter when literal online gangs won't let you play if you hurt their pathetic egos. 

i tried to email support about these concerns, but they refuse to take responsibility.
shame on offworld for allowing this behavior, and refusing to take action, horrible community, horrible company. disgraceful."
"everyone camping get shot 1 time dead, wait for 100 second timer, get out of base get shot again wait 120 seconds, game is absolute garbage, no safezone close to base , hackers everywhere , no replay kill cam, how  is this game even continuing, dont waste your money"
"Tried this during free weekend, too many try hard's being rude to new players. couldn't even enjoy a match in multiple servers"
Fuck this game
"Played the game on promo, no problems. I then bought it and for the first week it was ok. Now it has become unplayable due to  a constant sever disconnect message. 
One day it played fine and once I had paid for it, within a week it was nothing but a source of frustration and irritation."
a game for people who want to feel useless
"edit: ive come back to double down on my review because I have launched it again after successfully reinstalling on a new drive, only to be met with an unskippable video played at deafening audio with no way to turn it down. and after the several minute long video ended it started loading—you mean to tell me that the application chose to do something I didn't ask it do and didnt even do the thing that I asked it to do in the background? have the devs recently read a textbook on how to craft the worst UX possible??

great game, but due to the way it handles updates, you will not be able to play until you find the time to leave steam open for a few hours while it updates, even with an SSD—it has to unpack and repack then validate the entire game, in fact many people find it upwards of 5x faster to entirely uninstall and reinstall when an update of any size comes out."
Game is hella unoptimized cant even get cpu or gpu usage past 50% no matter how I tweak the setting

trash game arma 3 infinitely better than this shit game is not all that
this game is not fun
Badmins banning you because their feelings got hurt coupled with Chinas social credit system makes this game lame as hell
game has gone to S H I T
"Squad was a good game. Unfortunately the devs decided to stick with people who either have no aim or a big skill issue. The whole mechanic was only changed for the majority of people who simply couldn't achieve anything in the round because their aim was so bad that they couldn't do any kills or anything else. That's why the devs thought ""Hey, let's listen to Timmy, who loves the game very, very much but unfortunately wasn't much help in his squads in his 2 years of playing time"". Now if someone says ""This is all for the sake of realism""... So a trained US MARINE who is trained for endurance, strength and stamina doesn't run out of steam after a 500 meter sprint. 

[h1]To the devs:[/h1] 
Thanks for destroying a good game like the people at F.....g arrowhead game studios. Maybe you'll bring back the good old squad after all. But I don't really believe it.


[h1]For the player who would like to buy this:[/h1] 
leave it. Don't invest your money in game studios that destroy a game senselessly without any rhyme or reason.

"Terrible performance for an old ass game, runs like absolute pile of dogshit.
Devs couldn't deal with performance issues for years now."
someday the game not work alot crashs
The game went in the wrong direction...
"it wont load, cant play the game i payed 4. nice"
"I want to like this game, here is why I don't. I have friends, I want to play with them most of the servers a near full I can't join up with friends and be on the same team. Instantly annoying and resulting in me not wanting to play this game."
"Revisiting this game after a few years (I forgot basically everything) and being a noob in this game feels like being a toddler fighting alongside the navy seals. People know you are a burden and don't care to explain anything to you. Getting toxic reactions by ""veterans"" for asking noob questions on a so called ""new player friendly server"" is asinine.

Not for me."
trash community
"Riddled with cheaters, has the worst anticheat (easyanticheat) and server owners and admins do nothing. on top of this the people who play it are brain dead and treat the game like COD"
"Honestly, I think Squad is an amazing game and is really fun to play for hours on end... IF you can get the game to function correctly.

I am not recommending this game to other people because I am one of the people who is bogged down with audio bugs, and it does not matter how many 6+ year old Reddit threads I go down with people who have the same problem, or how many times I go to their official Discord requesting assistance, nothing seems to be working or fixing the problem, rendering the game un-playble.

I either have no audio what so ever after launching the game and getting through the trailer to the main menu, or on the chance I can get audio to function, it is entirely mono-sound coming only out of one headphone. Which makes playing the game impossible considering everything at this point sounds like it is coming from your left, while you're essentially deaf in your right ear.

It did not matter how many verification of game caches, re-installs, PC restarts and other long-shot Googled attempts, nothing worked, and Squad was the ONLY game this issue is present in. It has become prevalent to me that OffWorld realizes this game-breaking bug exists (There are unanswered threads on Reddit/online that are, at this point in 2024, over 5-6 years old), but a very small minority of players ever face this issue so it is something they have no idea how to fix, or don't want to spend the time to actually fix it.

My review will remain the same until there is a resolution for this fix, as due to mono-audio, IF you can even get any audio at all to function, makes playing a FPS game impossible (Unless you want a 1/2 Helen Keller experience)."
"Game-breaking bug introduced in most recent update (v8.1) that will not load the game beyond the new intro movie. Game has been out of early access for close to 4 years and despite being fun at times and offering a unique experience, is consistently a buggy mess lacking features its contemporaries offer."
runs very poorly for a game that fully released in 2020..
"The game's performance seems to get worse and worse with each update. The last one forcing me to stop playing it. The gameplay is wonky and unintuitive and a lot of things are incredibly unpolished (lack of respawn option, chat, spawn menu). For a game this old, it still feels like it's in early access. The developers focus on adding new weapons and vehicles which are just re-skins of old weapons. The game is riddled with cheating and exploiting.

I would not recommend this game and instead would point you to projects who's developers seem to actually love their game, i.e. Arma. Reforger does everything squad does but better."
dogshit devs dogshit game only good with mods
Differs vastly from the old BF games as well as ARMA tons of time running around before you get in an engagement and ends pretty quickly. Cant drive or operate vehicles without your squad leaders permission which is also super annoying.
Just play Arma
"The game is a wash. I hear it used to be good until, ICO whatever that is. But, it sucks either way. I paid $30 for the game and after running it for only 3 hours and learning how bad it was, I was denied a refund. The restrictions on equipment operation in game, the incredible lack of weapon interface options, the lack of being able to launch a simple custom server/lobby unless you own or rent a server, the extremely large hole in available control mapping options, the disdain shown to new players by a large part of the player base. It's just really really bad on pretty much all fronts. I've tried to make the best of it and force myself to play but after about 15 mins of it, I can't handle the amount of suck with the game."
This game has been out too long to have this many glitches an bugs
potato ahh game
Не играйте в это
"i got this game in like 2021 when i had a potato pc and got 50 fps, shortly after i get a good pc and averaged 120 fps. now with the good pc i get 50 fps again because of these updates. I have to use dlss and it doesnt look good and 50 fps still?"
"Long and drawn out, very rarely do you have a whole team that will truely work together when that is one of the main draws for the game. Fairly realistic and plays ok, but you feel like a 250 lb out of shape person. Games still shit"
"Залупа, а не игра.В ебучий технике кебабов пушка на танке не перезаряжается."
i loved this game. struggled with my mic a bit. but i wanted to play again recently but my audio output device cant be selected. I've tried everything. i don't want to give up on this game so maybe a bad review will get some attention on the problem and someone will help me
great game fix ur server list its been a year u fuckwits
"(Would prefer INFORMATIVE over NOT RECOMMENDED)

FYI: The system requirements on the steam page have not been updated in multiple years and it has been showing since at least a year or so.

Squad is a very poorly optimized game that is heavily CPU dependent. According to the system requirements ""any"" 6 core CPU should suffice for ""recommended"" but this is false. Even 6 core CPUs like the Ryzen 5 2600, the  i5-9400F or the i5-10400F paired with the usual GPUs will not put you over more than around 70 fps on low-to-lowest settings, occasionally dipping below 60 fps (sometimes down to 30 fps depending on the situation in game e.g. lots of smoke or particle effects).

Two examples for specs that can run Squad on higher settings without problems are a Ryzen 7 5700X paired with an RX 7600 XT  or a Ryzen 5 7600X paired with an RTX 3070."
dead game f**k ico ruined the game
"Разработчикам лично в глотку кончал, после множественных багов трубы, когда она у тебя не хочет заряжатся, или когда ставишь мину и она не закапывается.
Хотя-бы с армы3 воровали-бы, игру делали ослоёбы."
"wtf, i bought squad 3 days ago during the 26 dollar steam sale but was just charged full price for the game"
"The game has CONSISTENLY gotten worse over time. It has no right to run this poorly with the visuals and effects the game offers. The fact games like Hell Let Loose have such better performance is insane. 

Until the devs actually look into bettering performance this is sadly not worth the money,"
I bought it during free weekend and had if for a while but then they took it away from me
"""ICO"" Infantry Combat Overhaul , combined with TERRIBLE PERFORMANCE makes this game unplayably bad.
I will always love SQUAD but this is absolutely unacceptable with 0 redeeming qualities left."
"Every few months I come back to this game with friends, hoping to enjoy it. But despite my best efforts, the fundamentals of the game just aren't fun in my opinion. Before the big gunplay update, I usually enjoyed the game, when I could find a server that actually built supplied bases, but after I can't enjoy it anymore. It makes no sense that even the slightest movement completely obliterates any hope of stable aim, and the average third-world child soldier could handle recoil better than whatever ""professional soldier"" you get the misfortune of playing as."
arma franchise is better in every way unless you prefer fast paced gameplay
NO ! don't lie yourself
A new update destroyed the game. I love trying to drive and set up a fob but get stick shoved my ass by a mini gun
bull shit why cant i swim and a small tree stop A 80TON TANK
"This is a mess. pure cahos.
Can't see shit and impossible distiguish allies and enemies.
Want war sim? get Arma3. If not, get Battlefield"
the game/server is so dependent whether you have a good squad lead. 1 out of 20 you'll get a great game and you'll fall in love. then the next 19 you'll spend 10 minutes running doing nothing with no leadership and die to do it again.Honestly play a game that's more forgiving. this game sucks.
"god i wish the infantry combat overhaul wasn't added, i've seen malnourished somalian child soldiers handle weapons better"
Aiming is extremely clunky and it's 100x harder to see enemies in this game than it is in real life. There is legitimately nothing realistic about how the shooting mechanics work. If you sprint for 2 seconds you can't accurately aim iron sights 10 feet in front of you for 5 minutes. Basically just a walking simulator until you get 1 shot killed from a half mile away
"I had tons of fun with the game play, but the players could be toxic and rude, as well as unkind. Despite this, I think it was a fairly fun game."
"most veteran players i've encountered are just elitists or trolling new players, especially the indonesian players as someone who's playing in the asia server. first 2 days was fun, but went downhill from there. i do not recommend this to casual players, you will feel left out a lot of the time."
"Love squad, stopped playing cause none of my friends played. Redownloaded and now I can't even make it to the main menu. Just see the new intro talking about what squad is and then black screen with three loading dots bottom right and it never stops."
"Unfortunately, the devs are more interested in making skins and silly emotes than actually fixing bugs and game issues.
Best thing to do is just sit around all game, good luck trying to shoot after you move 10ft."
"Absolutely horrendous gunplay, literally play Insurgency Sandstorm or Hell Let Loose, shooting  in a first person shooter game must first and foremost be fun."
"the greatest advertisement for HLL and similar games.
-ultrawide support is busted completely
-random fps drops
-annoying UI
-gay server rules universally"

i didnt even get to play the game
can't join any server
"Game looks like crap, I cant see anything."
its shit
"The game has been nothing but issues.  I have ""played"" for 7 hours according to Steam but I have maybe 3 hours in games.  Of that time I spent 90% of it running to find contact.  Between terrible graphics, crashing games, kicked from ques because they take too long, turtle pace game play; I can honestly say this wasnt worth the $20 I paid."
ICO absolutely ruined this game. Movement is punished severely. The optimal way to play this trash is to sit prone in a bush.
Fuck these people.
i hate this game
"This game somehow rivals No Man's Sky for the title of ""worst tutorial in a game"". Im going to keep playing the game, but the tutorial is dog shit and I hope the devs always have rocks in their shoes and flies in their rooms while they try to sleep. I hope the devs stub the same toe several times throughout the day. I hope the devs have spotty internet which prevents them from playing online games. I hope the devs favorite snack is discontinued. I cant think of any other bad things but i just really need these devs to suffer. Ill change my review if a better tutorial is made"
"1. run across map to fight
2. get killed by something you cant see
3. repeat"
"Well, its a nice game but got some problems: i have to wait 5 seconds to go inside vehicle.I would understand if an animation is ocorring during it like on Arma 3. Something else: my guns dont pierce walls like they should because i shot in direction of someone's head and a aluminium sign was on our way and it saved the enemy from a 7.62 calibre. I understand the enemy dont dying imediantly on some type of walls but on wood and aluminium barriers it shall not stop the bullet. The enemy shall have died. On arma 3 buildings fall but on this game it doesnt happen. Also, was confusing to choose weapons when i started. On arma 3 the arsenal is much more easier. When enemy talk in radio i shall listen if im close to him because this is what prob happen in reality. Granades shall pierce walls or push them out of place since a explosion happens and fragments are spread around the area: u can check by the video of Boston's Pressure Cooker Bomb being remade. I played for 2 days and still not understand what i can do with the resources. 
    I liked how hard was to get a kill. I remember when i was prone and shot. Was like nobody knew about me till i shot: cammo and prone seems really work here instead of arma 3 and getting a kill may be hard as in a war being a rifleman. 
    Arma 3 still being better and Arma Reforger seems to be better than both. I just didnt bought Reforger yet because of how many people still play the Arma 3 and things on workshop. Also, i dont know how is steam's workshop of this game."
"bought this game for the sole intent of playing as a sniper but the retarded devs thought a class system that sets a limit on the amount of players that can play each class per game is a great idea.........

like this game is 70 fucking dollars let me play what ever the fuck i want to play in the manner which i want to play it. 

imagine forcing players into certain roles they dont want to play simply because you don't have a NASA pc and don't load into each game in exactly 0.2 seconds because there are other players racing to pick the class you want to play. absolute dog shit."
"Very boring game, forcing too realistic although not too realistic too.
How can a soldier shoot a gun like an amateur, it is very difficult in this game to shoot a gun even though we are a soldier in this game."
This game is just plain horrible.
"***WARNING*** Edit to my first review: ***WARNING*** Don't think about getting a refund if you even just do the training for 3 hours like I did. I never actually got to play a match due to the toxic bullshit in this game. Do not waste your money.

Its hard to recommend this game, I'd love to but I can't. How does one stay in a match because I either get kicked from the squad I join or out of the entire match due to being brand new to the game. So I'm guessing you either have to find a group outside the game then jump in with them or just mindlessly keep joining till someone allows you to play which is bullshit."
Not worth it
it's lagginf
Game rework made it bad
"poorly optimised, runs 40 fps unless you have a ryzen threadripper or intel 19 or something.
UI is terrible and confusing.
Game cannot find servers with less than 2000 ping"
What the fuck is this latest update
wasn't for me I'm not happy and I wasn't having any fun thats just me someone else can probably have fun with this but not me
They changed the way aiming works to lower the skill ceiling for cringe ass LARPers

"Dear Steam Support,

I recently purchased Squad after trying it during a free play period, but I am now unable to play due to persistent issues with EasyAntiCheat. The game worked perfectly during the trial period, but since purchasing it, I’ve encountered bugs that have rendered it unplayable. Despite the fact that my recent playtime reflects no actual gameplay due to this technical issue, Steam has refused my refund request, citing ""too much playtime."" However, most of this playtime occurred during the free trial period.

I trust that Steam can see the difference between playtime during the free period and after the purchase when the game became dysfunctional. Refusing a refund under these circumstances appears to violate basic consumer protection laws, particularly those that ensure customers receive a functioning product after purchase.

If Steam does not resolve this issue promptly by granting a refund or an appropriate fix, I will explore my legal options, including filing complaints with consumer protection agencies and pursuing chargebacks through my financial institution. Please consider this a formal request for a resolution, and I expect a response within a week.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter."
biggest piece of shit to date
"Movement feels like you are wading through the quick sand, aiming and shooting feels like you have tourettes and everyone is a sweaty roleplayer"
"This game is heavy-based mainly on ""good"" squad leaders on each side.
Good squad leader must have appropriate skill, game knowledge and good communication skills.

But there is a big chance that you will play with strange people with no knowledge of game, so you will experience no tactics, no radio commands, no strategy, no knowledge of basic principles of this game.

If you meet the right players, its very good, but the chance to get good players is low and it can take a lot of games / time.

Dear developers - maybe there should be option to prepick a role before join server to get us chance meet players at positions on which they prefer to play and with this maintain and offer a better game experience.

Game maps are big, strategies are uncounted, so dependance on good squad leaders is key.

But right now the chance of getting good Squad leaders is very random - so game experience itself is random too - often I cannot recommend this experience that i had / have."
"Squad is an overall decent game with great innovated gameplay but, it definitely needs work on the mechanics and realism. It really is a big running simulator, maps are too big for the small amount of players that can be in the server. I would definitely recommend ARMA of squad if you are looking for a better alternative."
"Played during free weekend.

Game has too little information on how to play and what to do. The game is too dependant on other players that have a lot of experience in the game to talk newer players through it. I played in a squad that had a good leader who knew what they were doing, it was somewhat fun. As soon as I was in a squad with everyone new, total chaos. No one knew what to do or where to go. So much stuff is not explained. Some of the community can be toxic too, especially on something like a free weekend where there are a lot of new people on, they get quite upset.

TLDR: Game is not good for new players or casual players."
"Great game when you are actually playing it but god forbid you bring a friend along then its a just a massive headache to try and find the same server........ I got one of my friends this game and he was that frustrated with the server list bs and inability to send/recieve game invites drove him to never play it again :) 
All in all GREAT GAME. Horrendous menu design and menu set up."
"Let's be real, the maps are too large and barren which makes it a pain on normal pc's to render, then players have to render mediocre level of detail so that they can stare at blades of grass as they get shot from any place not directly in front of the gun's barrel. Player characters act as though they have never held a firearm let alone a repeating firearm, and the inaccuracy visually seen from hipfire aids this conclusion. Overall this entire game is clunky, slowly animated, and while the developers went for realism and a simulator experience, they seem to have stepped too far and have actually disconnected the player. If this were truly a realistic first person shooter, the character wouldn't go about in such a clunky manner but fluidly, as this would come from the representation of real world practice and training.  

It CAN be fun with friends but there is no active social tab so you can't party up beforehand and join a server together, if you get separated into another squad you are essentially playing a whole different game than your friends as the map does not lend itself to finding your steam friends nor does it really clarify what areas are active fighting and not. We accept this game as the standard for a realistic military shooter, when really it is the lowest common denominator."
cannon go kaboom and then guns shoot bang bang and dead
This game is very fun but isn't optimized for AMD hardware can't get over 20 fps on low settings with a 6600xt and with this new update it made it worse.
"Hi, i feel like its finally time to write a review...  i feel like this is no longer the same game that i paid $50 for. i hardly see any actual teamwork anymore. i saw more teamwork in the game pre-ico than now. it feels like the more that the dev's (try) to push teamwork, the less of it there is. not to mention, as a heli pilot, every update makes helis less fun to fly. when mapvoting came out and they removed a bunch of layers, they also made it so that helis have a spawn delay with most units and increased the actual respawn timer for it. and now with this update they added a ""fun"" new heli to fly, yet it only takes one 7.62 bullet to engine it, so if any infantry just shoot in you general direction, you die... not only that, but they changed everything about how the helis fly. they all feel fat and slow now,  and it feels like every update they change the helis in some way but never put anything in the patch notes about it. like when they added a line in the code in the new update that makes helis fly away if the pilot gets out with the engine on, even when completely landed. again, they dont even put any of these changes in the patch nots."
"do you want to play a game where you shoot a gun like a 10 yr old girl and have 0 ability to even remotely stabilize the firearm in a realistic manner in any position? yeah me either, this game used to be fun."
"the game is good, on a base level. the community isnt what it used to be, no one plays together or with a mic, its just a bunch of silent murder hobos wasting tickets every game. then every time they update they dont communicate or work with the major mod authors who are carrying this game on their back as if they were atlas, so every time they update its like 2 months with no mods and just a skeleton of a playerbase. game is good with mods"
Good game but use a better anticheat. EAC is more like Easy To Cheat.
"Este juego exprimio al máximo mi RX570. Sé que mi GPU está un poco vieja, pero de verdad creo que este juego necesita urgentemente un trabajo de optimización. A pesar de eso, es un  buen fps de corte realista, aunque tiene algo de walking simulator.

This game stressed the shit out of my rx570. I know my gpu is a little old but I seriously think this game needs an urgent optimization work on it. Despite that, it's a cool game, a liitle of walking simulator though."
without friends this is really boring.
Unable to join any multiplayer servers.
"THIS GAME HAS BECAME SO UNPLAYABLE AND UNENJOYABLE SINCE THE SQUAD OVERHAUL IM JUST A REGULAR GAMER AND I DON'T ENJOY NOT BEING BALE TO SEE SHIT THROUGH MY SCOPE OR MY SOLDIER HAVING TERRIBLE AIM SHOOTING ENEMIES 20 FEET INFRONT OF ME , I CAN AIM BETTER THAN THIS IN REAL LIFE , THIS IS FAR FROM REALISTIC PLS STOP UR DESTROYING THE GAME JUST LIKE TARKOV"
"So buggy, combat is janky. When I heard free to play wekeend I was like 'yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaah' and then I played it for the first time and it reminds me of something someone built in their room with a limited team throwing Dayz and somethign else together."
"Weapon mechanics suck, too much recoil, the body movement feels like you are dragging a slug around....just Go buy ARMA 3"
"Overrated. Huge bf2player. Sky is mine. Hello dragon valley!?
Honestly I had high hopes for squad. I tried it,  the gameplay just sucks… no need for constructivist. Love taro bf3,4. Even arms 3 more playable to me. Mechanics of game are strange and certainly didn’t win me. Game overrated to much unneeded hype. Gun play awful and after nothing much interesting. I thought this going to be bf2.0"
"Squad is a dishonest enterprise with false advertisement.
Admin abuse is the norm.
Kicked out of vehicle to steal it.
Kicked out of squad to steal it.
There are no official servers, only admin abused ones. *""YoU DiDnT ReAd RuLeS"" imbeciles incoming*
INTENTIONAL Teamkilling renders the game unplayable.

The single most toxic community I have seen, especially the ethnically abused servers. 

Squad devs are dishonest over false advertisement of a cooperation game. Clans abusing admin rights occupy one faction and the other faction is filled with randoms (No choice to pick faction!).

There is nothing done against admins or anyone cheating, nor can be done.

Give me my money back! Keep your stupid teamkilling admin abused theft called ""squad"". SHAME!"
"My experience so far is that the game sucks and I would rather wait at the DMV for my license photo. 2.5 hours in, and I just played for 30 minutes as my squad mate couldn't drive a vehicle across a map, fail to get gas and I had to run all the way across a map for the game to finally end. 2.5 hours in and I've only had the opportunity to shoot at 1 person. Yes, BF and COD suck, but at least when I am in a game, I'm playing and not riding in a Humvee for 30 minutes to not play. I would rather just by ""Public Bus Riding"" the game."
"Refuses to connect to any servers, so since this is a multilayer game, it's completely useless. What's more, Steam has refused a refund despite this. What a scam."
"A s**ity want to be military sim. Terrible mechanics and comms system, very buggy and poorly designed maps. Fallujah the game runs and looks better than this ****"
Its like playing with Unity Graphics like SCP SL
SED I CANT DO JIHAD
"SQUAD was better when the game was focused more on Infantry and some limited infantry vehicles,
meaning i was liking the game alot Pre Alpha V11, pre Alpha V10 was Perfect.

I didnt like the Update where it was suddenly required to use crewman kits to drive BTR´s,
I didnt like the change on the rally point system, 
I didnt like the change on the FOB/HAB System.

overall long intense Infantry firefights where fun, with every update they have become less and less.
with every new Country that was added Britain / Canada, and the overall adding of more and more long distance scopes for regular rifleman,those shootouts have become almost non existent. 

as well as well as MEGA FOBS are not a thing anymore, due to changes on the FOB/HAB system.

Game needs a Mod where 80% auf the Squad is Iron Sights only, and those changes are reversed.

think im gonna pass on SQUAD and try SQUAD44."
CCP copy of battlefield mod 😂😂😂
"I really enjoyed squad initially. The biggest its drawback was that shooting didn't feel that great in terms of bullet impacts. The enemy death animations also were sort of disconnected from you, meaning you didn't really feel like you killed a guy. Everything else, including the gunplay itself, was very much enjoyable. 

Now, I haven't played Squad for a few years, and when I came back, I was shocked how the shooting became so much worse. The guns' sounds are a lot better, there's this heaviness to your shots, but at the same time the recoil has been exaggerated to pre-recoil patch Tarkov levels. Like you're not playing as a trained soldier but as that soldiers' mom who never held a gun in her life. Even single-fire M4 is hard to keep on stationary target, there's so much random variation in the sprays, it feels miserable to shoot guns now. DMRs force you to make huge pauses between shots if you wanna stay anywhere near the target. I understand there may have been some balancing decisions they had to make, but right now the game feels awful to shoot. There's close to zero individual skills involved, because even if you do have the aim, you can't control your gun no matter how much you practice since the recoil is so random and sideways. This forces you to single fire, but even single fire feels terrible because it recoils super hard to either of the sides, once again forcing you to fire even slower if you want to hit your shots. I don't understand why a mil sim would opt for such a poor balancing strategy while also making one of the key things, which most mil sims are about - shooting guns - comletely horrible. 

Pistols have insane recoil too, as if you shoot with one arm, which also happens to be broken in 3 spots. 

I don't really like the way shooting feels right now, so I can't recommend it, especially because it felt a lot better a few years ago. If you don't care about guns being bad and unpleasant to shoot, then you might like the game, but if you value having some 'realness' to your guns, then it's not a game that delivers that."
The shooting mechanics are horrible. You either move the weapon to fast or to slow and its very shaky. Grande throwing mechanics remind me of a 90s PC game. In fact most the game looks like its was made in 2005.
Every action you do in this game feels like your doing it underwater
absoloutley noone playing????
Really stupid game.DONT BUY!!!!!
"Played for the YT Cool Mods.........Zero Cool Modded Servers..............Bad Experience.
Luckily I didn't bought this Garbage."
30FPS SIMULATOR
dont buy this game its not worth.... toxic community full of trols waste of money
"floating rocks, spawning on enemies, being killed by friendlies in smoke. I don't get it."
"Game is garbage, never see the enemy, character never holds the gun steady, 2 rounds of 7.62 doesnt kill anyone. Absolute garbage game. WASTE OF TIME"
game isn't fun
"Do not take it wrong, this game is very good, but not really new players friendly.
However, there are so many points which people need to think about when buying this game.

The most frustrating point is that you will get kicked for alot of reasons. Teamkilling is one reason to be kicked, but this is not a point since it just happens and you have the possibility to appologize. 
E. g. you get pushed as a squad leader and you do not have the correct kit and have not possibility to change it when you are in the battlefield or even do not realize you are the leader now, because you are in a firefight right now.

The next point is that most players lock their squads with one or two players, so you end up mostly alone or with two other players in a squad, together with the restriction above. However, you get kicked out of a squad sometimes, because you have 0 hours in this game? People just do not want you to play with. I mean everyone started low once, but this is not the way to treat new players in such a game.

Additionally, the key bindings are very strange. If you want to bind something to a new key, they are not disbanded. This means, if you bind grenades to ""E"", then you will end up switch to grenades while leaning to the right side.

I really wanted to enjoy this game, since the setting and the idea is very good, but it was simply not possible."
"bad for new players, game is just bad"
you can buy this game if you have friends and a 4090
$20 game at best. Floppy arms for a trained Soldier. Spend most of the game getting bossed around by the squad leader by the time you get any action the game ends Hell let loose is a better game
"cheap arma ripoff, istg"
honk shoo
boring
game crashes 10 times before you even get into a server browser............
"While I have been enjoying some aspects of the game, there are too many ways this game doesn't respect your time.
The fact that someone can just kick you out of a vehicle half way to the battle front because they aren't your squad leader is extremely dumb. 
You can then choose to then A: Leave the game and spend 10+ minutes to find a new game B: spend 10+ minutes running to the front or C: Hope there's water nearby to drown yourself. There's no option to respawn, you have to ask permission to your squad leader to even drive a vehicle, and no one stops for you on their way to the front, they just run you over. 

I enjoy the game when I can play the game, but this game gives too much faith in the players to not make other peoples experiences miserable by team killing."
"so many bugs, sever lists wont show, so many black screens, connection timeouts etc"
just die from nowhere simulator
Bad performance
Di map nah mek no sense an hard fi read. No sight pon wah a gwan. Bumbaclot! I an I!
"Redownload to play with a friend. Get stuck in an insanely loud intro video I can't even ALT+F4 to close, then stuck in an endless loading screen. Sick.

Update: I get to keep watching this video over and over. Best part is it somehow overrides my audio when I literally mute the game, and forces my audio mixer into not responding til the game is forced closed when I can finally get the task manager to respond. So sick."
t
ass
this game is absolute dog water dont waste your time
"This game's physics are realistic, They are so real it's like I'm really there and the 100 player battles are just so exciting that when the game finally loads on my DELL optiplex, My computer freezes and gives me a nice blue screen :( pls address a fix to this game now!!!!!!!!



my pc has a gt 710 and a intel core i7 2nd gen and 8gbs of ddr3 ram

Is it good enough?!?!?!?!??!?!?!!??"
"2010s gameplay, 2000s graphics, shitty experience. I regret free weeekend trial, not to mention buying this crap"
"Terrible, got the game for free weekend and its downloaded, waited 1+ hour to play it[due to downloading] and when i enter the game the warning for epilepsy pops up then it kicks me from the game please get ti fixed devs"
TRASH ASS GAME < GUN WILL NOT SHOOT BUGGY CLANKY BAD GUN PLAY JUST TRASH
"playing this game is miserable, 99% of the time, you are in a group with utter idiot and half the of that time they cant even organize getting out of base. most of the games you get in, the squad barely communicates, if you enjoy milsim but are a solo player, id avoid this shi entirely."
this game is ass dont play
"hi all, game is one battlebit clone with some arma battlefield features. what is bad you cant see right who is enemy and fx is not 2024 standard at all, more like battlebit minecraft cube explosions.... so no buy but game have good basis. may some like it, i play battlebit also only occasionaly."
Its only fun when you dont care about absolutely lighting up your teammates
"Running animations are a bit moonwalk type and feels like from free unity game, project reality older but better."
"Spent 2 hours trying to find a match. Tried every fix on google, still cant get into a game. L"
Downloaded it for the free weekend trial and glad I did. The audio settings are so atrocious I wasn't able to get audio in and out at the same time even with 3rd party software recommended by the devs. save your money.
Actually enlisting and going through BCT is more fun than this game.
"Squad is a blast, but boy, can it be confusing! The game’s concept is super fun and unique, but it could really use more tutorials and training. I mean, how are we supposed to figure out the game’s ecosystem, communication, reporting, and map interactions without some guidance? And what the heck are FOBs? Who makes them, and what do they need?

And then there’s the squad leader. Who is this mysterious figure, and what are they supposed to do? They definitely need some special training. Same goes for the commander. Both roles should have mandatory tutorials before they can lead a squad or command anything. And the commander’s abilities? Yep, those need a tutorial too.

I know, they have a ""minor"" tutorial out there, but that doesn't cover even 1 tenth of the game's techniques and hidden stuff.

FYI, I only played the trial game during the free weekend event, and honestly I am not sure if i'm going to buy it or not, it still needs some refinements and improvements."
PIP SCOPES ruin your performance
"Do you enjoy gameplay that involves:

Waiting around for something to happen 90% of the time?

Clunky, awkward infantry combat?

Low quality, clunky character animations?

Frustrating map and game-mode design?

Then this game is for you!

Seriously though, avoid this low effort garbage fps unless your IQ is in the bottom 1% percentile."
Everyone who plays this game sounds like they eat crayons
"1. Spawn in main base
2. Wait one hour to get into a moving vehicle
3. Arrive in the middle of nowhere
4. Get blown up by an RPG"
What the frack?! Does not work for me.
fucking shit ass game my teammates killed me more than the enemy
"Just another tacticool shooter who thinks its ""realistic"" to make it literally impossible to aim if bullets are fired within your general area. Last time I checked we weren't using bullets with explosive charges attached so there's no reason there would be any kinetic force from a bullet impacting concrete in front of you. 
Even when you're [i]NOT[/b] being fired at the game is constantly fighting you for control since there is [b]no way to stabilize a scope even while prone[/b]. And that's saying nothing about the recoil kicking like a mule.
I've talked with real soldiers who were afraid they'd black out from nervousness when a firefight broke out, but in reality the exact opposite happened as everything became clear."
"This game plays like Arma, with annoying controls, snipers glore and a lot of time-wasting elements. I dont know what else to say its extremely uneventful and a massive majority of your deaths will feel like there is nothing you can do about them."
"""aim""
no
""aim"" 
no
""aim""
yes

rather play any fps from ps3 to today than this empty game"
The scope sway is a mistake. I absolute hate it that you can't even hold your breath or something to control the damn sway.
"Well, the game seems deep and complex. Is is a nice large scale combat simulator. The problem in that complexity is that the tutorials are too shallow and even in the servers marked as ""new player friendly"" people will keep asking you to leave their squads (even before the game starting, so they don't know if you are a good player or etc. They wanna play with the people they know). After this you end up in a squad where no one knows what they are doing or alone. Then the game becomes a random walking simulator.

So, 3/10 for a game that seems nice, but needs to do a lot more work on guiding new players."
"During the tutorial the live fire part had such loud sudden and loud audio (with headset on) that my ear has been ringing in a tinnitus manner. I can only hope I haven't gotten permanent hearing damage, but it's been twelve hours at this point. Not exactly what I was hoping from this game."
"this game has a finnish map but no finnish faction.

unbelievable.

outrageous.

0/5"
it needs to be 13 pluss so me and my friend can play togather and i dont think its is 13 pluss because its famili friendly
hot dog water ass gun play. Not haram
"I cannot believe this kind of game does not support multiple input and TRackIR.
If you want a war simulator. ARMA would be better. even the graphic quality cannot as good as squad, but there are more details in ARMA."
"My opinion is mostly divided when it comes to reviewing this game. It takes time to understand how to play this game well. That said, it is definitely not beginner-friendly. I had to play a couple of real matches to understand what the tutorial section was all about.

The biggest problem for me personally is the gun mechanics. I have played a lot of arcade-style games like Counter-Strike and Insurgency, and the recoil in this game is the worst I have ever seen. Even when using a bipod in the prone position, your character still wobbles. After pressing the button to stabilize, you have to wait an additional five seconds for the aim to temporarily settle, and even then, landing a distant shot feels like a gamble. This only gets worse when you are being shot at by the enemies.

Now combine that with not being able to easily identify teammates from enemies. It becomes a staring contest with the player in front of you who is pointing a gun at you, also appearing to have the same questioning look. You decide to pull the trigger first, only to realize it was your teammate you just killed. Guilt-Quit
It takes some experience to get used to the uniforms of different factions. Until then, you have to constantly rely on opening your map to double-check, as only friendlies are shown on the map. However, this still doesn't stop you from getting killed by your teammates.

Positioning is more important than getting quick kills. It quickly becomes frustrating when the enemy wipes out your entire squad and you have no idea where the shots are coming from—though it can be satisfying when you're the one on the other end. Unlike the games I mentioned, camping is praised here.

Communication is not optional. The game doesn't care if you are an introvert. It forces you to get out of your comfort zone and speak with your squeaky voice. If you don't speak, get ready to be disrespected by other players on the radio or, worse yet, get kicked out of the squad. I mainly blame this on the inability to put markers on the map (unless you are a squad leader) or use pre-recorded voice commands while pointing in a direction, like in other games.

There is a steep learning curve to this game, which I (ironically) admire. You can have fun if you know what you are doing. There are a lot of other team-supportive things you can do besides just shooting at other players.

TL;DR Squad could have been a great game for me, but the frustrating gunplay holds it back. If the shooting mechanics were more manageable, I'd have considered writing a positive review."
"full with a bunch of sweaty, salty, angry, stinky, imbred, overweight, radioactive, full time truck driving australians."
where the fuck i am ?
I joined in wanted to kill other people couldnt find them so i tried to get to them but out of nowhere the game put itself in window mode but the button layout was like in fullscreen
govno
hard to control
ICO ruined this. Rubber noodle arms aren't realistic or fun. Have fun with Tencent draining every last penny with more microtransactions.
"Gun play feels like dog shit, every gun has the recoil of a deagle"
My laptop is too shitty to handle this game. :( OPTIMIZE UR GAME
"Spawned at a fob had to walk all the way to point because my squad leader didn't clam a car, finally got to point after 5 min of running just to get gun downed by some guy with an lmg in a bush (He was my teamate), the game play loop feels clunky and slow for the type of game it is. the only good part of the game is the tanks and helis but there are other games with that... (I played during free weekend to give it a try after seeing videos about it and how fun it is. But i was dissapointed due to only having 2 fun ish interactions throughout the five hours that i played."
nah
"i mean, with all due respect, if you ain't got a whole ass squad to literally ROLEPLAY with, don't even bother, game is absolute trash if you're looking for a good shooter as a single player."
Shitty game with broken server browser
"A steaming pile of horse shit.   

Nothing else worth noting."
i can't get on games can't skip intro
haven't played a worse game to date
mmmm. NO
"游戏的交互趣味全靠百人混战强撑，因为这样可以遇见相对较多的散落遭遇战，[b] 看似需要团队，实则一盘散沙，理解机制后各自为政，人人都是孤狼兵王，说着从别人那捡来的蹩脚圈内笑话，以显自己懂行内道。游戏体验大多就是分了两个派别的PUBG大乱斗。 [/b]当然也有不错的极少数玩家会重视互动和配合，也只是极少数，更多是爱开麦的pugs，聒噪不安，自得其乐。

       The interactive fun of the game is all supported by the melee of 100 people, because in this way you can meet relatively many scattered encounters, which seem to require a team, but in fact, they are scattered, and after understanding the mechanism, they go their own way, everyone is a lone wolf soldier king, saying lame jokes picked up from others, in order to show that they know the inner way. Most of the game experience is PUBG Smash Bros. divided into two factions. Of course, there are also a very small number of players who will attach importance to interaction and cooperation, and only a very few, more of them are pugs who love to open the microphone, noisy and restless, and enjoy themselves."
NO
"Awful new player experience.

Join game, Join squad, get kicked from squad, get kicked from game because you aren't in a squad.
Join new game, Join squad, get promoted to squad lead, get kicked because you don't have squad leader kit.

Legit a dogshit new player experience."
would have reccomended about 5 big updates ago but the combat is kinda trash right now
where is the optimization
"Tldr: tried on a free weekend not recommended for people trying to get in to milsims and the toxicity outweighed the people willing to help new players learn 

Tried on a free weekend 
While I can see the appeal of this game coming from arma I also feel like the good players are outnumbered by players who either don't understand that this is a milsim that requires cooperation or are just purely toxic. And while I don't have much time in the game I also feel like the movement is slow clingy and not fun and neither is the aiming its slow shaky and takes to long to recover from recoil. 
The servers marked newbie friendly aren't as friendly as I hoped for. This game had been on my wish lost for quite a while and since playing for a few hours has been removed. I hoped I would enjoy it but I feel like the time barrier to enjoyment is too long"
"Дерьмище игра хочет идти в реализм, но срет поносом себе в трусы сделали бы так как в пабге все было бы намного лучше, а так я зашел сидеть в таверне 30 секунд вместо того что бы рубится ЖЕСТКО и потом встаю и как пьяный наркоман в прицеле меня трусит"
Garbage game. Most maps will have you at 40 fps with a decent computer.
"Barely works on recommended hardware. 5-10 second freezes and sub 40 fps at minimal settings. Gameplay wise it's fine, arcade-ish enough to get right into the gameplay."
server list doesn't work
Too complicated with hard to spot teammates
"The game is awesome. (3.8/10) -- for now until they optimized it then it's auto+5
The teamwork and planning executed beforehand to properly plan victory is very nice.
Playing with friends and absolutely annihilating the enemy team - but then not knowing where you died from.

The game is nice a solid 3.8/10
Why? Because the Developers lack transparency and do not have their priorities set straight.
They need to optimize the game, if you don't have a really good CPU do not play, buy or install."
worst weapon feeling i ever had in a game
"Tried it on the free weekend, glad i did, and not wasted money on this. The game is fine, but the community is extremely hostile towards new players and experienced players dont help when asking questions.  On top of that servers kick you for a lot of reasons, even if they automove you to a new role that you don't have the appropriate kit for... Don't get it if you plan on casually playing, the veterans don't want you in their game."
"Great game and simulates large scale conflict really well with quite a lot of strategic depth.
But, shooting a gun and basic firefight feels very janky."
Can't easily join game with friends and not new player friendly.
"game is fine but community is unbearable. experienced players won't teach new players just be annoying and tell you to play the tutorial when you ask a simple question. Do not buy this game, the experienced players don't want you in their game and they don't want to teach you, its unfortunate."
"Good game but it sucks on my computer, takes 15 minutes before it decides to log me into a match"
"This game is clunky and absolute dog crap. Under the guise of being ""realistic"" when it's just absolute shite. The player base is nothing but a bunch of douche bags who drive everyone new away who has the desire to even bother trying this turd of a game. Do NOT waste your money I am sure that there will be a better game around the corner than this sack of petrified crap."
WHY IT DOSN'T SUPPORT STEAM FAMILY!!
nah
"Boring game, no1 wants to play squad lead, no1 plays game properly and puts down spawn points, so every match is a walking simulator. do not recommend."
"Game looks rough and plays worse. The animation makes it feel like your arms are made of wet spaghetti and your legs are cheese strings. After launching you get blasted repeatedly with warnings about needing to put your mic on so you can pretend to be in the army alongside Kev who works at a Tescos in Rotherham. You then clumsily stumble around some dilapidated copy pasta environments until you accidentally shoot a bot team mate and then get told to apologise in the general chat channel by a all-caps pop-up. I guess this isn't for me, so I'd probably give it a neutral if that were a thing."
nop
"Thought good things about this game,sadly it’s very boring, not newbie friendly at  all. Prone simulator ."
"The game is boring and a complete waste of time, if you want something similar/military experience just buy Arma instead.. Running for 30 minutes to get killed by a tank is quite the experience"
"VERY BAD GAME, THIS GAME IS SHT!!!!!!!"
"Barely got to play it when i bought it back in lord-knows-when

Came back now as friends are playing the free weekend, and nomatter the methods i attempt i cannot find any servers, even though all my friends can.

Quite literally, not even excagerating, unplayable for me."
to many toxic team mates
NO
"I downloaded this game as part of a free play event. I was hoping to see if this game was as welcoming as Arma and Insurgency. The first game I play, all the squads are either full or locked, so I have to start my own squad. I then get pulled into a squad by an admin just before the prep phase ends. I then try to get into the troop carrier that my squad members are in but before I could get in, they drive off, leaving me to have to walk a few kilometres to the AO. As soon as I get there I am blown to bits by an enemy APC due to how open the area was and the fact that I had no mode of transportation thanks to my squad abandoning me. Compared to Arma 3, which I paid full price for, I would not buy Squad even though it is 60% off. Unless you join a game full of entirely new players, this game will not be welcoming."
Audio does not work.
"-Spawn in on base, walk out of base, instantly get sniped by a lone enemy who flanked in the trees with no way to see or counter him. 
-Spawn in on a point getting attacked, try to do literally anything like peek a window or peek onto a street only to get blown up or shot by enemies you can't see
-Finally see a enemy running across a field i can shoot and kill, oh wait it was a teammate i just killed because there is literally no way to differentiate enemies and friendlies because most of the time the blue name tag that appears when you aim at friendlies doesn't appear.

Game suffers from the same problem all mil-sims do, you try and play the game and you instantly die for it. I spent the whole time sitting in the base because the second i walked out i would instantly die from unseen enemies. I never saw a single enemy during that time either, even in CQC situations. Only time i had fun is when i watched my spawn point get peppered by a gatling gun but i couldn't even enjoy it because the game shat itself and went down to like 10 fps

That and the game has poor optimization and the tutorial kinda sucks and tells you stuff like peek a enemy MG to suppress him or shoot the hull of a Abrams to kill it."
"For a realistic shooter, everything feels so fast to arcady feeling. Combat for some reason doesn't feel rewarding. Vehicles are garbage from both physics aspect to sound effects. Whole UI could really use overhaul - too much text, needs to be simplified. Players are nice. When compared to HLL, although it does not really feel much similar, Squad feels like more progressive uglier sibling for younger generation. I did not like this at all."
"The gamplay is not enjoyable at all. its slow, laggy. you have to walk hundred miles before getting shot out of no where. the shooting mechanics suck. i am surpirsed at the guys who gave it good review. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL. i would rate it 2/10."
BTEC HLL
"wow the first 3 minutes tells me all the thing that will get me kicked or banned. then drops me into a parking lot 55 miles away from the city.  oh I need to be in a squad to enter the vehicle...

good thing they have free weekend so everyone can see get their 8 minutes in before uninstalling."
"i have huge lag spike when playing with servers, 10/10"
"They still haven't fixed the audio card issues. It's something to do with their use of EasyAnticheat as Halo MCC had the same issue on launch. The opening cutscenes have audio, but the game engine proper refuses to see any output audio device in its settings. 'Shame :("
walking simulator
"Would not recommend, there are so many small super annoying things in the game that should ""make it more realistic"" all it does it reduce playability."
The most fun I've had shooting my friend in the face and reviving him by bandaging his manhood.  Other than that its utter sh!te.
"asthmatic running simulator, don't play if you forgot your inhaler"
"Needing someone to be a delivery boy and drive ammo and construction supplies to the front lines is realistic, not fun. The time it takes to see if who you're aiming at is friendly takes way too long, I know you can identify teams by uniform, but in a game where you can die in one shot, there's no room for hesitation or else you die. I was hoping this was like Hell Let Loose but modern, but unfortunately, Squad chose to put realism over fun."
Nothing like using up 80 gigs of space on your computer just to get hit with the infinite loading screen bug that was never fixed from the start. Be mindful that this is after watching their unskippable 5 minute long intro
this game sucks what game is named squad and you cant even squad up with your friend 0 out of 10 disgusting game. unhappy non customer FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.
"This game literally is so dumb and bad, glitchy and not sense of hit reg, would not recommend ever free"
Terrible.  Unless you have your own team it is nothing but crap.
Please don't waste your time with this trash game. I had so many issues on both my laptop and computer that has different specs to just get the graphics correct that it kept bugging out and making the gaming experience terrible. No thank you.
"LOVED THIS GAME TO THE MAX!...UNTIL free trail . it has become instantly a racist sanctuary. almost every game getting spammed with racism by team and enemy team. server admins do NOTHING at all for the better of the game and neither does the game itself. i know they cant watch everything but a kid joining with the username ""white leader"" spamming the N word shouldnt be hard. 6 games ive played tonight alone and was unable to complete due to a child spamming racism."
it's kinda ass ngl... I wouldn't buy it unless you can try it first
kinda bad ngl
What a piece of shit.  I'm so glad I checked it out during the free weekend and didn't buy it.
horrible shit game do not play it
Fix your broken dumbass game
"Chaos unless you bring your own squad,  everyone has to be on the same page or you get smoked."
Meh
"not gonna, I find this game a lot harder than Hell let loose; and while I'm still relatively new with this game at the time of this review, I understand the fundamentals and everything since I've played hell let loose, but this game is a different breed despite being in the same bag. with the ICO overhaul making gun play a lot more difficult than before just makes this game even more harder; despite it attempting to encourage more suppression and penalize run and guns; while retaining a realistic senses, but this is supposed to be designed from its original mod development of BF2 where it retained realistic aspects but maintained a middle ground because of BF2's engine and gun play, this game is already full of stuff significantly more which is already harder enough to learn especially when your learning solo, and transitioning from a different similar game. Them forcing the ICO aspect isn't a good one because everyone has to significantly change their styles of play with an even more slower pace, more team oriented game; as If they wasn't difficult enough with squads style.

If your considering this game; PLEASE play with friends, it will make it way more easier."
just a nope kind of game cant even use what  you really want. im good glade it was free lol
"wait in 2 min Que. Join losing team. Game resets. Enter gae. Wait few mins for prep faze. Drive 3 mins to point. Build FOB on point. Get artillery striked for 2 mins. die. Fob ded. Ride in vehicle for mins. return to ded fob to arti ded again.  if u get no permission for vehicle run 10 mins...
..... ... . ...
BUT IF YOU HAVE A SQUAD... this game can be fire."
"Take all the bad aspects of Arma, the walking, long distances, being one shot. 

The horrible, community of Mil sim units. 

Now make that an entire game! 

If you like Milsim stuff, and long distances, and working with teams. This game will be great for you. 

If you hate walking 15 minutes to objectives, being one shot from god knows where. Spending a lot of time doing very little to get set up.  This game isnt for you.

It knows its crowd it has its crowd. I just wish for an actual good fucking battlefield game to come back out."
dogshit boring walking simulator
i wouldnt mind the into video but at least make it so it doesnt bloody stutter.
"Worst tutorial experience, bad graphics, UI meh. Really hard to identify enemies to friendlies, only close encounters to distinguish them. Like my max average kills are around 2-3 people.. By the way thanks for free weekend, I'll just save and spend my money elsewhere :)"
Actual garbage. I am glad I never paid for it.
Battlefield V
Absolutely wank
"Pros:
- Decent audio design
- Decent realism

Cons:
- Poor gameplay mechanics 
- Shitty optimization and performance
- Bad graphics quality
- The worst User interface/experience
- Wonky controls"
"Looks bad, shoots bad, plays bad."
"I can see why this game needed a free weekend, you're better off hiking in the woods because that's the majority of what you'll be doing in this game."
Very chaos game no body follow the leaders instruction and you cant recognize enemies from teammate and most of the time you get killed by friendly fire
what a disgusting pile of garbage
A big pile of laggy poopoo
"ruzzian supporters! you can play under their flag, how come? just remove that and someone will maybe come back"
Almost can't believe that I still need to look at something like that in 2024. :*(
"Can't play squad with squad, misleading title"
"game's called squad and you cant team up with friends, good job devs"
Can't play squad with squad
"The game really plays like battlefield - there a a good server browser, classes, squads, kits etc. and lots of different nationalities you can play as. Anyway I was hugely disappointed as the game isn't much fun at all.

As for gameplay itself, the map is confusing and its difficult to know what to do and where to go to. The landscape maps are much too large (often with little cover) and you find yourself just running round for ages looking for someone to shoot. Die to a sniper, respawn and then run for 5 minutes looking for an enemy, rinse repeat.

Sound is good but the graphics are quite bad. The game is 4 years old now but it actually looks much older and not much better than Battlefield 2 which came out 19 years ago."
"devs need to revise the keybind rework, i want to use the namepad for something else outside of radio coms however the game severely limits the ability to rebind stuff. even if i set a keybind to numpad it simply doesn't work."
"great concept, very buggy."
Mid and people expect you to roleplay lmao
no
"Its just like Hell let loose but in modern warfare...if you enjoy long respawns and 5m walking until  you find some1 to engage or something then that game is for you.

i dont like that kind of shooting games"
"When you are removed from a squad you just lose your weapon even if you are in middle of a fight. Then you kill them anyway but there is no way to pickup their weapoan, not even ammo or heals. 

You just killed a full squad and they have a running BTR next to you? Well its theirs cause you cant take it even if they are all dead. 

Best tactict is to just sit in any window. And shoot heads. F/O identification sucks. No armbands, not even in city combat.

Also there are no drones."
"Easy Anticheat?  (Basically malware, and not disclosed on store  page.  Store page states ""Valve Anti Cheat"" instead) You only find this out on the loading screen shortly before it crashes.

Waste of 80GB of bandwidth

Hard pass."
"This game has been on my wish list for a while now, so when I saw it on sale I downloaded the trial. Overall, the game has good game mechanics and visuals - but if you plan to play this on a TV (couch gaming), forget it! Some menu interactions could be bigger but the surprise for me is the map coordinate numbers - wowzers, so tiny and unclear! This is extremely illogical as this is meant to be a squad based game. The description box that you get when you hover over each setting is practically unreadable and there are no accessibility options either. Yet another game developer who doesn’t appear to be interested in catering to those who game on a TV and also discriminates those of us with visual impairments. Pity as I would have purchased it otherwise."
"Like so many milsims before, it can get kinda boring eventually from extreme repetitiveness, and is poorly optimised, and extremely buggy.
So many times will you get stuck in walls, sync will make people look like there looking the other direction, and then they start shooting from the back of their head, and so many more bugs.

There can sometimes be cheaters, but they aren't that common, but when there are cheaters theres no point staying on the server anyway. Such as one time when supposedly a player got 61 kills and only died once playing pure CQC.
There are also some maps that just aren't that great because they are completely dominated by vehicles and if you're not in a vehicle then there's nothing to do, because you'll be spawned in an open plain with no cover for as far as the eye can see and some vehicle will eventually kill you while you're looking for any kind of cover.
And this point can be seen as a good or bad thing, but the success of you're team is completely reliant on the competence of your superiors, who 60% of the time are not competent, a lot of the time having the very good idea of; rush the enemy head on and keep respawning until you ""win"" or get defeated.
But when the game is good, its amazing.
Also the community can be very bad at times

Though the ICO systems have been updated, the game still is extremely buggy, poorly optimised and server sync is awful.
And optimisation recently has definitely gotten worse.

On sale for 70% or more, and i definitely would recommend it, otherwise, i think its overpriced for what it is, at the moment.

6.5/10"
"Horrible game for wide screen.
All settings and display issues.
Hopless game ever."
Az önce sıçtım daha optimizeydi.
Terrible game
"Very slow. Very boring. Relies a lot on teamwork to be fun, but if you are playing with randos you often just get people that're messing around. Not a fan of the shooting or vehicles mechanics. Everything felt floaty/janky."
"NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. Toxic community, Bugs happen every minute, AI are stupidly OP, and the game is terribly optimized and no one plays it."
"Poor man Arma 
Imagine the kids toxic behaviour from cod but they're all full grown adult"
if you are a casual cod run and gun type of player this games not for you. To me it was slow game feels poorly optimized. I have a higher end pc and have no problems playing it just feels weird and the gun play it off. Half the time you have no idea where youre getting shot at. For people who like fast games and a lot of action stay away. I didn't play it enough to dive to deep because I got to bored after 2 games.
"Some developers really need to rethink their development skills. 

And some gamers need to reconsider their ideas about entertainment."
"game was great though ICO ruined it, and now it wont even start wit hthe new hired guns update, fucks sake devs."
I'd rather deal with cheaters than Easy AntiCheat
I only want this game for Star Wars Galactic Conquest but the Squad devs keep breaking it. I download it for free whenever its on a free weekend only for them to have broken it. I'd give my money in a heartbeat if they stopped messing with people wanting to mod the game but they seem to have a prerogative against enjoying the game in ways that aren't their vanilla experience. The day that changes I will gladly recommend this game and buy it as the gameplay is fun and I want nothing more than to play Galactic Conquest.
Meh..
"So it's almost 4 years since I did first try this game and they're just unable to fix the ""No Audio"" bug, literally no other of my almost 500 games has this problem. They also don't really give a **** about people who have that problem, just take a look at the 41 pages of peoples with the same problem in the discusions."
I typed a more detailed review but there was a problem posting it.
How are the devs able to break every mod with every update is beyond me.
"The setting ""Disable weapon model blur"" does not unblur the weapon model."
"joined a game, played for 30 minutes and all I did was lay in the dirt"
Most boring game i have ever played
"Ko da je Vulin optimizovao igricu, sram vas bilo, moram sve na very low da stavim pa mi grafika u igrici izgleda ko Roblox, umesto smoke granate vidim krupne bijele piksele! Platio sve uredno i ovako mi vracate, nije mi mater kupla racunar da bi ja na 30fps-a igro, bruka i sramota developeru, bolje nadji drugi poso Alahi mi!"
this game is so bad i cant even call a retard a retard
"This game is so badly optimized, you can't even get the menu to run smooth enough on powerful hardware to even start a game. I managed to get the settings all down to low and still ran like I was trying to play on an Intel GPU and not a high-end 4000 series nVidia GPU. What an amazing feat."
"SO FAR 17 HRS OF PLAYING,AND  CANT FIGURE IT OUT,TOO COMPLICATED,AND NOW CANT GET REFUND"
"good game, horrible updating system. waited 1 hour to steam repatch the entire game for a 2 gnupdate, then it started reinstallig. i lost it. BUT THEN it said missing download files and restarted everyrthing."
game runs like its on a toaster
was fun in the old days. now its just overdone with the combat update.
"It's alright, and even with it being 50% off at 44$ its not great. Battlefield 3 looked and played smoother and that was 13 years ago. The realism is alright I guess

   lil update after playing a little longer. This game badly suffers from big map syndrome. It has these massive maps, but unless the games are going be 200v200 its incredibly boring, the max is 50v50, IF everyone stays but most of the times the games dwindle down to 20v20 which makes the massive maps even more brutal to deal with.  After numerous games im lucky to get 3 kills. Simply because i can't find annnyone!! This game would be 10x funner and more team based if everyone was forced to be closer together.

  I joined 1 map that was modded i believe, it was like smaller islands, sorta looked like Saipan or Guadalcanal or something but that map was actually fun because the fights were condensed. you had your team around you, it was sick. It desperately needs smaller maps. Couldn't find that map again, sad face. 

  The gun movement needs to be toned down. I've been to a range and handled these weapons before! And the movement is not what i should be and I'm not even a seasoned pro!! When your guy goes to shoulder his weapon he acts like its 20lbs. or everytime you take a step while aiming your guy moves the weapon an insaaane amount. Too much, these are trained professionals, not some toddler trying to fire an M16. 

The choppers have trassshhh door guns too. For some reason the Americans have a 7.62 machine gun on the doors?  

There's nothing to grind for either, no levels, no skins, no medals, literally nothing. 

this game is caked up with ""realistic features"" that are more so over exaggerations. Reduce the maps size by 50%, focus on stability, reduce gun sway while aiming, and sway while moving and aiming. Bring faster spawning for more combat. 87 seconds to respawn is crazy especially with the size of the maps. Even if it was instant, it would still take me 3-5mins to get back to where i was.

Final take, this game is good but not over 30$"
"Four years after release, the game is still unstable and poorly-optimized.  Game crashes and then you have to rejoin the server queue from the back of the line.  Then the queue is broken and you stay at 2/3 for five minutes until you realize it's broken and you have to rejoin AGAIN from the back of the line, which has now grown to 8 people.  Updates to the lighting graphics have everything shimmering and twinkling like a Christmas tree, which detracts from the also poorly-implemented muzzle flash mechanic (because EVERYTHING is flashing...).  Audio bugs mildly deafen you nearly every match with random vehicle and HMG gunfire inside your eardrums.  People still routinely phase through the map.  Vehicle physics are clunky at the best of times.  The game is extremely slow or completely fails to put markers over teammates much of the time, which was not always a problem in the past.  Effort and money spent adding emotes would have been better spent actually fixing bugs and improving the game."
"The game is alright, but the gunplay and mechanics just feel off compared to similar shooters. Everything about the gunplay feels sluggish compared to titles like ArmA and Tarkov."
"""I HAD MY CONTROLLER PLUGGED IN NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"""
"I've been a long-time fan of ""Squad"" and truly appreciate the attention to detail and realism you've infused into the game. The commitment to creating immersive environments and strategic gameplay is impressive, making it one of the most engaging tactical shooters out there.

However, as a Muslim, I’d like to bring up a concern that I believe could improve the inclusivity and respectfulness of the game’s design. In some maps Like Fallujah, Mutah and Al Basrah, mosques are used as active flag points where battles occur, leading players to engage in combat inside or near mosques. In Islam, mosques are sacred places of worship, deeply significant to Muslims globally. Using them as combat zones, where shooting takes place in or around these revered sites, may be viewed as disrespectful to the religious and cultural values they embody.

Similarly, I’ve noticed that some maps feature churches, and I believe that all religious sites, regardless of their faith, should be treated with respect and sensitivity.

I kindly request that mosques and other religious buildings be removed from active flag zones in future updates. Perhaps they could be replaced with neutral structures like compounds or buildings, which would maintain the realism of the maps without compromising the respect for religious significance.

I understand this may not have been intentional, and I trust that the development team values feedback from players of all backgrounds. Making this adjustment could ensure the game remains inclusive and respectful to all players while continuing to deliver the top-notch tactical experience that ""Squad"" is known for."
"Game is amazing, fun, and most probably the best game in its genre. However, the community is as awful as it can be, racism is rampant with the N word being thrown almost every game, along with the occasional IsIs music and the ""Allah w akbar"" callouts; even if they're not insurgents. Even some bullying occurs, one guy I found in a few lobbies had an obvious lisp, and other players would start mimicking him. Gotta respect the guy for ignoring them though.

The fact that it's a game where you have to communicate and do what your SL tells you to do (otherwise you will be kicked from the squad) is both a good and a bad thing. I like the fact that you need to communicate, but hate the fact the people you're communicating with are most probably just a bunch of edgy teens.

Again, I love the game, hate the community.
I recommend you buy it if you have friends to play with, otherwise, stay away. In my case, I don't have friends to play this game with, so it's thumb down."
"My PC far exceeds the recommended specs, yet I'm stuck at only 40 frames. This game seriously needs performance improvements!"
community is ass. ruins the entire game.
"Hardest game i have ever tried.
it needs for real friends not by random"
I have over 1100 hours in this game. I am so disappointed that they ruined the shooting mechanics in the game.  since the updates I have completely stopped playing.  I tired once to come back played about 15 mins but the mechanics are so bad its unplayable.
"WE NEED OPTİMİZATİON!!!!   MAJOR SQUAD V9.0 UPDATE ONLY FOR OPTİMİZATİON, PLS OFFWORLD PLS"
"If I could get a refund for the game I would. I purchased the game because it was a nice, coordination based game with transferable aiming skills. they changed the aiming and I didn't know about it till after my purchase. I really tried to love it but damn is the aiming damn near impossible to get used to. I play tarkov, ready or not, hell let loose, and a bunch of other games in that vein... skills from those games do not transfer over.  Save your money if you play other shooters. if this is going to be your career shooter have at it."
make sure you got a nice pc
"Community for this game is terrible. IT REQUIRES COMMUNICATION however players rarely want to play as a team. 
Too many people will pick US Marines but have NO IDEA HOW TO PLAY ARMOUR. There is no penalty for going lone wolf besides screwing over your team."
"This game is not bad, some aspects are greatly done, especially concerning realism. But it's kinda janky and boring sometimes. I don't mind about walking too much to where the action is, but the maps can look freaking awful sometimes and absolutely devoid of life. It just can't convince me enough, I pass."
Melle
Too little frames and too many game breaking bugs. It gets worse each update.
WHY IS THE MENU MUSIC NOT AFFECTED BY THE MUSIC VOLUME OPTION IN THE SETTINGS I HAVE BEEN DEAFENED BY THIS TRASH WHILST TRYING TO FIND THE MUTE BUTTON
the game keeps crashing and doesn't tell me why
"The recent changes to infantry play have made the game unfun. I don't find it ""tactical"" to sit in corners the whole game. Squad had a great game with good mechanics and they ruined it and now nobody wants to play."
"I used to play Project Reality so I grabbed this a few years ago. Played a little but the game was nowhere near finished and bare of content so decided to come back some other time.

Fast forward to now where I open this abomination and experience the lag of all lag in the menu. It appears despite being at it for years, the cretinous bunch at  'Offworld Franchise' who produce this game cannot (are unwilling to) optimise it. For the record, I'm running a Ryzen 5600x and an RTX 3070 (drivers up to date) and this game is COMPLETELY unplayable. 

Considering paying money for this scam product? Run like hell because unless you have a very niche, singlecore CPU, you can't play it."
"its simply not fun, not at all."
Shit is ass do not buy unless you want to waste 50 bucks.
the game runs shit in cold water and the devs dont seem to give much of a fck
"Meh, I rather play Minecraft w/ world war mod instead"
ICO is just fucking ass this game is unplayable
"trying to rebind the emote button so i don't accidentally press it during combat, bind it to my left mouse click and now I can't click any menu in game and I'm unable to change the setting because my character is just constantly waving. 

Exciting gameplay 10/10
Visual design 10/10
Audio design 10/10
Not having needless fortnite emotes 0/10"
trash i used to love squad havent played in awhile they did some updates now you the game is unplayable. cant  even hold a gun straight even though the are trained to hold weapons
my wife left me
"I love the gameplay, but I simply cannot recommend this game due to the terrible optimization and performance issues it has, even on lowest settings with my legion 5 gaming laptop that cost me $1200 I can't hit a stable 60fps, and aiming with scopes or engaging in any kind of firefight quickly drops that by almost half.

If you wan't to play this game make sure you have a top of the line desktop pc, and that might even not be enough."
"The game was excellent pre ICO but the shooting mechanics are so bad now that it feels like a punishment.

Other changes in the ICO are good, overall, but I can no longer recommend this game as a good and realistic military simulation because of the shooting itself. If this changes, sure, there's nothing like Squad... But be wary of the headache and suffering if you play right now."
no sex
"if you support abstinence, then this is the game for you! Edit: The closer to realism they get, the worse this game gets. It was a good balanced combination between realism vs enjoyability, but they have turned away from enjoyable game-play to appease the virgins of the community."
"I initially couldn't get over how bad the graphics look, but decided to give it another shot and really wanted to get into it. Unfortunately it also seems to be horribly optimised, so despite looking like a ten year old game, even on modern hardware it struggles to run smoothly. The drastic FPS drops at key moments just make it unplayable."
"I used to love this game and played it when I had the time; coming back to it years later I cannot, however, in good conscience recommend it.
Any company changing their privacy policy to the effect of ""we'll collect your <everything> and sell it to Google, Microsoft, and whoever else we damn well please"" without letting me opt out is not worth supporting."
Uses easy anitcheat
"Before the ICO update, game was good. Formerly a Battlefield player and the combat was considerably slower back then, but well balanced where you good push offensively with good success. The new update ruined the game. It was already slow but now it basically encourages staying still and hiding in bushes. Game sucks. Do yourself a favor and refund if you still can but DEFINITELY do not buy this garbage

EDIT: Also, notice how the recently good reviews for this game come from players with very few hours of gameplay. While a lot of the negative reviews come from those with substantially more gameplay. i.e. a lot of the positive reviews don't have the playtime to accurately comment on why this game is so bad now."
"How much do i like fps? life time? as of this review? surely nearing 20,000hrs.  

  im talkin. Doom,  duke nukem, wolfenstien,  im saying Duckhunt, Decent, Half-life's, counter-strike 1.6, CS:Source, TFC,  & Natural selection !   All them Black ops,  modern warfares, unreal tourny, Quakes, PUBG,  Fallouts,  ghost recons, metal gear solids.

I will not play Squad."
"Ah Yes, This is That Game!
The only mil-sim game where you will reach the peak of toxicity, with egoistic game admins and terrible game physics. The only thing you need to know before starting the game is that this game is full of toxics and you will never enjoy playing this game. You can make better use of your money."
"I cannot, after 700+ hours in this game, recommend this game. It's full of baby admins who will ban you if you stand up for yourself against what they determine as ""their definition of war."" if you adhere to the very specific rules of the server you will still get banned because the server admins friends have ""claim on a vehicle."" 

Are you too good at finding radios? banned for ghostin(SOF server)
Are you taking a vehicle that you have claim for but the other squad that ""died first"" is standing around not taking the vic? banned for toxicity.

it's just too much negativity from the server admins to even play this game because they protect their own and OWI doesn't do anything about it. If you've ever reported someone in a game like league of legends you are told if an action is taken against them, OWI does the opposite and doesn't tell you because they don't care.

Do yourself a favor and do not support this game and give it the deserved death because the admins are garbage and OWI doesn't care about their own game. The structure of the game is counter to any form of modern administrative know how and they don't police abusive server admins anyway so it's not even worth playing.

Really solid game potential but lacks in support because of OWI."
"This game is awesome however there are big issues holding this game back. One being its poorly optimized as commented in other reviews. Second is the infantry update. I enjoy the new features it has added to Squad such as the picture in picture scopes and the added suppression. The negatives far outweigh the positives in my opinion 

My main issue is the absurd amount of time it takes to steady your weapon. I understand the need to be ""realistic"" however taking 3-5 business days to ""steady"" my iron sight... it is incredibly excessive. Speaking from experience as current military it takes approximately a second to steady my scope even under stress. Its borderline silly and makes the game frustrating to play as you feel like you are not in control of your character. 

Second complaint is the recoil. I have experience shooting M4's M249s and the M240. Shooting the M4 in game, feels like shooting a 308. Even at close range. Again I understand trying to encourage the player to take his time to take his shot and reward those who are patient but I feel it is completely unrealistic. It further adds to the frustration and feeling that a close quarter gun fight is RNG, flip of the coin luck whether you win or lose that firefight. 

These two aspects of the game I feel are extremely exaggerated and would benefit the game if it were toned down a hair. Remember these are trained soldiers behind the guns of these factions, It should feel like it."
"Toxic player base, just like Squad 44.

Now show me that you aren't in the comments."
"The whole concept behind the game is really very good and I think it makes for a really enjoyable experience if you can get it running properly.

I wouldn't really be able to tell you from my own experience since the game is horribly optimized. I have a pretty decent gear that runs all titles without any significant issues, but I couldn't get this thing to run on more than 40 FPS whatever tweak or update I did. Looking around was choppy and felt like my character was underwater due to a barely noticeable mouse lag. With that, I just couldn't get into the experience as I'd wanted to.

Finally, the game stopped loading completely after I installed the latest graphics driver. I even trier rerolling it to no avail. In summary, I spent more time tinkering with the settings trying to get this thing to run properly than actually playing it. Looking for a solution I noticed I was not the only one as various forums and blogs are filled with people having issues with running Squad.

If you manage to run it without any of the issues I (and many others) experienced, it should make for a pretty rewarding experience. Unfortunately, there's a decent chance you won't be as lucky."
nah no good
Serious issue. The gunplay feels good in most scenarios. People are funny. The game looks good to. But there is no inflation mechanic. every intense moment is ruined by the fact that my BFFF can't inflate me
horribly optimized.
Learned hit registration was client side and this game has crap spaghetti code for hit detection and servers... makes for a bad FPS unfortunately
You play as an uneducated sixteen year old that never touched a weapon.
Crazy bad optimized game. I don't have the best system but it is above recommended specs and I have 40-50 fps and it drops here and there down to 20 on the lowest settings possible. If you look into some discussions here on steam and other forums you will find that I am by far not the only one and people with very good systems can have problems beyond playability. Sad because the gunplay is the most satisfying one I've ever seen
They should make the game run better. big geh
"This is a great game, but the community is completely awful. If you get banned from a server because you had a disagreement with a full on neck beard admin, there's a good chance you'll be automatically banned from all other servers. If this has happened to you, make sure you report this behavior to the better business bureau for breach of contract."
"As of right now, I can't say I've enjoyed this at all. I've been going between this and Hell Let Loose, and Hell Let Loose is infinitely more fun and rewarding than Squad. I played the game with an understanding of the slower pace and more punishing game mechanics, I developed a understanding of how matches flow, but I have to say I never feel rewarded for my additional patience and focus. 
In Squad, I wouldn't mind the lack of an IFF system so much apart from looking at the map and pointing at someone at 10 meters away, if it wasn't so chaotic and scattered. Not to mention when you do acquire a target, you cannot range-find, and it's a 2 shot kill with the DMRs, so Marksman feels empty as hell, and Sniper does especially due to there being no spotter like in HLL.
I can't relay information all that well and accurately because it's rare that a marksman is a FTL, thus you can't mark a damn thing, so not only is the shooting not fun but there's no passive recon role for you either. If I wanted a 2 shot sniper, I'd rather just go and play battlefield, it feels arcade-like as hell, especially when HLL is 1 shot kill.
Overall, the only thing that ever makes me want to come back to it is that it's modern, but I will take HLL every day of the week, and I wouldn't really care if I never played this again. Sure, the game has its moments, mainly due to the community, but overall, the additional patience and focus required to play this game isn't rewarded very much at all, and I personally wouldn't play this all day like I would Hell Let Loose.
Also, as someone who plays tanks more than anything else, the game-play doesn't feel great for AFVs either, it doesn't feel all that fun, but it's a thrill in HLL, so that's all I have to say."
crashes a lot and if you do not load in quickly you will get timed out
This game stinks

"One of the main thing about the game, is the optimisation. This game has the worst optimisation and game itself is CPU based. Does not matter game is good or unique whatever. If it is not playable, so it is trash. I am quitting unfortunately my fav game (for some time) from today until they fix these issues (they wont).  
(If you you dont have latest technology in your pc just dont buy this game)"
This game somehow manged to be way worse optimized then it was a year ago. My PC is better than what is recommended and it struggles to hit 50 FPS at the lowest settings when a year ago it was easily able to surpass 100 FPS.
"Audio input device keeps on resetting, I have to select every time I play this game. Can't play because of this bug. :steamthumbsdown:"
community is just russians and its all disorganized
"Not only you need a Nasa computer to play this one, keep in mind you most likely will barely get into any close range combat since this game is a run and die simulator. Also, it is very funny to see how my trained soldier needs 10 mins to adjust his aim in order to take a shot, shooting in this game is very broken too. Hate to admit it but the game failed my expectations."
No possibilty to create a group to play with your friends? lol
fucking impossible
"Used to be a good game, now it's not."
"Lets see Toxic SL's in that are friends with or are moderators of Servers ruin the game. 

Got kicked form a server for just saying ""follow me I'm the closest element to the enemy"" as we were attacking the enemy base SO I re joined the server and squad the SL said ""watch this"" and banned me for 7 days. 

Went to the Servers discord ""Elite Gaming Corps"" [ECG] as they said I could appeal the ban, The Admin on their discord ""[EGC] Sleepy"" told me to kick rocks we don't have anyone by that name and the appeal went nowhere....     

So i would not recommend playing this game SL's and Moderators can just ban you for for speaking against their people. Its the worst type of game that only encourages Toxic admin that have full power to not let you play the game."
The game mechanics are super sluggish and make you feel like you are running on a treadmill and shooting a nerf gun.
"Hell Let Loose with modern weapons...
Battlefield with more realism...
Run around slowly through a wheat field looking for enemies for 30 mins then get shot in the head...
Im a tarkov player, and this didn't scratch the gun realism or the adrenaline punch.
Refunded"
Played this up and down over the years. But the developers have no interest in keeping the game optimized and running reliably.
"Unless you have a NASA super computer you can not play the game. Game play is great, but with dips, stutters, and general inconsistent frame rates its a not fun experience."
nah
"Can get pretty boring, its fun when it works, Mic is recommend or you might get kicked!!!!! Poorly optimized!!!!!!!


Also please do not buy this from the Steam store directly thank you, their monopoly on PC gaming is not good for the consumer!!!!!! They heavily censor people in the forums, you can't speak freely out of fear of being banned, I have had a 1 year community ban because of stupid silly bans, they accumulate, and eventually land you a community ban!!!! If you support Steam, you support such censorship!!!"
"game is fucking gay as hell 

literally balances asymmetric warfare to the point the irregulars and insurgents are the best factions in the game

dog shit community that doesnt welcome veterans at all

squeakers and cod players go to squad when they get bored of fuckin cod and battlefield

actual dog shit"
"If you speak a different language in the squad, the rest of the squad kicks you out even though you speak English"

"Takes a very long time to get to the combat, especially with no vehicle, only for you to get clipped 5 seconds upon entering the battlefield having to spend 10 more minutes running back to the combat"
to much russians
"if you like to spawn in, run a for a few minutes, and get 1 shot from some random guy 2k miles away with a scope. Then this game is for you. The previews are all for cinematic purposes. In reality the moment you peak ANY corner you are shot. Lay down and take it slow in some high grass. HA FUNNY. Youll be sniped or some random will run up and kill you before his head even pops over the hill. Feel like suppressing fire? nope youll get 10 shots off and get picked off instantly. The only good thing about this is the experience with your squad, but other than that its no fun at all. just another run and die simulator"

"Honestly pretty bad. Save your money.

To many glitches!

(1) In a tank? After shooting once you can not shoot again, have you leave the vehicle to reload about 50% of the time very annoying especially in combat.
(2) In a tank? Oh hit a tiny bush? Or little lip of the map? Bang! You flipped over or lost all momentum and got launched.
(3) Most maps are just garbage.
(4) Can't really play solo, no communication of command chat most servers.
(5) Ran 1-5 feet? You're character is an asthmatic and can't seem to aim properly.
(6) Reload bug with main weapon is annoying.
List goes on, recent update is not bad, global escalation is the only server you should play honestly."
The game was so good prior to the infantry combat overhaul. Now your soldier has arms like wet noodles and hes never handled a rifle before.. :/  some of the worst weapon handling of any game now. kind of unfortunate.
"Worst ""Realistic"" game ive ever played. The shooting mechanics make no sense. Its like the developer only watched videos on CNN about how weapons work and used that to make the game. Hope i can get a refund, because i wouldn't get the game if they payed me to play it."
The changes to the aiming system feel terrible. If you touch the sprint key it will take 7-10 business days for you to stop wheezing like an asthmatic in a dust cloud while your gun wobbles back and forth like you have pool noodles where your bones should be. I don't think this change has had the intended effect on squad dynamics as people still go lone wolf and refuse to communicate but now every gun fight feels like RNG instead of a question of gun skill or positioning. The group dynamics and game experience when your squad is working together is still some of the best in gaming but the actual play feels so much worse.
", because you are very unlikely to do so"
bad
"It used to be pretty fun game before. Now they have changed the ads rendering and it's pretty much unplayable. In addition to that, they managed to make it even more unoptimised and laggy than it used to be."
crashed my pc while on loading screen
"Game is cool and has tons of potential, only if people weren't so dumb. One thing is having fun on spawn and another thing is being a clown on the battlefield on a server marked as focused/milsim. Commanders not leading their team, sometimes not even having a mic, is just as common as people not following orders or even playing with their squad."
Games fuckin trash and full of fags
toxic
"Poorly optimised, big fps drop. Unplayable"
trash game
its not good game
"Game use to be fun. Current state just makes no sense. Its the slowest animations I have ever seen. It is not even a running sim, its a walking sim.  The mods make it fun but as a base game, it has gone from one of my favorites to worse than battlefield. recoil makes no sense. 9mm is staring at the sky after 2 shots, can't even spray a target point blank. Devs have no idea what realism is, which if I am not mistaken, is what the game took pride in early on. If you want realism, this is not the game for you. If you still get it, download the mods. It fixes some of the problems, not all of them."
"This whole game feels like it used to on a free weekend. Fights are much longer now, yea. Soldiers are shaking more then someone going through withdrawals. Logis are avoided by most players. Not a fan anymore. Used to be my top game."
"They put so much effort into depicting real combat that the end result feels extremely over-exaggerated, turning the entire experience into something frustrating and dull, with memorable occurrences happening very rarely."
Sometimes more realistic isn't better. Spend 20-30 minutes walking or riding to a location just to take a bullet from nowhere. Repeat the process. Realistic? yeah... Fun? No!
"The community in most of the servers is full of the biggest pro airsoft ""i couldve joined the military but i'd punch someone"" community that is not friendly to any new players despite server claims in their titles. There are lots of power hungry people that get a smidge of authority and be complete pretentious a-holes all the time, yet ban/kick people that argue back. I got ran over by a tank and tk'd by two goobers that were close to the server owner in one server and team-killing is okay but when i call them r*tards for running over people with a tank, their ego and feelings get extremely hurt and they banned me for offensive chat. i figured there would be people with actual personalities that want to hop on and have some fun because the game looks more arcade-y than arma but that doesn't seem to be the case in the 2 hours and around 5 servers that i hopped into. 

TL:DR most of the people that play this game don't play for fun and aren't friendly to new people. they must be fun at parties and have great social skills outside their basement."
Bunch of kids that have no idea what they doing. Your teammates always pop you or your buddy cause they don't know how to P.I.D uniforms and weapon systems. No one in the game plays the way it should be. Everyone thinks it's battlefield and run around with their heads up their ass. No one knows shit about combat when it comes to this game. It's ridiculous
"Disappointing ""Realism"" Game, Overpriced. Most hours are from game being idle in the background."
"Racism,Sexim,Putinism,Zeleniskism,Trumpizm,Americanizm,Natoizm,Bricsizm."
i have no idea why i got this fucking trash game
Let's be honest battlefield is still better.
"Squad has been out for eight years and it still has the same audio bugs and so many other problems that it has had since early access. The dev team don't seem to care about the title. Half of the new content they release is just mods that purchase (probably for a pittance) and it takes forever for them to add it into the game. In spite of much I've played Squad I can't recommend it to anyone because it's too frustrating to play most of the time. Very often I'll spend half an hour in a queue to join a server and I'll have to quit because I didn't realize that my headset wasn't on and, despite the fact that you can change your audio output device in the in-game settings, that part of the menu has never actually worked. If you change outputs mid game (like if you accidentally unplug your headset or it dies) Squad will stop outputting to it and if might even crash. The only way to fix this is to restart your game and queue up again. This has been an issue since early access and it's weird that we still have problems like this in a game that is so focused on communication. This is just one of the game-breaking bugs that has been present since launch. Also, an aside, a couple years ago OWI, the developers, sold out to Tencent (The CCP) and they are trying to turn this game into a microtransaction filled pile. They have no ethics and have been to known to fire employees over having the ""wrong"" view. They fired an employee for stating anti-CCP views on social media shortly before they got their investment from Tencent. We all just assumed that was their new glorious leaders doing."
This game gave me aids
"Summary_ 
At it's core, in a server that isn't full of nit-wits, it can be a fun example of large scale mil-sim but it's plagued with poor performance and questionable design decisions which disrupt the flow of gameplay.

Design_
A large scale tactical game, sitting inbetween Battlefield and Arma 3, leaning towards the latter, unfortunately it seems to have inherited some of the jank from that as well with vehicle handling, movement systems and just how sluggish everything feels, I can usually excuse the slow pace as it it's designed towards a more methodical play-style, however the developers have consistently been making it worse over time, particularly highlighted with the Infantry Combat Overhaul which strives for realism but just makes infantry a chore. It attempts to execute a realistic feel for things but fails to create an identity for itself as it forgets at it's core that it is a game and is supposed to be enjoyed.

Maps are relatively uninteresting, feeling like plastic sandboxes with a veneer of theme. again reminicent of early arma games.

Technology_
It's plagued with the usual mid-life UE4 game troubles, shader & traversal stutter, some really awful Temporal anti-aliasing, which is somehow not remedied with DLSS, suggesting their art doesn't lend itself to it, distracting Ambient Occlusion artifacts, almost identical to that of Ground Branch (which coincidentally is on the same engine branch). Frame-rate dips into the high 30s considerably on high-end hardware, particularly while using PIP scopes, which was a strange late addition, given the pre-existing performance issues."
"I've enjoyed SQUAD when I've had the itch for it but after ICO, I find myself uninstalling this game time and time again.

ICO was meant to be an overhaul to the infantry mechanics to make things more ""realistic"" and to encourage cooperation between players and reduce the whole ""lone wolf"" mentality that was initially in SQUAD. Problem is they've over compensated, and now the weapon sway makes combat feel absolutely frustrating more than it is enjoyable. ICO is dog ass and until they update ICO again to adjust the sway values I'm not reinstalling this game. Arma 3 has more better gunplay then this update and that's saying something for how absolutely jank that game is."
"Got a new PC, installed Squad and now the game is stuck in offline mode. Discord mods/support don't help and just lock your threads, steam community is no help. Game support is literally ZERO.  fuck OWI."
"Its painful to write this because i really want to write something positive and reccomend to friends.... but i can't.   To start with the good,  i think the overall war aesthetic with the different factions, mod support, overall gameplay of pushing objectives instead of running for kills is definitely there. I enjoy playing this waking up in the mornings by doing Logi runs to start, and then get into combat later, there definitely is a pull to play this game and have enjoyed some experiences along the way. Plus there is no push to pay Microtransactions which is nice too. And lastly i really enjoy the maps!                                  Now time for the bad. There are more bugs in the game than an old abandoned warehouse. You can't shoot through open holes even when the barrel is sticking through the hole in the wall and theres plenty of space. I had to download a VPN just to stay in a lobby for more than 5 minutes at a time because of Server Closed Connection error. No VPN= no gameplay, i see it happen to everyone i play with. Performance wise isn't terrible but definitely needs a touch up lag wise and de sync wise. You get stuck on random objects all the time like trees or even rocks. There's quite a bit more.    I want to see the game improve, but until i can see positive action, i cannot reccomend the game, i only say all this with respect and the desire to see the game get better."
Asking me to write a whole ass review just to give a game a thumbs down is asinine.
crashed my game after i set defaults graphics settings
I’d like  by to refund this game
shit
"Fat neck beards with no life larp either as Super commandos or wanna be jihadist, 10/10 they never fired a gun irl."
pretty poorly optimized
"60 hours in and still have no idea what i'm doing.
I want to get into a car. I get kicked out of it.
I want to enter a tank. I get kicked out or can't enter at all.
I want to play with tanks and stuff. Nope. 
Teammates helps out and pick me up with truck? Nope, get run over.
I want to play specific role. Nope, someone else picked that.
There are zombies server, which is cool idea. No one plays it.
Modded servers, great. Hard to find them.

I get it that the game is realistic and all but really limiting to me. 60 hours in and i still haven't played with a tank for example. 90% of the teammates i had would just f with me.
I bet it's great game, just not for everyone."
"I don't understand the plot of this game.By the way, this game lacks LGBT representation, has few Black characters, and insufficient diversity among women, which is why I gave it a negative review."
worst aiming system EVER. even if your just standing there its like you have noodle arms
"ICO is horrible, weapons handling is awful."
"-Very poor optimization

-Absurd weapon sway/recoil control

-Suppression system is wildly untuned

-Aim point seems to be from chest level rather than head level, making seemingly “clear” shots hit geometry

-Unless facing off against Irregulars or Insurgents, nearly impossible to identify enemies

-Server-hop and roll the dice, match quality is atrocious across the board

-Overwhelming majority of “community” who stayed after the ICO Update are vile and toxic; an astonishing amount of lackadaisical immaturity and stolen valor keyboard warriors who think their knowledge of a game makes them veterans. Laughable."
bad performance
Game is fun but no one new wants to learn how to play the game right and 80% of the time i end up with teams that dont secure points and just play like it's cod and push from one direction
It's a little bit difficult to see enemies... and alot of the time you'll end up killing friendlies
"stupid game, i hate you so much off world, some servers dumb asf and you're not even making sure of that"
Not my cup of biscuit.
"I only have close to 19 hours in the game so I only scratched the surface of the game but from what I experienced until now I would not recommend the game due to the following reasons:

- Movement, shooting, driving... basically everything has some jank to it
- Hitboxes of structures can be weird and not what they should be
- Insane levels of suppression
- Gunplay just feels terrible"
Bunch of military reject and dishonorable discharges that have nothing better to do than bully each other.
very cool
"Squad has huge potential, but its $50 price tag is too high. This is a game that feels like it is in late alpha stage. The bugs are numerous, and the game itself feels unpolished and unfinished. I do usually have fun on this game, but I would only recommend buying it on a sale. Once it is more polished it will be a 10/10"
Some of the worst devs ever.
terrible ui not very well optimized
nah
honestly this game just isnt for me
"Still randomly crashes after 4 years. One second you're playing on a full server, the next half the server disappears, just like your childhood hopes and dreams (just faster)!"
"Game is not playable at all.

Server Browser and ""Find A Match"" do not work on this game. Haven't been able to play for months now. You literally can only play the tutorials. Game is completely useless now."
laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaag
Was good at one point in time
"FOV is tied to resolution/aspect ratio which means triple screen users like myself cannot play whatsoever. 120 fov looks more like 30. Ridiculous oversight in 2024, until this game becomes playable, im reviewing negatively as they have not considered anyone who uses more than 1 screen."
"Toxic community and shitty servers, everyone acts braindead and overly rude.

edit: played some more, game is just boring, previous problems still stand"
very slow and bugs
"i dont like to be forced to talk to people exp  when they take this game too srsly,  im just playing the game not tryn learn it or be great at it. i just wanna have fun solo but in multiplayer"
"Returned after a year away to check out the new gunplay mechanics. Feels unplayable now, takes 4 working days to ADS and when you eventually get there, the sight shakes like a geriatric granny. No hate but it feels like an L for me. At least I got my moneys worth before the update I guess."
"Не затянуло, зря купил"

There are too many toxic players.
fuh nooooh
"I have tried and tried and tried. I saw all the reviews when ICO first dropped and I was adamant I was going to give it a good honest go. I felt like this game was thriving, especially in the Oceania servers. My mates and I had some of the best gaming experiences we've ever had playing pre-ICO squad going all the way back to the early alpha versions 2015/2016 when there weren't even vehicles in the game yet.
I love this game, and I want to still love this game, but I can't help but be continually frustrated and then disappointing with the ICO game play man... It just ruins the experience for me. And clearly has ruined it for a lot of people.

All good things come to an end I suppose, but It felt like Squad had just lifted off. And it could've gotten so much better. Once the game came out of Beta in 2020 and 1.0 was live it felt like it was really starting to take off. There were even competitive games that we played in. And it felt good that I could recognise players from years ago that were still here supporting the game.

However I feel as though for me, (maybe some other people feel the same but ultimately I can only speak for myself) it has been very difficult to adapt to the play style. The only reason I still play is to join the modded servers that take it back to as close as it can be to pre-ICO, and when they're empty, I don't even bother anymore."
The game has turned into nothing but locked Squads and SLs kicking people from Squads. The recoil and ads speed that can be timed with a calendar have made this game feel like im always playing drunk. Maybe one day they will revert back to its original glory.
"Parkinsons + FPS = Squad

Dogsh@t, not worth 50 Euro. Your experience is wholy based on who you play with and since update 7 its been downspiraling into bullsh@t. No teamwork, no strategies.... exactly what the game is based on and selling you. First 300 hours you wont know what you are doing or where you are getting shot at unless you have someone to guide you like in the past with the veterans leading the way for the Newbies. Now its the blind leading the blind kind of senario. OWI prioritises new players over veterans, cant sell the game twice, ofcouse they would if they could.

Also, if your computer aint top notch... dont expect more than 12 fps and 1 if artillery is on its way, even if you play on lowest settings.

Dont expect much from OWI either, promising new content and making roadmaps only to scrap them and sell you skins and emotes. Whats next? Battlepass? Just fix the game...

Was the best game out there, i play for the nostalgia it gives me, but holy sh@t  did OWI destroy the game."
worst game ever
Some how the devs went backwards they had a good game then messed it up. I enjoyed playing this game at one point but it seem just like bigger company they cant help but break good games.
Its a combination of the graphics and movement of counter strike the shooting of call of duty and maps of Battlefield. I paid 30USD and I think that was to much.
Just play the mods. The game developers made the soldiers have the aim of inflatable tube dancers from a car dealership. Sure the majority of reviews are positive but those people are using mods. ICO needs to go
"Not sure what happen to this game, but it went from gold to shit. 330 hours in the game and they somehow made visibility worse, the gunplay unrealistic and stupid, might as well remove the stamina bar, it does nothing but a 2 second sprint for a 2 minute recovering timer, you can't see ANYTHING when you're being ""suppressed"", which just makes gunfights absolutely horseshit. For the veteran players out there, I feel bad for what the devs did to you. They don't care and will never care for you. They will try to simulate something so damn hard that it will absolutely ruin the entire experience for you. I understand why OperatorDrewski stopped playing this game."

"Until name tags reliably show on friendlies when you aim at them, I wouldn't bother with this. Half the time they do, half they don't. Why even have it in the game? You trust the name tag, and hold fire. You don't see a name tag, you fire, and it's a friendly. They worked perfectly before all the DLSS blurry bullshit was added."
"I never leave reviews... this is my first review. 

This game is a complete piece of horse____.

This game used to be the best thing ever but these updates to make it more realistic completely killed the game for me. I pull more hairs trying to get my character to actually fire his weapon than anything else. 

DO NOT BUY... this is from a former hardcore fan."
"Have 800+ hrs into the game, was fun at start, ICO was great but in the last few weeks/months the game is broken beyond repair, I do not know how they roll out updates that break the game even more with each rollout.

Bugs of all kinds, visual, sound, gamebreaking bugs like glitchy respawns, invicible tanks, broken vehics that do not reaload, broken guns, broken anti tank that does not reload, glitchy ragdolls, helis being dead in the sky, crashes, etc etc. Really dissapointed, I gave it time for the devs to fix, but enough time wasted for a broken game."
This game is great but the community completely ruins it. Everyone is completely toxic and horrible. You should honestly just play arma
buggy and unpolished. Shouldnt cost as much as it did
add swedish military
"This game was once the best semi-realistic shooter on the market. Then OWI decided to burn it all down. From the most controversial change, ""Infantry Combat Overhaul"", to long standing technical bugs (grass not rendering at distance, vehicles vibrating, players' bodies glitching through walls, etc.), and a not so new problem I am encountering again; I can't even select an audio output device. This was an issue when I first downloaded Squad, SEVEN YEARS AGO. 

TLDR: Lazy developers are not fixing issues reported by the community for years and consistently push out fixes based on whims."
you will not be able to run this game
gunplay feels trash
"Not really a good game, is nearly impossible to find a decent server. Usually the commanders are idiots along with the rest of the team. The graphics arent that great for 2024. Its nearly impossible to tell friend from foe so you get team killed over and over. Then you have to wait forever to spawn 5 mins worth of running from where you were at. Arma or Hell Let Loose are much better in my opinion. Really cant recommend for full price, maybe for a steep discount it could be worth a try"
"Not really beginner friendly, i dont know if im just unlucky with the servers i joined. but the moment i joined, the voice chat was just a shouting match between what feels like everyone in the server. i die at some point, so i respawn as i take a long walk back to join my squad, all the way i hear squad lead and other members arguing and yelling. after 10 mins of walking i finally get back to the point where squad was telling everyone to go to, i turn a corner and first person i ever see since the 10 mins ive been walking is my teamate named DutchDave, whom i get startled by because his unifrom looked differently colored to me so i shoot him. it dosent kill him but ofcs apologize. he however proceeds to still call me a Fucking idiot, to which i tell him to calm down and that im new to the game and didnt hear him announce himself, and i guess that hurt his fragile af ego and his very mature response is ofcs to unload his whole mag into me whilst insulting me the entire time, then he drags my body and keeps insulting me and that dosent stop until he is finally killed by an enemy. after that its more shouting and insulting between everyone feels like im playing fucking COD from XBOX era instead of a tactical shooter. 

all this happened in the first game that i joined. and im sorry but despite it looking like complexly fun game where communication is vital, i absolutely do not want to be part of the communication when so far from what ive experienced has been just immature self righteous pricks that will not only kill you and insult the fuck out of u for ur inexperience, they will also be shouting over each other as if whoever can reach the highest decibels is gonna be crowned the emperor of all mankind. 

im sure that what ive experienced is probably not what the average experience for a beginner is like, and i still want to have faith that most people are friendly. but from my experience it completely killed any sort of need or want to play this game again anytime soon."
"Game's dead already. got thrown into a server with myself and one other gamer, screwed around until I died of fall damage.

I also couldn't get the game working in 4k, not without AMD FSR enabled. Without FSR it doesn't seem to fit the screen properly."
"I used to like this game and loved playing it all-day-long on the weekends but, the infantry overhaul ruined the game. You can barely aim your weapon and for some reason it's harder to spot OPFOR. This game is jank now. I do not recommend this game to anyone anymore. The Devs screwed up big time, they need to fix this game."
"ICO update ruined this game.  They wanted to ""slow down"" firefights and get rid of ""lone wolfing"", but they accomplished that by destroying gun play and punishing infantry.  .50cal round flew within 50m of you? Enjoy being legally blind with suppression for 30 seconds!  Enemy player cannot hit a shot from 25m away? Forget trying to shoot back, your screen is aimpunched from every single bullet that even comes near you and you can't fight back!  Hear enemy armor rolling down the road towards you? Well pull out your HAT and wait 2 minutes for your weapon sway to go away!

The game felt great before.  Good players crushed bad players.  Now every soldier has Parkinson's and has also never shot a rifle in their life.

But don't worry, OWI is working on some more WACKY and FUN emotes and weapon skins!"
Badly optimized game
"so baaaaad, pinoy faction needed"
Used to be such a good game. Completely ruined by the ICO update. Not to mention most people suck at being SL's and teammates rarely talk anymore... Uninstalled. Don't recommend buying. There are better games out there.
Very fun game would not recommend at the moment because of the removal of the global escalation mod which made the game where it should have been save your money unless you wouldn't mind playing on the regular boring servers with shit mechanics!
1/10. By far the worst game I have purchased on steam. Dont buy this game!
Not enough slide cancelling and exo jumps
Give me my reflex back!!! and Community ban list is heinous and L. I'd rather a bot over chuddly meeting his ban quota. Good community
game is just shit now
Star Wars mod still broken.
"With just under 1k hours in Squad, most of that coming from around 2020-2021, I've not been up to date with anything Squad related since, so maybe this game isn't meant for players like me anymore but here is my review, based upon just how much time I spent on this game, learning it deeply and playing at a level where I was comfortable, to playing it recently:

I recently reinstalled to play with a friend, and I was not prepared for the shock that I have come to learn is the 'ICO' update. 

Now I totally understand that I've not been up to date with it, and from what I used to be, I am a filthy casual in comparison to what I used to be... but the gun play in this game feels as if you gave a toddler a gun whilst balancing on a water bed. The AMOUNT of sway that a ""soldier"" has to his gun even after moving barely 30% of the screen is incredible. I do not fully understand why it feels like the noodle arms feels like it has been turned up to 110%, nor the scopes being at all possible to look down and accurately hit something when it feels like my character is holding a gun too big for him to hold.

Squad is a team game, I totally get that, and I was under the impression that it already was before this ICO update. Excellent players were able to turn the tides, but excellent tactics would trump those players. Positioning > Aim, right? I just feel as if this update just completely takes away from player skill and prefers players to just spam left click at the sight of any enemy rather than take precise slow shots. They can't fire back if their suppressed screen is shaking about.

I didn't last longer than a full game as it was just straight up: Not fun. Ultimately that is what it has come down to. It's not fun to sit there waiting for weapon sway to calm before I can even begin taking shots at someone. It's not fun to lose a hipfire ""50/50"" because they shot first (and missed), but because I'm suppressed I have to adjust -like hell- for my weapon swaying off to the side. I'm already at a disadvantage cause they shot first, and yet I'm punished more because they can't kill me within the first 1-2 bullets.

It is just a shame, I loved what Squad was, not what it is now. Don't think I'll ever install it again with how it plays now. it is still king for teamwork/team play and overall using communication to beat the enemy team, but in terms of gun play, that for me is completely ruined and gone."
Bugged unoptimased arma clone
Would say bad game has no sex but im always getting but fucked any way so its just a bad game
i hate my life
"your either smacking everybody, or your getting destroyed by somebody that you cant see, there's no in between.  Also it should not take a trained solider a minute to aim after running for 30 seconds, it makes sense for your aim to be a bit worse, but it feels really overdone."
"This game is a laggy mess. They need to optimize this game. If you have medium tier hardware, do not buy."
"Terrible for the modding community. Two of the best mods have been removed forever for whatever reason. Global escalation, and galactic contention were amazing reasons to buy this game."
Runs like shit
boring
"The Removal of GE mod killed the game. Community should know, that publishers from offworld interactive realised that a bunch of fans can make a mod that is more popular and overall better than their vanilla, especially since the infantry combat overhaul completely ruined it. Since the removal of GE and new combat overhaul game was made completely unplayable. 

Rest in Peace old Squad, we shall remember you..."
"Squad made numerous changes to its combat system in an attempt to create longer firefights and more engaging combat. They instead have created a combat experience that is 90 percent waiting for a guy to come to you because nobody wants to push when your soldier is a noodle armed bitch. So they have created ""longer"" gunfights in the sense that you will stare at an area for 20 minutes waiting for an enemy. However, that makes you one lucky son of a bitch because that means your squad is properly coordinating. In reality, 9 out of 10 games you will play will be with squadmates with no mics, SLs with no brains, and an experience that feels more like a sluggish knockoff of battlefield. The devs are so high up their ass with these 5 dollar skin cosmetics that they can't add basic QOL features like a slider for the sensitivity when using your binoculars, or making it so the game isn't an unoptimized mess. The asinine push to drop the ICO on the community has driven many veteran players out of the game leaving inexperienced/new players to take up SL(I'm glad new players are getting into the game but its a role requiring a good understanding of the game). Where as before the ICO you had veteran players, squad leading and creating an example for newer players to learn from, now you have SLs that are lost in the middle of nowhere creating FOBs with no effect on the game. Lets be clear here, the majority of the fun you will have in this game is having a COMPETENT SL and team. When you don't have those you are left with an asthmatic running simulator where you can shoot at some dudes. Now, the greatness that is the modding community for this game created a little mod called Global Escalation and it happened to remedy the problems with the combat. Things like pushes suddenly started happening and people were more inclined to communicate with one another due to the deadlier nature of gunfights. That's gone now. Either they or OWI fucked up and now its been replaced with a buggy, shitty, pale imitation. There are a thousand more reasons as to why this game is shit but that would take too much time. DO NOT BUY"
"I have over 400 hours on this game and love it, but they ruined it with the Combat Overhaul. The objective being realism, it was decided to make weapon sway and other forms of handling harder to actually shoot people. creating longer and more team oriented firefights. The problem is, no one I have ever seen use a firearm has had noodle arms this bad as the person holding these guns in game. With the removal of the Global Escalation Mod, the game is not too hard to play, but simply not fun. I recommend spending your money elsewhere."
Not that great. Not that terrible.
run for miles get shot in back of head run back die again
"Squad started off in Early Access a first person shooter where your ability to shoot was the least important thing you could bring to the team. Over the years OWI built upon this by adding systems that enforced both team-level strategic gameplay, and squad-level tactical gameplay, through the use of a logistics system, vehicle spawning systems, repair and rearm costs, and even the primary spawning mechanic required teamwork through having only one player be able to place spawns per squad. You really needed to work together as a team in order to even function so it attracted a certain type of player. A solo shooter could still have fun with the arcadey gunplay but would have very little effect on the overall team dynamic, the guy volunteering to do a logi run or build a HAB was the reason your team won and had fun. This was the balance originally advertised by OWI as a midpoint between mil-sim games such as Arma, and arcade shooters such as Battlefield. Unfortunately in the past couple years OWI have done away with that balance so the game now resembles any other generic arcade shooter. It's still a fun game, and the mods are some of the most impressive I've seen in any FPS game, but the community has all but disappeared and are unlikely to purchase a Squad 2 in future. Unfortunately the game was entirely reliant upon experienced players doing all the heavy lifting while new players learned but you'll struggle to find any servers now with people willing to do that as they have all left in protest over OWI's actions. This is OWI's only successful IP to date so I understand why they've decided to make the game more appealing to a wider audience but this was not what was promised to Early Access players and frankly if I wanted to play a Battlefield clone there's better examples."
"When I enter the game, it does not work. I do not know what the problem is, and a black screen appears"
Infantry Overhaul ruined this game
Fix the visibility bro i'm tired of shooting at pixels...
"As someone who persistently tries to enjoy tactical shooters, I found Squad to be a very frustrating game. I love the pieces but not the sum of the parts.  If Squad was a Lego set, I’d rather use the bricks to build something else. 

Squad is a great idea. It takes the boring organisational parts of Arma 3 out of the way so you can spend more time playing the game and enjoying the action. The game play is supported by loads of fun weapons, vehicles and factions. Diverse maps, solid movement mechanics and a good radio system which I found easy to use (once I had changed my keybinds to match Arma). The developers are continually supporting and updating the game, long time players would butt in here and highlight the ups and downs of the update history but at least the developers are there trying to improve the game. Or at the very least keep it fresh. It’s all sounding good so far, so where does my frustrating come from?

Firstly, one minor frustration that inconvenienced me on 80% of the sessions I played was that I could not create a party/group in the main menu and queue with my friends. I was trying to join servers in a group of 4-9 people for most of my playing time and it always added a layer of hassle that we couldn’t queue up together in some sort of quick play list. 

However, the main drive of my frustrations comes from something outside of the developer’s control. Squad relies heavily on those around you, meaning your fellow players. Offworld Industries provides the tools, but the players create the game. And unfortunately, when I played solo I found a Mos Eisley motley crew of whinge bags, poor leaders, unhelpful team players and worst of all the gormless. I myself was one of the latter gormless players who more than anything got in the way of those around me. I’ll share two anecdotes about different experiences I had in the game to highlight the different player types I’ve critically identified.

“I had solo queued into a fresh lobby and joined a random public squad. We headed out fairly normally from HQ but no one wanted to take on the fireteam lead slots. That was the fine until our squad leader decided to not immediately go for the OBJ and instead take a more logistical approach by securing a flank. At this point applications for fireteam lead were flying in and many voices of great wisdom tried to persuade the squad lead to change his course of action. They simply demanded he did what they wanted without explaining why their course of action was better, the squad lead had admitted his inexperience earlier in the game but did not relent to their demands. At this point 2/3 of the squad abandoned the plan and went off doing their own thing for the rest of the game. I remained with the squad leader and pointlessly followed him around for 45 minutes. We achieved nothing. But equally our other squad mates who went off on their own to the OBJ did not work together so they also achieved absolutely nothing.”

“I decided to give the squad leader role a try as I was playing with a full infantry section (i.e 9 people) from my arma group. Upon joining I tried to get some advice from the higher command structure about what my squad should do. This was met with a long silence and then the beginning of a new conversation. I would continue to seek guidance throughout the game. But I figured no one else had time to hold my hand through the game so I decided to make some plans for us… and what a shit show that became. We got squad wiped many times in a row, all of which were the fault of myself and the extreme expertise shown by our opponents. If I was Neville Chamberlain, I was facing down Napolean, Genghis Khan, Caesar and Saladin. We lost every game that night and it was the last time many of us tried to play Squad”

A skill issue. That’s my frustration with Squad, I’m simply not good at it. But I’m also not willing to get good at it in the current community landscape, so is the answer that I shouldn’t play? At the moment, the answer is yes. There’s plenty of YouTube guides out there and if I ever want to recreate my COVID years at university I know Squad is there for me. At the start of this “review” which has turned into the mother of all rambles, I praised Squad for taking the organisational burden away from Arma 3. However, that is also why I’ve quit Squad and I have 2,000 hours on Arma 3. In Arma players are put into roles that suit them and are shown how to do different things in the game by a human being, not a YouTube video. Arma 3 is a proficient noob academy that encourages new players to learn and get better. Squad takes a Spartan approach to learning, you either do it right or you die. 

To conclude Squad could be fantastic and I think it’s worth trying. But only if you don’t mind independently learning a game with a fair amount of nuance and rules of thumb. If you can go with the flow and appreciate the good games when they come to you and spend your time listening to other people recount that one incredible game. Then Squad is worth a purchase because the pieces made by Offworld are really good. Good luck and remember I’ve only got 17 badly played hours and a whole host of Arma 3 nostalgia."
"Stupid game studio with stupid decisions, managed by clowns.

Banned the best Mod available called ""The Real Invasion"". 

They made the worst game ever, people took it up themselves to create mods to create better gameplay and experience and they banned it. 

Tell me how can 2 kids can do a better job than a game studio. 

Absolute shitshow, don't buy this game. 

They even admitted they shut it down because it was competing with their servers lol."
This is just torture.
"I find the Game to get Boring way too fast.
The nearly 60$ Price Tag is no where near reasonable nor justifiable."
After the 8.0 update only urban maps are fun now
"unenjoyable game, the squad videos never show what its truly like.
hard to find good squad leads, half the time a squad leader is gonna have you building a HAB or driving vehicles and never detail that before you start heading out and other groups are locked.
not an enjoyable game if you dont feel like building a HAB 20 miles behind lines and sitting there as your squad leader leaves you, or decides to tell you to guard it. ICO made it a pain to do stuff"
"After I.C.O. update i left the game after it made the gun play feel so bad to me. Found out GE mod rolled that back so i came back about 6 months later for that. Now that GE is gone, i don't enjoy playing again. Supermod adds some cool stuff but with the vanilla gun play, it feels like putting makeup on a turd. I know OWI didn't pull the GE mod and that not keeping up with a rules change is why GE lost their License. Just hope they make changes and come back.
Obviously my own opinion."
"Squad used to be a game about small team infantry tactics, combined arms warfare, and blowing shit up with friends in a military themed chat room. 

Now its about Parkinson's disease.

and not only does every military soldier shake violently while shouldering their rifle, THE SWAY IS BASED ON YOUR FPS.

This game has had many other game breaking bugs in the past, and all the bugs stayed for way too long.

Used to be my favorite game of all time."
revert ico game is fucking horrible now
"too many hackers, ESPs, aimbots, ghosting. and they dont get caught."
"Developers keep the game in a stranglehold, introduce bad changes, absurd paid cosmetics and now remove a mod that was becoming more popular than vanilla due to some advertising technicality. They do not permit any meaningful freedom to mod developers nor server owners, absolutely pathetic coming from a game that at its origin ran off the coattails of PR2, a mod/game that was allowed (and still is allowed) to exist only because the developers of BF2 allowed their players the sort of leeway Offworld does not."
Game servers ran by age regressed manchildren.
TRASH GAME
was amazing game until combat over haul :(
"They overhaul the infantry combat system to slow the game way down and make it ""realistic"" and then ignore vehicle physics and damage. Bridging the gap between realism and arcade tac shooting my ***."
"I'm going to preface with this; I love Squad. But I despise the ICO changes. I can't get into the game anymore because of the decisions they made for infantry combat. The only time I play anymore is if my friends are on and playing on a Steel Division mod server, which has ""kinda-sorta"" pre ICO.

I sincerely hope they rework the ICO changes."
gay admins banned me
Removed one of the best mods for the game for no reason
"Offworld industries is running this game like North Korea. They're dictating _everything_ server owners can do and the last straw for me was how they just blatantly kicked out the Global Offensive mod, which was much better and deeper than the base game has ever been.

The devs _NEVER_ comment on anything in Steam forums, be it critique or a development suggestions. They just do what they want and us, the paying customers, can either take what they give us or hit the road.

I can't in good conscience recommend that anyone would hand out their hard earned money to a group of .. people whom treat their customers like trash."
"Honestly a fall from grace of what this game once was, actively claiming realism while buffing obvious light skin vehicles making AT frustrating at best and infantry battles just a slower paced CoD match.

Overall fun amazing gunplay roots with recent shitty buffs to factions that should be unfairly armed but take skill and players co-ordinated to operate effectively and it'd be fun to have an underpowered faction use good teamwork to overcome a better equipped enemy. All factions vehicles are the same with a reskin not really any differences in armor or weapons between them all they all tank the same amount of AT or ATGMs as the opposing force. Blufor are underpowered, Opfor are overpowerd and balanced to a T to please their parent company based in China to not cut their funding.

Good potential, frustrating shit game realistically.
That being said fun to just BS and play with the lads whenever you are bored and want a good more graphically enhanced Arma experience with less focus on realism and more focus on balanced Overwatch-like fun."
"Dont waste your money on this game the devs ruined it ive tried everything to get it to run smooth on my pc but it wont my specs are i9 13900k rtx 3070ti 32gb ramm. If you like running in mud, way too much gun sway, and the slowest ads in a game ive ever seen this may be your game. I cannot refund the game but i hope my honest opinion saves other people money. Your wanna a good game play hell let loose instead,"
Consistently terrible throughout the entire experience. I allow you to seethe in the comments

"As soon as they implemented the new recoil system a while back, I saw videos of it, and hated it immediately. I finally decided to come back a try it out ""it can't be that bad."" It is that bad, this recoil makes no sense, does not get rid of lone wolves and i basically can't see for the majority of the time i'm playing. I can't die, I can't hit anything... So who is this for? Were they attempting to strip the last remaining 200 players of Project Reality? I don't understand why this was necessary or why they have ran with this joke for as long as they have. 
They ruined my favorite game. This was the first game I had a hundred hours in on steam, all the way back in 2016. All the fond memories, all of which I can't relive because they went this horrible direction. The game runs worse, there is LESS communication. I don't know who this game is for anymore, and i'm surprised there are this many people playing it. I don't know what is wrong with some of you, I don't know why you prefer worse quality game play, and I can't begin to imagine why some of you like this recoil. I'm pretty sure you've gaslit yourselves into believing it's fun. Well it isn't. This is not Project Reality. 
I liked the time where, if I wanted to play PR, I'd play PR, if I wanted to play Squad, I'd play Squad. Well now I can't play Squad. Squad doesn't exist anymore. There is only whatever this is, masquerading and bumbling around in the dead rotted corpse of some of my fondest memories. Curse you."
This game was made by the government to correct over population and increase suicide rate
It is bad game.
"I was excited to try Squad. But I was genuinely disappointed. Getting into a server and getting into the action feels like a chore; in fact, most of the game feels like a chore. Most of the time, people are switching squads left and right, and administrators are kicking and banning people. You barely get to see any action. I know this is a team-based shooter with slower-paced gameplay, but damn, this does not feel good to play. The gunplay just feels wonky at best. The game overall feels very niche."
Devs got jealous that a mod was doing better than the base game and had more content & more frequent updates and took it down. I think they forgot that they still profit when people buy their game to play the mod though...
i'd rather rub cs gas into my throat with a brush than play this game again
Awful
bug ridden garbage
I Cannot believe they removed my favourite mod Global Escalation..... Not happy at all. Proximity Chat should function like it states and not be restricted to teams.
"Game is held together with sticks and duct tape. It is in a messy and unprofessional state in terms of its stability.

To name a few of the issues:

Tank armor angle is based on the world position rather than relative. In other words, tank armor is based on your global direction. You can shoot a tank in its weakest spot but because it was facing north it takes no damage. Or vice versa.

Changing your FOV will worsen your scope sway, making it harder to play.

Using a mouse with too high of a refresh rate will SOMEHOW cause your game to lag.

Shooting your gun for the first time in the match will cause a huge lag spike for you.

TOW weapons are client side. Meaning that you can hit on your screen but because the enemy's computer disagrees it doesnt count as a hit.

There are tons on baffling and nonsensical issues that plague the game making it very difficult to play or enjoy. The developers do not seem to be interested in fixing these issues as they have been issues for quite a while and getting worse. I would steer clear until they actually address the stability and playability issues."
too many bug
Day by day it is getting worse. There are problems with the frames. A solution must be developed for this problem. I am tired of the problems. I hope in the next conversations that it will return to what it was like 4 months ago.
devs are obsesed with ruinging the gayeme
"Squad seems to be the only game I have framerate issues with. I think Squad programmers don't seem to know what performant code is, and OWI needs to think about hiring more experienced developers."
GE removal is very dissapointing while vanilla version is boring.
"Well after a long time playing this game was truly amazing. First OWI drops their controversial ICO (Infantry Combat Overhaul) which aimed to make the playstyle more realistic which ended up being the exact opposite making your soldier feel like a 500 pound fat man and take 5 years to bring the weapon optic up to your face which gets you killed by campers (extremely defender sided) I never thought id have to write a review but they recently removed the mod Global Escalation which aimed towards fixing the game and created real world factions such as IDF HAMAS and HEZBOLLAH and proximity chat which made the game so much more enjoyable and when I started playing it a lot more. I felt the game was alive and I had a bond with my squad with the GE mod until it was stripped from the community due to ""controversy and advertisment in the maps and license issues"". which has made me completly delete the game and uninstall it. i will not be coming back until the mod comes back. Fuck you OWI go fix your own game first before you stick your fingers in someone elses hard worked mod that fixed your shit game. Tzahal OUT"
"Gunplay after the ICO update was garbage. Got back into the game after the Global Escalation mod got popular. GE fixed the gunplay added new shit, fixed just about everything OWI refused to. OWI being a bunch of salty bastards removes the only mod making the game good. Bring back Global Escalation!"
"Runs poorly, still waiting for the fun to start, poor community overall. Overhyped."
OWI delisting the most popular mod instead of fixing game breaking bugs
"The game can be fun in the right server, but as of recently server mods and OWI have not been dealing with toxic players who are spewing racial slurs and hate speech in 75% of the different servers I have been in. There is a very convoluted reporting process that does not allow for a timely report to be submitted so most of the time it is not worth it. There is also a very steep learning curve that is very difficult for new players, who are seen as a hindrance by players. I do not recommend downloading this game unless you plan to just chat in discord and not in the server. There is no teamwork as of recent and a lot of team killing and trolling unfortunately. I feel a lot of people blame the large ICO update that happened a while back, but it is definitely just the community becoming toxic that has driven a lot of people away."
Dont recommend they just banned the only good mod that had silencers as well as many other factions..
"recent changes to gunplay have made the gunplay way worse and less fun. the difficulty of finding games where both teams are organized and competitive means you can waste an hour on a game that's decided in the first five minutes. when the actual gunplay isn't fun any more, the downsides mean it is often becomes a boring walking simulator. that said, driving a logistics truck around the back lines is decently zen and fun. so buy if you are into trucking games."
"After its newest update and with GE being ripped from us following the update, this game is as vanilla as ever..."
"Removed the only thing keeping this game alive, our beloved OWI removes mods that become more popular than the base game. Global Escalation was the only thing that kept me playing this game, the vanilla game including factions, weapons and vehicles are a direct downgrade from the mod. But hey, at least we got Arma Reforger been having a blast and recommend it to anyone."
Global escalation was the only thing keeping this game alive. It's about to be dead just like Squad 44.
"Game used to be so fun, but afyer the latest updates its literally bags of shits, instead of arms of a trained soldier you get 90 year old grampa with noodle hands that can barely hold the gun, and then they removed GLOBAL Escolation mod that fixed the most issues and made the game even more fun."
"NO WAY !!! They just removed the best mod in the game, Global Escalation. Until this changes, this game is NOT worth it, at all. I just can't believe the Devs made such poor decision, you know what, this is what you get !"
"They've just removed the last good thing about this game, Global Escalation. Until this changes, this game is NOT worth it, at all."
game used to be good
.
Everything on squad was going good until they decided to do away with global escalation if they dont bring it back im not playing anymore
imagine having a game run on a single cpu core and not fixing it
game is good on good servers and game is horrific on bad servers.  Most of the servers in Asia have zero communication and you are left to just play a shitastic version of call of duty.  Game is worthless in asia.
"Trash game, would not recommend. Wish I could refund but i kept giving it a try to double check if i was the problem and not the game. Nope, game is ass. Hell Let Loose is so much better."
games toxic wish this was made with proper servers not wanna be military geeks running servers battlefield modded servers are 10x better hackers everywhere
"I shot and missed, uninstalled"
Just dont
"Attaching weapon sway to your FPS is of course deeply meritocratic in nature, but still kinda unfair"
"Feels like a hungry 14 year old is handling the guns, hipfire has a higher accuracy than aiming and 80% of guns have useless scopes, sprinting makes you drunk and you won't get much FPS"
game just literaly dosent work and black screen loads for hours till u cant refund anymore shame too since the starwars mod looked kinda fun
can more people tell them to optimize the game. i have a 4090 and ryzen 7950x3d like cmon why does this game run like such shit they havent optimized it since early access this just isnt okay
base game an global esc NOT good only lazer mod worth a darn wouldnt recommmend
"ICO SUCKS!!! This is so realistic its not even called realistic anymore its beyond that... Like Parkinson's disease hand simulator... Tu parece um bêbado atirando de cabeça para baixo vendado e caolho, simples assim."
"If you load up the game you payed for and decline their privacy policy, the game just closes. 

Lmfao"
"Infantry overhaul is pain in the ass, marksman role is useless, overall recoil of the game is so EPIC 2x times bigger then shooting NEGEV from CSGO :D... unplayable
Every single SQUAD player is complaining about chicken HANDS, suppression not giving blur but makes your recoils 10x bigger and to shoot while you just finished running is impossible. GIVE US THE GOOD OLD SQUAD INFANTRY BACK... 
Armours unplayable too, shots now depends on how tanks are turned, because of god damns DEV bugs for armour units..."
The optimization of this game after a couple of updates Is held by hopes and dreams
The optimization in this game is awful. I have a rig that will run most games on ultra settings. this game does good to get 30 on medium. and then your always having connection or network issues. i have gig speed internet and still have this problem. they say in game dont forget to verify the integrity of your game files on steam to keep the game running good but i shouldnt have to do that. while in battle theres a constant stream of disconnected players on the top left of the screen. that said the idea behind this game is awesome and it can be alot of fun and is insanely in depth and can go deeper just fix the issues with it
"In 2024, it shows its age. The game is poorly optimized with numerous unnecessary visual effects that look good but ruin the performance. Additionally, if you do not enjoy the modern warfare atmosphere, you may quickly become bored with this game.

Squad attempts to offer a realistic and immersive military experience, but several key issues hold it back:

Optimization Issues: Despite its potential, the game's poor optimization leads to frequent frame drops and lag, making it difficult to enjoy, especially during intense firefights.

Visual Effects: While the visual effects are impressive, they are often overdone. This results in a visually appealing game that, unfortunately, suffers from significant performance issues.

Modern Warfare Theme: The modern warfare setting may not appeal to everyone. If you are not a fan of this genre, you might find yourself losing interest rather quickly.

Complexity and Learning Curve: The game’s realistic mechanics require a steep learning curve. New players might find it overwhelming without prior experience in similar games.

Genre Competition: If you are already playing a game in a similar genre, there is little reason to switch to Squad. The game does not offer enough unique features to justify the change in my opinion."
"This is my favourite game and i have a lot of good memories from it and i also have met few good friends in it. 
The reason i post a negative review is Because the Devs don't make good decisions. the game doesnt need more content, it never needed after the amphibious update. What this game needs is Bug fixes and A LOT OF Optimisation. i remember when this game was enjoyable to play because it gave me more than 30FPS and the FPS didnt effect the gun's recoil"
maps are too big
"After 821 hours in this game, I decided to come back and see if it got any better from the weapon/aiming updates they did to the game. Before the changes, the game was great. Thus the reason for the 821 hours into the game. 

After coming back to it and playing for a day, I remembered the reason why i decided to delete it. If you're looking for a better game, look at Hell Let Loose. 

Yes, this has more vehicles and helicopters, but overall the combat isnt that fun in this."
auto replay not working
if you love watching paint dry for 5 hours and occasionally having your balls stepped on then this is the game for you
fun game bad optimization dont get it unless nasa computer
far too technical for such a toxic and racist community
I would recommend this game if someone could give me the game
"Instead of fixing bugs and adding some more functions in game to let us have fun, they are adding a new fractions, useless animations and vehicles with more bugs in them.
10 years of development $500k spent and $6 mil earned, can't you fucking FIX THE DAMN BUGS??
When was the last time you guys fixed SOMETHING at LEAST.

Here are some bugs:
- When reloading the weapon and completing the animation it's not really reloading it, it's getting stuck in SUPERPOSITION, can't reload again and can't shoot, you need to wait 3-5 minutes to let it fix.
- Character and camera are sometimes getting disconnected from their axis.
- While shooting from heli MG, you may get shot from your own bullet cuz there are no physics in this game, heli goes faster than bullet i guess.
- Unable to place defensive structures on places which you can literally see but for some reason it says ""placement out of sight"".
- Bots able to shoot through the walls and cross middle points (red zones) while seeding.
- There's one particular RPG which you can't shoot, it's shooting but freezing in the middle of the air before impact.
- Fraction voting, this is a joke, there are times when there is only 1 country to choose from all 6 individual options, CHINA CHINA CHINA in every god damn option.
- Fix the shadows
- When sitting on Humvee's 50 cal if you aim up, you feel like your head is down and they can't shoot you but in reality your head is still up and this gives you confusion of how they killed you.
- Mines disappearing after you look away (Am i joke to you?)


Things which should have been added:
- God damn mirrors on vehicles (there are no mirrors)
- Helicopter repelling system
- Helicopter Autopilot (every god damn heli have autopilot)
- Function to rename your squad (you have to disband your squad and create new one in order to follow the server rules for claiming the vehicle.
- More choice of scopes on rifles.
- Commander able to call artillery strike from the map and not only if he/she sees it.
- It shouldn't take this much time to equip a pistol while holding rifle or RPG.
- Animations should be allowed on battlefield, that's what they are for.
- Fire Team Leads should be able to find out the fucking range when marking something.

Hope you chicken nugget brained Project Managers and Owners will see this.
FIX BUGS! DO NOT ADD MORE OF THEM!"
textures not loading
"Rarely do people ever use comms anymore, dont bother playing"
I had more fun when you could shoulder your rifle.
"Clear line of sight, aim, fire 2 rounds, and I'm blind.....stupid. Enemies and friendlies wear IDENTICAL equipment. Stupid. You change your weapon, loadout, or sight......and you spawn with 1 primary mag/belt and no secondary ammo, bandages, or grenades. This is the worst MILSIM i have played in a long time."

"You are a trained soldier for whichever nation, so ofcourse you'll be moving like a grandmother.
You are a trained soldier, getting shot at and adrenaline is pumping, ofcourse you'll take 99 years to aim down sights.
You are a trained soldier, with adrenaline pumping through your veins. Ofcourse running 20 meters will be your outmost limit!!11

The overhaul is complete dogshit and i dont understand why they have implemented it. Surely not for realism, and if this perfromance is realistic in their minds, its because theyre office fatties that put on some gear and weapons, tried running and thought "" man that sure was hard "".

I dont see how else they deem this overhaul realistic lol."
"clunky, don't buy unless under 5 usd"
who asked for this voting system? it makes this game repetitive and dull. Also the stupid aiming mechanics - knee cap entire factions for no reason. usa vs russia. yawn.
ass
Game blue screened ):
i was yelled at by a bunch of 30 year old wanna be mil sim fat lards that cant move there own legs to join the army
full of russians to many
"pretty bad game, too bad i am not eligible for a refund anymore"
"""realistic"" shooter. Player literally has not held a gun in their life or past lives. Cannot aim properly, recoil everywhere, honestly the original tarkov recoil is better then the recoil in this game. Someone chirping a fire alarm over prox chat was better and more enjoyable then the infantry gameplay. Armor slaps though."
cant sex the soldiers :(
:)
"If you play in OCE it's very difficult to get a server through the week as all are full or seeding at 10-20/100 players and never get above that. If you do find a server, prepare to have everyone lock squads and leave you to your own devices on enormous maps while other squad leaders complaining about you being 'useless'. 

Also playing the tutorial and one full game will put you outside of the 2 hour window for a refund, so hope you find out if you like it in the tutorial."
"Updating review after 500 more hours:

Bugs still in the game from multiple years ago. Performance struggles more and more with each update. Half baked content and devs that don't play their own game. Either wayyyyy over nerfing things or wayyyyy over balancing them. 

Its again the common problem of a game with great potential that gets spanked by indifferent/ignorant devs or a corporate system that just doesn't care. 

I still play the game often but its more because there aren't any alternatives that really fill the gap. Hopefully the dev team will actually pay attention to the communities needs/wants and give us better tools, a *real* performance update and balance things better."
i dont get it
"I love the game, i love the community the game fosters,but i cannot in good conscience recommend this game on the basis of its poor optimization; update after update OWI has introduced more things to play with but never adequately optimizing the game."
"Inferior overpriced Project Reality, hald @$$ed realism for 70$"
"If you enjoy military simulators then buy Arma 3 or some 1st person simulator because this game is absolute garbage.

Only upside is you can refund it :P"
Constant crashes even with graphics settings at the lowest. I have a RTX 3060ti and a Ryzen 7 5700x and this game still wants to keep crashing on me
allahu akbar
"honestly not a fun game, you can barely even see the enemy and your team mates should have blue/green CLEAR markers on who they are otherwise your just getting team kills.  the cheaters in the game is UNREAL"
"this is the WORST fps money can buy, guns are unrealistic, game play is lack, you have a bunch of kids who think they are real life soldiers, be ready to have like 15 people blairing music full blast or screaming to try and blow out your ear drums, for a game thats based off real military exp then it should be just that a real milsim exp, not this."
"low fps, vsing invisible bush wookies, only good thing is the voip"
lots of lags
Talvez mi computadora no corra este juego pero si qué esta mal en mi para mi.
"Controls are not correct.  I constantly have to close the game and restart because basic movement does not work at times.  Examples?  ""A"" does not work to strife left sometimes.  The map sometimes keeps popping up for no reason at all during game play.  Pops up immediately when I close it.  So frustrating!  Totally feel like I wasted my money"
Last game reece played with us... #RipMyDrilla
Good game but very annoying at time with the loading bugs and errors. could do with some work in the launching aspect of the game !
They need to fix the infantry overhaul. The infantry overhaul sucks.
FAGGOT NOT LETTING ME INTO THE CAR
"The overhaul is the worst thing the devs had came up with. This is a game that is meant to be enjoyed, not a game that is considered as ""too realistic"" after the overhaul, you can't even shoot a guy that is 3 ft away from you, that sucks, the weapon sway is way too far from realistic. I myself a gun owner, I can say that this overhaul is a fail. You'll lose players in the long run if you wont fix this, it is too impossible to shoot enemies even at 100 meters away even if you have a bipod/tripod on."
The infantry overhaul sucks!! not worth
"Came back to this after a hiatus of about a year and...

WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO MY BOY!

the map vote, means its ALWAYS desert maps, USA v RUS, without fail.

And the new weapon sway? unusable. I had a shootout in my last game, we were less than 25m from each other. We actually both  ran out of ammo and decided to run away. 

Also, in games of past I had a cool 50+ fps even with the recreation of Armageddon taking place, but now, one barrage and my game is a slideshow...

OWI, what did you do!?"
"Great game when it works, but far too difficult to find a server - I spent 45 minutes queuing in various queues. Only to join a server where all the squads were locked and you are kicked after 4 minutes without a squad. If you create a squad you have to lead it. In order to lead a squad you need to know what you are doing - but you can't learn that if you can never play. 

On the rare off chance you can play it, the game is great."

"Played Squad for years.

The ICO needs some tweaks, but that's nothing.
I used to be able to play smoothly with mid/high settings.
The game gradually got worse and worse performance wise, with everything on low, the same rig painfully gets around 50 FPS with stutters.

Changed my 2060 super for a 4070 super.
Nothing changed.

OCed my Ryzen 3700X 8 core
Nothing changed.

32 GB ram since the beginning.

Do something please, I can't play it anymore"
"I would give this game a good review, but this audio not working has been a problem for how long now??? You fix things that dont matter and ignore things that make people not want to play your game."
"god i wish they just had the time and money to make this game feel good. this game has everything you want content wise, it is just SEVERELY lacking as far as its bugginess and play-ability. half the games i play it feels like my character is off a full bottle of benadryl its so sluggish and aggravating. even on my friends pc which has a 3080 ti and i9 it feels like shit. ive managed to force myself through near 700 hours of this game and am finally coming to a point where i cant stand its spaghetti code any longer. i really love this game, but its just too aggravating now. i have a 1080 ti, i7-7800x, game is on my ssd, and i have ethernet making 100+ mb/s, monitor 240hz, and drink enough coors light to make any family man grab his keys and go on a drunken blast through residential streets(i can force myself to do things that are bad for my mental and physical wellbeing{like playing this game}) please fix this shit"
"I want to recommend Squad, but the game has made some very bad game play decisions. Some examples:
- Community servers. The state of most servers right now is horrendous. With clan stacking being the norm and ""new player friendly"" servers being an excuse to ignore game play basics (lone wolf players (cough HAT/Marksman/Combat Engineer) and silent squads). 
- The ICO overhaul. Say what you want about it, but we have to agree that most of the community player base can't handle it. After OWI spent years drawing in more casual players and pushing away the experienced player base, they changed gun handling for the worse. Now the vast majority of the player base can't hit anything outside of 200m.
- Faction voting and sub-factions. While a good idea, it butchered the game's balance. Factions were previously balanced around certain maps with certain vehicle assets for that map. The system now is a rock-paper-scissors game where you hope your team picks a sub-faction that can compete with what the enemy picks. Oops your team meme picked the British support sub-faction and the enemy went Russian armored, enjoy watching your heli's get main gunned out of the sky while your armor gets rolled by T-90s (fighting a T-90 in a Challenger is hilariously painful). Oops you picked a non support or armored sub-faction against the Insurgents, enjoy getting your only HAB mortared/IED'd or the funny four IEDs on the commander drone that keeps your tank from ever seeing the battle (the drone call-in timer is less than the tanks respawn timer). Most Factions now need a major rebalancing before the voting system works in pubs."
over rated and over hyped  save your money adds are very misleading and older players are very judgy and wont help you out understanding a lot of things
"Do not buy this game. They are a Canadian based gaming company who do not tolerate any forms of speech the admins don't agree with. Save your money if you're looking for something fun to play.

They also have certain actions developed in the game that you can do that can get you banned as a regular player. I didn't know this and that is grounds as a scam.

Again, save your money."
Als HAT die ganze Runde nichts machen können. Entweder campen irgendwelche hobbylosen harzer in der letzten Ecke und snipen dich weg oder du siehst einfach nichts weil dein ganzer Bildschirm verschwommen ist nach einem beinahe treffer von nem Panzer. Abnormaler Müll und Game bockt gar nicht mehr. Geld definitiv nicht wert
"Coming from Project Reality I can't recommend Squad with the present community. Game named Squad but there's no proper squads, lack of communication, lack of discipline, lack of everything that makes a game a military sim. Good job to the developers for developing a pretty good game(Except the UI which might be the most confusing stuff I've ever seen in a video game) but without a community playing the game as it was created to be played its not worth trying it. Every time I play this the squad is either spread out, together but pushing straight into a death trap or not communicating at all."
Are you friendly or enemy simulator
"Spawnkilling, toxic players who boot you from your SQUAD and reset your loadout so you can't get the interesting gear as a newbie, garbage maps that are way too big unless you play this game with a dedicated semi-pro or pro team for days and days to learn, way too ""realistic"" HUD (I don't mind some to avoid being arcadey but not being able to see your ammo count or prevent friendly fire if you're colorblind is annoying and doesn't add anything to the experience). Toxic userbase. Poor man's Battlefield 2. Expect to trudge around and die alot with no clue why or how, a lot. Not fun in the least except to Milsimps who like to wipe the floor with pick up groups to compensate for their micropenises."
"Used to love this game, but slowly over time the player base has degraded and thus the quality of game has diminished. In theory great game. The infantry overhaul was a great idea, but it turned off too many of the experienced players, who wanted even games.
Now we are mostly left with long server wait times, followed by heavily uneven games, between which teams are not balanced."
"Game itself is amazing, but the lack of performance is a very very very big down fall!!!!!!!!!!!!! the Fps drops, stutters, and over all performance is completely TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i run a Asus Rog 4090 OC , 10900k, with 64gb ram at 4000mhz. samsung g series 240hz screen and i get NO MORE THEN 100 FPS MAX MAX if im lucky 15-20% cpu usage, and 20-30 GPu usage. no matter what settings are used does not and WILL NOT go above 100 fps EVER!!!! getting as low as 30 fps!!!!!! example i can run Cyberpunk MAX everything and still get 144 fps. so to me a very much less demanding game like Squad i should easily be getting much more fps"
"Revert I.C.O for 3 months and see what the newbs think. Then re install the I.C.O. and watch all the spam ""Good game."" reviews go away."
"Haven't enjoyed playing infantry since the ICO update, haven't enjoyed any match at all with faction voting."
"its a very bad game and you dont know even who to shoot ... its a worst 38 min of my gaming life .. its bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad ... irts like you dont know where are you or who is with who or what r u doing or what ,..... baaaaaaaaaaad"
"If you don't live in Turkey, do NOT waste your money on it, there's no active players at all, I've literally waited 7 hours to find a match and found one but it was for Turkish people only and they only spoke Turkish, the game is really good but as an online-only game it's unplayable without other active players worldwide."
"Pre-ICO? I'd recommend this game 10 times out of 10.

Post ICO? Lol. Lmao, even."
Walking simulator.
"4 years since the official release date and still no offline vs bots support. Even PRBF2 does have it, a formidable game like this lacking such a simple feature is a big no for me."
ICO ruined my enjoyment of this game. If they tone it all down a little I might come back and try it out. Until then I will not play this game again.
this combat update took you from being a trained soldier to being a gimp picking up a rifle for the first time. I can shoot an AK with one hand and have less recoil and sway than this. I know the devs probably saw body cam and thought it would be a cool idea to do that for their game but you can tell the two teenagers put more effort into making it work than this entire team did.
"Sold out to the Chinese communist gobermint and you wonder why the Chinese faction gets buffs and stupid emojis in the game. Enjoy yer dictator money. Won't be seeing my freedom buckos or freedom time spent on this until Tencent is gone~

Shame, game use to be decent~"
"Returned to the game after not playing for awhile and I can easily say the Infantry Combat Overhaul update absolutely ruined the game play. It changed nothing about infantry other than making aiming insanely frustrating. Anyone who says they like the changes either didn't play before the update, only play vehicles, or are a liar."
Did you just wait in a 20+ queue and now you are the next one to join? Ha! connection issue back of the queue for you. Did you just get into a match after literally waiting an hour becuase there are only a handful of good playable servers? Disconnect. F you. No fun allowed.
"Overall I feel like there's something that just feels off about Squad when I compare it to my experience playing Hell let loose & Squad 44.  Those games have been full of incredible moments time after time, where as Squad has so far felt dull and a big waste of time.

I'm willing to give it another go, so my review may change but as of now I would not recommend it over similar games."
"The game feels really slow, it feels like it takes 10 minutes to run a kilometer. the maps are VERY spaced out and sparse of action. You cant spawn vehicles anywhere or find them anywhere on the map other than main base so get used to running. On top of the very slow game play, every gun has the recoil of a PKM for some odd reason. oh ya and my joystick doesn't work with this game"
"I love the format of this game and gameplay, but server admins can't take a joke and will perma ban you to take the fun out of the game and every server is the same way due to game rules. They also made the game more demanding on your PC without the graphics looking better since the last few updates."
"Coming back to this game after the ICO update, I can't believe people enjoy that amount of ""handicapping"" this game has done to infantry. It's extremely difficult to aim after a short run to where it's not even close to anything realistic. I feel like someone is molesting the end of my rifle when I try to ADS. I understand they want to make it more team oriented, but they didn't need to ruin the joy of actually shooting."
"You need to optimize the game, it's almost impossible to play it every second stuck"
all servers have a minimum 10 minute wait. when you finally get into a server i almost instantly get kicked.
The servers are not te find in this game. itryed everything but still show no servers
"It was good, but Devs are not solving DX12 crash issues, grafics are very bad and Arma reforger does everything better by factor 10.

As MilSim player I was happy to have Squad, but it didn't developed very well in a technical sense. The only reason for Squads existense is that Armas entrance barrier was so high. With arma reforger as a tech demo for arma 4 it seems like the days of Squad for real Milsim Gamers are over."
"Game sucks, you won't ever see the enemy and they will always kill you before you do.

No joke, this is one of the worst games I have every wasted too much time on.

All of the mechanics and gun play is perfectly fine, you will just never get a chance to actually use it on the enemy."
ICO
ICO did this game dirty
terrible
This game used to be good. This is no longer true.
Game runs and looks like shit. Instead of optimisation we get weapon skins and emotes. Borderline unplayable.
"For some reason the gameplay is not interesting and confusing at all. Compared to warzone, this game is very far behind with a distance of tens of kilometers"
"the developers have slop in their heads, a vivid example of ""how to fuck up a promising game"""
"Pretty much meh, buggy, clunky, just yeah meh"
"Was a great game, not anymore."
once great game but its just shit now
"The developers don’t understand what they’re doing, it feels like the team of developers has already changed 2 or 3 times, or this game is being made by an outsourced company, otherwise I can’t explain how you can make the game worse and worse with each update, not fix bugs for years and still create visibility of work on the game.
Introducing new things into the gameplay without preliminary long testing, it all has already turned into one huge snowball. There is no longer any faction balance that still existed before the introduction of units, which was also destroyed by ICO update without reworking/adjusting number of tickets on all layers for each faction.
Every new update they release some thing that no one asked for and it turns the gameplay into hell. Then they try to fix it, introduce something new for balance, and then immediately add another piece of garbage that no one asked for and it breaks another part of the balance/gameplay.
Btw this game has nothing to do with PR in any way and never will be in the future."
Absolutely terrible gunplay
"[h1] MY SCORE: 3.5/5.0 [/h1]


Gameplay: ■■■■■■■■□□
Graphics: ■■■■■■□□□□
Sound: ■■■■■■■□□□


[i] This game has potential, that's for sure, but lack of optimization is killing the immersive aspect of this game. When you buy a high-end PC, you expect to play this game on 120 FPS consistently. Graphics are nothing special and every FPS drop is really bothering. Gameplay is good, realistic and feels like you are in a war, but games today don't have any optimizations in them and I can't recommend this game to anyone who don't have really, really strong hardware. Skip this one for now! [/i]"
DOA
It's the biggest piece of dogshit
Better buy Arma 3
.
Гра не тягне на новіших ПК. Оптимізуйте гру!!!!
Boring asf
"This game used to be so much fun until the infantry overhaul. I can no longer recommend it to anyone looking for a good FPS experience. The inertia, weapon sway, and recoil is unbelievably over-tuned, and the stamina system is just obnoxious. It takes a good 10 seconds to come from a light jog to lining up a shot accurately, and it has nothing to do with the FPS skill of the player. It's also hilarious how inaccurate hip-firing is. You almost have no choice but to sit in one spot or crab-walk around the map. It's just not fun at all anymore."
this game has so much potential but until they're able to optimize the game i am going to have to say pass on getting the game
"The game that I fell in love with doesn't exist anymore. A series of poor decisions and terrible updates have spoiled Squad. I spent a lot of late nights with some good people on this game in 2022 but wouldn't suggest it these days. The community seems worse than it used to be as well, impressively.

Might still be worth a try for the veterans; I know it was cathartic for me at one point in time."
2022 squad better
"learning curve is steep, community is mid. gun go brr tho"
"Old Squad was good, teams worked together and things happened. Then everything changed when the corporate overlords attacked. Infantry Combat Overhaul is the -Worst- single decision I've ever seen a game make; if Parkinsons Simulator meets Walking Simulator is your thing, this is the game for you. Otherwise, the buyout completely ruined Vanilla Squad. The only worthwhile servers are ones that use mods like Global Escalation that reverse that garbage update. 

Oh, they're also just ripping content from modding communities and calling it their own for their latest updates now, like the MK19, the M113, new factions, etc. They don't make any decent content anymore."
trash game ...poorly optimized
"Update
Its ok, noodle arms is annoying even when standing still and the ability of someone to shoot through the edge of the wall to 'headshot' your toe for a kill is annoying.

Update with the new PMCs 8.1
Noodle arms is really annoying and feels like its more RNG Jesus if your bullet will go straight within 10m instead of not. Some days you will land all your shots, another you will be prone, laying down, holding still and the arms will still go all wiggly on you."
Mod not working
"A game where I'm effectively a child soldier when it comes to weapon handling. On top of muzzle climb being far greater than it should ever be, now I can't even aim my rifle. If this was a child soldier simulator, I guess this could make sense, but the fact that this is meant to be a realistic game, I don't see the realism in how untrained these soldiers are at firing their rifles."
shit game
Very sensitive community. not worth the time.
"noodle arms. useless scopes, terrible guns. Squad was better long time ago. I'm out"
"This was a $40 cad game, wtf happened."
"Honestly i would not recommend the game right now. After the combat update the game just does not feel as enjoyable as it used to. The whole aiming and scope moving this i feel is way too much right now. I believe if the game moved to a sort of a middle ground between this update and how it used to, it would be awesome. Otherwise great game"
"Only works for high tec alienware pc, fps lag is crazy for this simple budget game"
Making it take 10 years for a sight to stabilize just so you can shoot once before having to wait again was the most retarded decision OWI has ever made.
every time it throws me out of the game and it is annoying me so much
"Sad to down vote this game, but the recent changes to the infantry is quite unplayable. Being suppressed actually makes you blind and unable to play the game and the changes to the scopes are terrible. It feels the only way to have a decent time in this game now is with vehicles. It is a shame but I have uninstalled this and will not install until they fix the infantry gameplay."
"Fun game, ruined by lack of optimization. Developers more interested in putting out yet another faction no one asked for instead of fixing basic game breaking issues. Don't."
The servers are just awful. List of rules the length of your arm. Get kicked out of vehicles for no reason. Can't recommend this game.
Game great woman mad
:(
"Thank you for killing my favourite videogame with useless ICO. Not even talking about the optimization, textures from 2006, bugs which has not been fixed for years and all the promises of content to be delivered which never came to life. You keep adding new factions which, at the end of the day, are just reskins. The gameplay stays the same. There are so many exciting things which could have been added to the game, but instead, you decide to rework the shooting mechanics when it was absolutely unnecessary. Good luck with piling this videogame further into the mud with your incompetent game developing."
not what it use to be. the gun play sucks and is not fun
"last time i played was more than a year ago, and to absolutely no ones surprise they ruined the game because every single developer these days make changes simply for the sake of change. your character feels like they are walking on the surface of jupiter and went through physical therapy for 2 broken legs that never healed correctly. i understand that its supposed to be your heavy equipment but its so poorly done and feels awful. and ADS is completely unusable unless your laying prone. after a light sprint if you try to ADS it takes about 3 whole seconds to have a good look down your sights, make that 5 seconds if youre using a scope or ACOG. if youre truly going for realism then take away maps. soldiers dont carry maps with them that show live attack plans. and why do guns never jam or have to be maintained? why can i get shot in the face just for my team mate to magically revive me 7 seconds later? the point im making is this isnt all that realistic of a game anyways so you might as well just give the combat a bit more of an arcadey feel so that we can at least actually shoot at people."
"Just came back to this game after a few months and it constantly crashes. 

Unplayable in its current state."
Aiming sucks
"gimme your data 
  -squad"
"the game is a walking simulator, and onec you get into combat, you imidaitly get shot, plus most of the game your doing nothing"
it  crashes everytime
"Squad is like you took the worst parts of Insurgency and Arma and put them together.

Which is a particularly bad compromise.

It also runs like poo"
"i join a squad, get kicked from squad, join another squad, get kicked from other squad, get kicked from server for not being in a squad for 0.03 microseconds.....never again"
"No longer a solid game. Don't say anything that might offend someone in most any server, never mind the fact that the game is about shooting ppl in the head. It is my understanding that this is enforced / forced by the publisher of the game since they control the servers you rent *unconfirmed*. 

Decent game if you dont mind keeping your mouth shut. STAY AWAY, there are plenty of other games."
"The reviews for a game like Squad should never be in the ""Very Positive"". Like have you ever even played?? So here I am. Spreading hate."

"in the 16 hours ive played this game the only thing that has consistently happened is getting kicked from squads and not being able to do anything in the game and god forbid you touch the wrong class or ""someone's"" vehicle or turret they will stop at nothing to get you removed or more often kicked from the server and the community just lets it happen with the notion who ever screams the loudest is right dont buy this game unless its on sale or you love not being able to play it"

Bad Game
Helicopter controls are crap...
"I would really love it if the game devs worked on making this game run better and optimising it. I have a better PC than most and my PC meets the recommended requirements, however with the settings on the lowest options and screen resolution on 100% the games performance for me is basically unplayable. I can't get more than 25 frames in the game when no one else is around. If I get in a gun fight CQB my game freezes, if there are too many explosions my game just crashes. I used to be able to run this game no problem, but now, my game stutters like crazy just on the main menu and can’t even run the game intro smoothly. I think this is easily the best realism game on the market now, however, unless you have a pc that is significantly better than the recommended requirements, don’t get it."
".,"
This game is so bland.

The game play is painfully slow to the point where it becomes boring.
"be happy in life, you don't need squad"
Fun game before they ruined it with the updates to the infantry and aiming mechanics. I had 700 hours in this game and instantly lost interest when they did the update. Truly a shame since it was such an amazing game.
"Servers are impossible to join. You start a queue at position 8 and end up at position 12, 30 minutes later. Most of the time squads aren't available to join so you're stuck as a solo squad lead. Ultra-wide often breaks sending you into an even wider aspect ratio and make it unable to change your screen type with F11."
"Most toxic and sweaty community in the world. You get kicked out of squads and servers for so little and get called names if you don't know every tiny part and detail of the game and maps or don't like getting micromanaged by kids who role play army. I have played this game for many years and the community just keeps getting worse. And if you say anything about it you get swarmed by fanboys. 

If you're looking to play something after work and have a fun and relaxing time with this is not for you."

"After returning to this game after more than a year-long pause, it seems the infantry overhaul has really broken the game. Now, you either play as a ""bush wookie"" or pray to hit with the spray. No person in the world swings their weapon around like these soldiers in the game. It has taken all the fun away. This is not the ""realistic combat""...."

bok gibi oyun. bozdular
got banned 5 minutes into a server for disrupting the chain of command when the squad leader asked if i had a mic. i was turning on my input device.
"I hate this game. I regret buying it. I wish I could refund it, but I spent so much time working around the glitches and doing the tutorials that I'm over the steam 2-hour refund limit. I should have skipped the tutorials so I could see how painful the game was to play before running out of refund time.

I spent a couple hours just doing the tutorials, during which the game crashed twice. Though the multiplayer mode didn't crash on me, I found it very frustrating, buggy, and unpolished.

Infantry:
This is the core of the game, and the most ""finished"" part. Join a squad, ride in a troop transport, (hopefully) dismount before making contact with enemy, then... play, I guess. Don't try to just walk/run/sprint to objectives from spawn. It's like 10x worse than Hell Let Loose for how long you have to run to get anywhere. Maps are HUGE. And you'll sprint for 20 minutes just to get randomly shot and killed without ever seeing your attacker. Sort of like DayZ.

Most guides suggest starting with rifleman or medic, with a scope. I tried medic. I was on voice comms with my squad and local, responding to orders, trying to coordinate, etc. But after hours of ""playing"" this game, I finally rage quit. It's just too frustrating. I play lots of Hell Let Loose and Insurgency, and I thought I understood the basics of cover, concealment, and flanking, but Squad makes me feel helpless. I go prone and try to sneak through shadows and shrubbery. So slowly.... then get killed randomly. I try sprinting between cover, and I get mowed down by machine guns. I move with the squad, use smoke, etc., and we all get destroyed. I almost never even see the enemy.

And there are no friendly markers. You have to know if you're looking at an enemy by the uniform. And most teams have green camo. You often have to know which side someone's on by slight differences in helmet shape. And you have to be so good at it that you can get a shot off before you're mowed down by way more experienced players. There is no Co-op PvE like in Insurgency. Just gotta ""get gud"" somehow. At some point, I just shot at anyone running towards me. I was medic, so I just apologized and revived them if it was a friendly.

After 8 hours of trying to learn to play the game, and not enjoying hardly any of it, I got killed by an enemy who sneaked up on me from behind while I was prone in the middle of nowhere in a forest. I assumed he was half a mile away, but my friend watching my steam stream actually saw the guy who shot me and screenshotted it. I was looking right at him and couldn't see. Combination of screen blurring because suppression, and his camo blending in.

And again, I see the usual bleeding out screen, complete with constant nauseating camera twitching for 300 seconds. And again, I'm yelling at the computer screen, saying ""My guy is supposed to be unconscious! Why does the camera always act like my character's having a seizure!?"" This game is supposed to be out of early access?

And the voice comms... They technically work, but squads are so big, and there are so many people talking all the time, it's very hard to communicate. And between matches, the game puts you into all-talk, where you get to hear 100 adults screaming like autistic children... every time. And I couldn't find a way to mute this madness.

I could probably spend 1,000 hours before I got even somewhat competant in this game. But I don't enjoy it at all.

Helicopter flight:
Don't buy this game for helicopter flight. The primary (and expected) method of control is keyboard+mouse. And it's terrible. You could also use a joystick, but only _one_ joystick. Maybe an xbox controller or an all-in-one cheap joystick with a throttle slider and twist axis. HOTAS is not supported, because this game (like most 1990's games) only supports one joystick. It combines all joystick inputs into one. To get around this, you need to install a combination of vJoy, Joystick Gremlin, and HID Hide, and learn how to set them up so Squad only sees one joystick. It's not fun. Oh, and TrackIR and other head tracking are not supported. The quick-look keys cause the screen to constantly flash, so they're useless. The recommended setup (according to Reddit) is to use hacks to set TrackIR to act as a mouse, and set mouse look to always on. A game that claims to not be in Early Access should not require all these hacks. And from what I understand, the helicopter controls have been this bad since about 2021, when they first introduced joystick control. They have a ""roadmap"" to fix it, but it's been 3 years.

Helicopter flight model is sort of like flying a brick, IMO. It doesn't seem to be reacting to air, just momentum. The exception is the air cushion effect when close to the ground, which seems to be modeled decently.

Helicopter gameplay on multiplayer amounts to someone making a locked squad and taking the helicopter, if there is one on the map. Not all maps get one.

If you want to have fun flying a helicopter, just get DCS, or even an old DOS game like Apache '95.

Vehicles:
Driving vehicles with keyboard is about on par with other first-person games, except for the motorcycle, which is very hard to control. Mouse-look is acceptable.

Most of my vehicle gameplay was joining a tank squad, riding as spotter, driving around for 15+ minutes, trading shots with enemy tank for 15 seconds, then blowing up. Kinda dull.

Some vehicles have a machine gun mounted on top. Most of the time, using this just gets you killed nearly instantly when an enemy shows up.

Graphics/sound:
Quite nice. Game runs at about 45-55fps on my RTX 3090 on the high setting. Setting it to medium and disabling antialiasing brings it up to almost 60fps. I appreciate that smoke grenades actually spray smoke instead of just having a generic smoke cloud appear. I appreciate the picture-in-picture scope view. I like the depth-of-field on iron sights. I like the look and feel when shooting through the wood floor in the tutorial. It feels like the wood is actually splintering. Graphics feels modern and realistic.

Conclusion: Many of the biggest issues have been there for years and may never get fixed. Buy it on sale if you like punishment. Otherwise, get an airsoft gun and play soldiers IRL. Many will just say ""get gud"". Yes, that's true. You can go spend 1,000 hours ""getting gud"". Maybe the game will even be fun for you then."
"Its too slow and they need to optimise the game i have a 3060 and sometimes im getting 20 fps on the lowest settings, the game is really difficult and when i scope or shoot i feel like throwing up it makes me dizzy they need to make it so that you can see who your teammates are and not make them all look the same"
"The keeps crashing, it is depressing. This game so good, but it just optimized for new PC build. I never had an issue with this game 1 year ago. At the time I had AMD everything and worked great. Now that I upgraded, I can not even run the game. It sad. So much potential."
Queue sim thanks to lack of matchmaking
crashing all the time
"This game was made by damn geniuses on LSD.
I still feel like I'm in an acid trip. I've never played such a fine brand of cocaine before. The latest update is just a piece of shit. Thank you OWI for killing your favorite game. I do not recommend buying!"
"I just returned to squad after a year and half hiatus.

can't aim, takes literally 5 min for the screen to become un-blurry after being suppressed for 1 second, running has somehow turned into powerwalking??  and forget trying to aim after just moving forward without ""running"" for a little while.

I target & comp shoot in real life with rifles and pistols and the ico or whatever it is they implemented no way reflects how it feels IRL, it is a really horrible system that just makes me extremely frustrated considering ik 70 year olds who can shoot on the move after running and hold it 10x steadier than how its portrayed in game. these arn't meant to be regular civies with no training in combat but actual trained infantry etc but the devs have seemed to make it so they have the discipline of a 8 yearold child trying to hold up a barret.

after holding out and hoping that after 7 games in a row it would get better, it has not. the game is unplayable for me, its a real shame that i cannot recommend this game to anyone, especially since it used to be my favourite tactical infantry shooter."
"IF you love to run around for hours only to be shot by someone you never see or has crazy good accuracy, This is the game for you. Its fun to be with people and try to go around and play as a group but the cheats are to obvious and no way to actually report cheaters. So basically a fun game until you are completely over the bullshit."
This ICO is terrible -1
Honestly a tad too messed up for my taste. Would appreciate some more thought to be put in the game.
"I'm far too antisocial for something that requires this much communication. I also found the controls too complex, never even got around to finishing the tutorial due to the amount of keys on the keyboard necessary to play. I'd need a flashcard with the controls taped to my screen to play this."
"infantry is shit, cant aim for nothing, was good when it had playable infantry but after the update i have a fucking soldier who has never held a gun in his life"
Personally I cant get into it unlike other war games. Community is hard to get along with and the game is just not as fun as arma or hell let loose.
game keeps crashing
"The game relies heavily on teamwork, and communication plays a big role. It's as much of a military role-playing game as it is a shooter. You'll need to find a proper community to enjoy this game, and pray that there's enough slots in the servers you enjoy. 

It's a very odd game, and I can't recommend it as it simply isn't fun without an active team - which is hard to find the majority of the time."
been multiple years yet they have not fixed the biggest issue wich is the horrible servers cant even join a game anymore server browser dosent work and pressing the play button or whatever it is dosent work devs cant make infantry good if their life depended on it.
roblox better
"I hate that my game character can barely handle a weapon after doing a light jog, its like they arent even trained to handle a gun."
They introduced a bug that does not allow your courser to lock to the game.
finding english is hard and u cant rely on yankie noodles to be good at the game. u need some single player or ranked modes
"With the changes to thee game over the past few months the game has started to feel like everything is against you. It genuinely feels like youre a child conscript thats never fired a weapon. Its somewhat sucked the enjoyment out of the game, a game i used to truely love. Bring back the old systems which were balanced and made sense for a game!"
"It's exactly the bf2 vibe I was searching for. However, crashes happen frequently. Unplayable. despite having 3050 Ti, i7 12-gen.
Since the game cannot be played, what is the purpose of buying it? Most of the players are facing this issue. They haven't fixed it yet. 
Because of the gameplay, I would most definitely suggest it. However, at this point, I just simply cannot."
"Absolutely terrible community. Joined a few beginner lobbies and got screamed at for not knowing what to do, and kicked from the squad for not doing exactly what the squad lead wanted 24/7. Was told to watch a few dozen hours of game-play and practice by myself for a few hours before trying to play online"
"ICO was nice in theory, optimization continually got worse over time, and now the game gives you more sway the lower your fps is. I.E if you have a firefight, or anything more than standing still shooting at eachother in an empty field, good luck hitting anything when your fps drops under 60 and suddenly your trained professional soldier is an intoxicated toddler trying to steady a triple pendulum to hit someone at 10 yards.

Why is scope sway tied to FPS? ask owi"
"I am applaud that the system requirements are straight up BS. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! MAKE SURE YOU SURPASS THE RECOMMENDED REQUIREMENTS. When the round starts I hit 80-90 FPS, then when you reach the objective sites my lord the frame rate takes a HUGE HIT. Stop misleading your customers Off world. Biggest waste of 30 bucks I have ever spent."
"4000 hours here
pros: nice community 
cons:
-huge ongoing controversy about gunplay and recoil affected by fps
-very bad performance issues on all hardware despite being an ancient game
-no destruction at all, nada, even tank shells dont' leave any marks
-aged graphics, no dynamic lightning
-lack of details and variety, most buildings are completely empty and are just boxes, 10 story buildings with all floors exactly the same
-bad vehicle physics will be a regular part of your gameplay, clumsy driving and stuck vehicles
-lots of unadressed bugs that players constantly face"
owi ruined this game with this stupid gunplay update it used to be fun leave it up to them to just completely f stuff up
The Gunplay is Horrible
"Its a nice game except the gunplay, its legit the worst.
 I dunno what kind of noodle arms my guy has but its embarrasing.
Since the gunplay is like the majoriry of the game i cant recommend it lol."
Worse version of Hell Let Loose
"I played Squad for years now, maybe more than half a decade or less, i forgot. and have had countless matches. At some point, I even no-lifed this game out of boredom. I like this game, because it reminds me of what PR could have been. However, I will never recommend getting this game in its current state.

1- Squad is heavily reliant on teamwork, communication and patience. Each match is determined by the SLs that guide their teammates and the careful placement of assets(HABs, vehicles and such). However, because of the new wave of new players, and the waves of veterans(players who played for a while) leaving, Squad currently has worse teamwork and communication than CSGO. Some servers will be better than others, but ultimately after a specific time has passed, only new players are left. People forget to give callouts, forget how to place a hab, forget how to defend or how to attack. People misuse vehicles and their purposes, and leave 1-1.5hr matches being a frustrating, chaotic mess. 

2-Armor squads. I just hate them, an elitist group of people who think they are better than others, with the most arrogant, narcissistic personalities. Some of them are cool, depending on what server, and some of them are just too voodoo for this. I fucking hate buji too.

3-Chinese faction and how OP it is compared to the rest. Theres no denying that there is bias, like how the Chinese ATGM can reload faster than all other tows, or how the ZTZ has the tiniest weakspots, or how the Chinese HAT kit has a laser rangefinder and multipurpose ammunition. The Chinese amphibious logi has the most capacity in game, and their vehicles are the smoothest to control. Their APCs are tanky, and in some layers they have more vehicles than others.

4-Faction voting. It is possibly the worst thing second to the ICO. Players now only choose armor factions, and it always becomes a formula of (TANK V TANK, TANK V SUPPORT). Or, players only choose meta factions, like USMC v VDV or USA v RUS.. Rarely do players choose insurgent, or militia, or other factions. Always meta armor factions. This is of course subjective to servers, but I digress. 

5- ICO. ICO has ruined it all for me, and has made the game an RNG shooter. People will argue to just wait and shoot, but even if I do, hitting the enemy will not always kill them. People are still bullet sponges, and the inability to hit straight has made firefights ever so random, and ever so frustrating. At some times, I have hip fired people from point blank, and because of the randomness of the shooting, my bullets quite literally went everywhere but the intended target. The suppression system is fine, but the way everything else plays out makes this game a chaotic mess. Add this with the new wave of players, and you have a chaotic game, chaotic command chat, misplaced HABs and you dont even get the ability to fight back properly. No way do weapons behave like this in real life, and this isnt even an attempt to make firefights realistic, it is an attempt to sabotage years of playing to give way to new players. While yes, players shouldnt be able to hit a moving target consistently at 200-300m, they should atleast be able to do that at 50-100m! But people cant, because the way is random, and unbearable. There is even evidence to suggest that the less framerates, the more sway you get. SO, people with beast PCs will always outplay others, because of less sway. 

7-Game physics. Cars will fly, or flip on the smallest bumps. Tanks will bounce when hitting rocks, and flip upside down. Cars drift around in the desert, as if there isnt friction. Cars or tanks cant climb hills, as if torque doesnt exist.

8-OWI does not care. And yes, I am calling out the company out of frustration, but OWI has fumbled it by trying to get more buyers than to keep a dedicated community. We have lost hundreds or thousands of players purely because of greed and because of mismanagement. We have lost a dedicated community of veterans who put years into this game, and for what? For a few clicks? Content creators will swear that the game is doing better than it was, and it is a LIE. The game is in a worse state, and it needs better work. It needs to revert some changes, or heavily change them. 

Overall, the game currently is as it goes: Matches are a chaotic mess of miscommunication, misplacement of assets, new players unable to form a coherent force, and a gunplay system that is based on a coin flip.
I will keep playing this game, because i like it and want to see it become better, but it has been a decline since V12 and things appear to be the same for the foreseeable future.

Also, armor players are liars. You dont need a beast PC to claim vehicles, you just need to do:
CreateSquad ""squadname"" 1
Good luck."
this shit is garbage lmao
"-Team kill because you cant figure out who is enemy
-Get screamed at
-Yell back
-Get kicked
-Play another game
-Die over and over because everyone looks the same and you have no clue who is on your team
-Never with squad since they keep abandoning me
-Uninstall"
Somehow I got same vibes again than years ago. I guess its stolen project and even modified so badly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR9wHeI8010
"Worst combat game i have ever played. Its way too hard, annoying to have to run for 30 min, never hit a single shot because the crossair is moving constantly. And now since i have played the entire weekend i CANNOT FUCKING RETURN IT. Worst 40 dollar waste EVER!"
star wars mod cool game bad
game is fuckin gay and for niggers
A lot of Russians
IDK what the fuck these devs were thinking drastically changing a game thats been out for so long... Gunplay isnt even a slight bit satisfying anymore. they force you too lay prone and not advance they just took their vision and ruined a game just like all these arrogant devs that dont listen to their communities.
I want to love it but its bugged and poorly optimized. Also hardly anyone wants to work together like intended.
"game feels clunky, doesn't run all that well and the gun play is horrible. takes forever for your character to aim straight. gameplay is pretty boring in general. if you're unlucky you're stuck in a squad thats just camping somewhere for 20 mins. realistic? maybe. boring? yes."
"I just learned that there is a bug in the game that makes your aim much harder if your FPS is low. I'm playing on an old computer and thought that I was getting killed a lot because I was not skilled, but now I know that it's mostly because the other players have an extreme and disproportionate advantage due to their more expensive hardware.

This is also the reason why some players hated the infantry combat update, and some loved it. It gave unfair advantages to some, and unfair disadvantages to the rest.

This problem is caused by the unfortunate tendency of game devs developing on extremely high performance hardware, and as such will not detect bugs they introduce on a typical user's machine.

EDIT: They eventually fixed the FPS bug, but there are so many other bugs that I cannot recommend this game. The devs don't seem to be able to fix one issue without causing two other issues. The ICO update which created the FPS sway bug was supposed to prevent people from doing weird non-immersive things like ""jiggly-peeking"" and 360 noscope headshots like you see in other unrealistic shooters, but it didn't even fix that because you can still jiggly peek, standing upright, from behind a tree and shoot someone who is lying down 150 meters away from you, pinning you down. Maybe some other dev team will be able to fix this age-old issue with shooters."
"It was good until it got fucked into oblivion with the ""ICO"" AKA Infantry Combat Overhaul. And by overhaul they made soldiers handle recoil worse than a 5 year old. 
The die hards who couldn't even aim in the first place will cry ""Skill Issue"" as though that's somehow relevant to the fact that, you can't fire 3 bullets, without your gun almost fish tailing out of your hands.
I had a lot of fun with the game, but now it's just unfun garbage."
pice of shit game
"As an experienced player of ""Squad"" on Steam, I've had the opportunity to delve deep into the intricacies of this tactical shooter. Developed by Offworld Industries, Squad is a first-person shooter that places a heavy emphasis on teamwork, communication, and realistic military tactics. Having spent countless hours immersed in its intense and demanding gameplay, I can confidently say that Squad stands out in the crowded FPS market for its commitment to authenticity and its ability to deliver a truly collaborative experience.

Realism and Immersion

One of the first things that struck me about Squad is its dedication to realism. The graphics are stunning, with detailed environments ranging from dense forests to sprawling urban landscapes. The sound design is equally impressive, capturing the cacophony of battle with precision. Bullets whiz past your ears, explosions rock the terrain, and the distant chatter of your squadmates on the radio all contribute to an unparalleled level of immersion.

The gameplay mechanics are meticulously crafted to mirror real-world military operations. Movement is deliberate and weighty, making every action feel consequential. This game does not cater to lone wolves; success hinges on effective communication and coordination with your team. The learning curve is steep, but it's this challenge that makes each victory so rewarding.

Teamwork and Communication

The essence of Squad lies in its emphasis on teamwork. Each match consists of two teams, each with up to 50 players, working together to achieve their objectives. Within these teams, players are divided into smaller squads, each led by a squad leader who coordinates with other squads and the overall team commander. This hierarchical structure fosters a sense of organization and strategy that is rarely seen in other FPS games.

Communication is vital. The game features an in-game voice chat system that includes squad chat, local chat, and command chat, allowing for seamless communication at all levels of the team. The need for constant communication ensures that players are always engaged and working together. Whether calling out enemy positions, coordinating an assault, or requesting supplies, every voice counts. As someone who enjoys the strategic depth of military operations, this aspect of Squad is incredibly satisfying.

Strategic Depth

Squad's strategic depth is what keeps me coming back. The game features a wide array of vehicles, from transport trucks to armored tanks, each requiring a coordinated effort to operate effectively. Building and maintaining forward operating bases (FOBs) is another key aspect of gameplay, adding a layer of logistical strategy. The maps are vast and varied, offering numerous tactical possibilities and encouraging players to think critically about their approach to each objective.

The game constantly challenges you to adapt and refine your strategies. Whether you’re planning a stealthy infiltration, setting up ambushes, or managing resources for your squad, the strategic elements of Squad keep the gameplay fresh and engaging.

Community and Updates

The community in Squad is one of its strongest assets. Players are generally cooperative and willing to teach newcomers the ropes. This welcoming atmosphere is a testament to the game's design, which rewards teamwork and punishes selfish playstyles. Offworld Industries also deserves praise for their commitment to supporting and expanding the game. Regular updates introduce new content, balance changes, and bug fixes, ensuring that Squad continues to evolve and improve.

Conclusion

In conclusion, Squad is a standout title in the tactical shooter genre. Its commitment to realism, emphasis on teamwork, and strategic depth make it a must-play for fans of military simulations. As a seasoned player, I find the game’s rewarding and immersive experience well worth the effort. For those seeking a game that challenges their tactical thinking and teamwork skills, Squad on Steam is an excellent choice. However, it’s important to note that recent changes to the gun mechanics have been disappointing. The shooting mechanics used to be much better, and this downgrade has significantly impacted my enjoyment of the game. Because of this, I have to give Squad a negative review. The developers need to address these issues to restore the game's former glory."
"Man I really used to love this game. The community is actually pretty great, gameplay is beyond fun. It looks gorgeous, and the sound scape and suppression system is another level. But I just cant stand these PiP scopes with the new combat overhaul. The game used to run so smooth and now it feels pretty janky most of the time, and adjusting my settings doesn't seem to help much. A 5950x and 3070ti should still be enough. Seems the devs have tried to add too much into the game without optimizing it properly. Right now, Squad44 seems to scratch the itch a lot better if i can get into a match. So i'm glad they are putting effort into that title. They need to go back to their roots with this game for me to recommend it anymore."
"Typical modern military shooter, oversized install size, terrible net code and broken promises. Cash shop is of course the only thing that runs at a decent frame rate."
game needs optimisation
"I would like to recommend the game but can't. 
It's command-base PvP but many players play it like BF or CoD.
When squads really communicate you really enjoy. But it happens very rare"
"Poorly implemented good idea - toxic community (big surprise) - Basic training doesn't provide enough of a tutorial to navigate the game mechanics in it's entirety - get ready to be amazed by the realism of not knowing what the fuck you're doing on a battlefield.  Played for 10 hours, never once understood how I died.  People using terms and phrases that aren't explained unless you ask and then people get upset when they have to explain.  What would make this game fun?  Single player mode."
10/10
trash optimization
Game is wack. Toxic wannabe sargent players make it worse. Rather play Battlefield or Arma.
"I REALLY want to love this game! its such a good mass warfare style game. the main problems I have with it are the PING system, why on earth not everyone can make pings is INSANE to me, now the first argument to that is ""the map will be covered"" well make them squad only pings and then SL pings, not hard to do, but the fact that I HAVE to make fire-team leaders so they can ping things is again INSANE, as infantry its AWESOME{/S} that i have to yell ""over there, like 275, next to that rock"" is fucking crazy... instead of just a single ping that fades withing 5 to 15 seconds. like what the actual fuck. second thing is the name badges, or icons above friendlies heads. who thought it was a good idea to have them show for .05s and then disappear again is fucking crazy, I spent so much mental effort making sure I see an actual enemy compared to a friendly it makes me not even want to play, It's hard enough to see the enemy now i have to double check they are in fact the enemy. why not have perm icons or at least show up BRIGHT when i literally AIM at a friendly is fucking crazy... hell let loose does this perfectly and doesn't detract from game play whatsoever.. those are 2 things I would LOVE address and make this a more enjoyable experience."
This fkin game is crashing every 10-15 minutes. Tried every possible fix and nothing works. Fck this broke ass game.
"I wish the developers could change the game engine, the current engine is out of date and bugs caused by the engine are all over the game. 

We need a better engine so the vehicles won't be flipped at the very start of the game, a tree won't be completely fine after a 70 ton MBT crash on it, the terrain won't remain the same after being bombed by heavy artillery fire. And most importantly, the leaves and textures won't be flashing, killing my eyes and GPU. 

We need enhanced graphics performance, more realistic physics engine and better optimization."
"post ICO squad = juice not worth the squeeze.  Old good squad is dead, go play another shooter.  The player base here is just as brain dead post ICO as it was pre ICO.  just now all the good players left."
Worst fucking game ever cant even play tries to join a squad and they all just kick you cause there to busy kissing each other then tries to make your own and get told fucking no not to mention the gunplay is the worst ive ever fucking seen
"I've been playing Squad for a while now (nearly 400 hours), and there are some standout aspects that I really appreciate. The emphasis on teamwork and communication is where this game truly shines. Every match requires coordination and strategy, making it a fantastic experience for those who enjoy working closely with their team. The game's design encourages players to communicate and cooperate, which leads to a sense of camaraderie and shared accomplishment that few other games can match.

However, when it comes to the gunplay, Squad falls short of my expectations. The mechanics feel clunky and lack the realism one would expect from a military simulation game. The shooting experience doesn't have the weight and precision that you find in other games within the genre, which can be quite frustrating, especially during intense firefights.

In summary, if you value teamwork and communication in your gaming experience, Squad is definitely worth trying. Just be prepared for a less-than-realistic gunplay experience that might detract from the overall immersion"
only cucks play this game...
i dont have sound for the game i heave tried diffrent thangs and sound will come on for a match then go back out.
"Old gunplay was wayyyyyyy better.

A 8 year old could handle a ar better then these ""Trained Operators""

Waste Of Money"
had to uninstall. not as fun
Picture in picture scopes look cool but absolutely tank your frames. Really really stupid.
Scope update blows.
This is easily one of the worst fps games I have ever played.
The modded servers with Russia against Ukrainians and islam  vs Israel is steadly ruining this game. Its dumping politics and so much hate speech into the game that I just want to enjoy. I get it there are world conflicts being portrayed but I would love to stop hearing about how everyone wants to kill jews. Its game for gods sake and more and more servers are just this.
gunplay is just bad using anything like rpg is ganne take 5 seconds so if a bmp is rushing you well youre fucked vechile combat is even more boring game consist of dying to somthing you dint see or somthing you cant stop
keeps crashing ue4 error every time i trie and load into a game but is fine in the main menu
"You are a trained soldier yet can only run for 3 seconds, slow as hell, and when you try to ADS your bones are like rubber. Full auto is somehow more accurate and when dumping a full mag into someone you die."
"ICO killed the game, worst gunplay ever after the freaking update"
"Game uses Easy Anti Cheat that creates problems on top of an already buggy and broken server browser. Seems like it doesn't cause issues for some people, but breaks the game for others like me. Unless you want to roll the dice to see if the game will permanently break for you, steer clear."
"The game feels terrible to play, movement and gunplay always feels like ass, and most servers boil down to ""run for 10 minutes, die to a guy you couldn't see, repeat.""
Partly skill issue sure- but HLL & Battle-bit both at least make it fun in their own ways. Not to mention the hundred other small pains the game has."
"Great game if you're in to tactical shooters. Too bada it's so badly optimized that it's have become a meme in the community. You wan't to play with 60+ fps stable? Just forget it, the game turns in to a slide show when ever it feels like it... Sometimes it works allright and other times you can't play at all."
"cant hit 60fps on this games with a 2080 after the ICO. Dont buy this shitty game unless you want your character to sway their gun for 10 seconds before being able to stabalize and take an accurate shot. Fucking noodle arms. And dont remind me of how shit they have made the stamina. You run for 10 seconds, you recover for 20. Pathetic game unless you have a 40 series card ffs"
meh
lowkey it says 80-90 gig download but that shit like 150 gigs at least lmao literally just deleted every game to download it and it used over 160 gigs and i have 40 gigs left and it still does not run lol not worth dont buy dlc are like 30gigs each too only buy if you got a terribite at least
"I never used to play squad as a run and gun, snap shooting game but the ICO has made infantry effectiveness terrible. Having trained soldiers that cant hold a gun steady to quite literally save their life after a 10 second run to cover is just stupid. Even with full stamina playing slowly, if you come face to face with an enemy the gunfight is just pure luck as to who's shots are going to land due to the fact that if you aim down sight your retical isnt even in the picture after the 2nd or 3rd shot and the hipfire accuracy is abysmal. Only time i have fun with infantry now is with MG's or marksmen where you can overwatch with a bipod so you can take effective shots without your gun going all over the place. If you contest any of the ICO changes you're told its a skill issue or ""go play COD"", overall i still play the game consistently because i love the teamwork and community play style even with the terrible game optimization but major changes need to be made to infantry to make it even somewhat viable without having to just meat grind your way onto objectives. OWI needs to listen to their community instead of bribing positive reviews and adding unnecessary micro transactions."
I am not good at it
"The game died when v5 ended. The insane suppression, inertia, physical inability of the players character and lack of any devs with military experience has led to a walking suppression simulator which is completely unplayable and neither realistic or functional compared to its previous renditions. Turns out that v6 is what killed this game off. You cant even hold the scope still with a bipod and in the prone ffs. All it takes is one vehicle with a 50 cal to make an entire compound unplayable for those defending it. Oh and they think 120mm mortar makes the ground have a 5 magnitude earthquake from 300+m away..."
Not bringing ranking system kills the game mentality and ruins whole game because of Squad Leaders that have no idea what they are doing.
You are playing as young military boy with noodle arms. Gunfire gameplay is just garbage.
"Really hard game to get into, complex and many players don't want noobs in their squads so hard to get into it....

Much more fun watching videos on YT of it than playing it..."
Hostile player base.
"Do not waste your money,I asked for a refund and told since I played it more then 2 hrs no refund. This is after multiple times sending crash reports from day one to them. I was able to get on one server one time for 15 min. More then 2 hrs on training is what they are talking about and I'm sure they see that."
not that good
Can not aim or shoot to much sensitivity. Fix the game! Combat Overhaul update ruined the game.
This game is so brain numbing it's crazy low-key a waste of 50 Euros
Can`t play the Taliban. shit game
No
"it has still some technical issue ,"
"After years of loving this game. All has been undone with the Infantry Combat Overhaul update.  Since the patch I have found myself not able to like playing the game how i used to. The slow nature of the game has been brought to a new level of slow encouraging a play style I simply do not like.  I understand that they love realism. But its just taken a little too far and takes away from the experience. Not being able to simply aim down your weapon and attempt to shoot someone after walking for 5 minutes in a shooter is an actual piss take. Once a beloved game now will sit uninstalled in my library until changes are made. Please revert the combat overhaul, or at the very least the ADS changes."
does anyone else have the problem of endless loading while trying to boot up the game. haven't even been able to play the game yet.
Infantry Combat Overhaul making it so your character can't keep a rifle steady on a man-sized target at 25m is asinine. I understand wanting to make the game slower but having a wacky wavy inflatable arm tube man as a trained soldier is absolutely ridiculous.
Wont work with Bluetooth headsets and the UI for maps and squad leaders is terrible
this used to be the best fps on the market by a country mile. But now is filled with hackers or people who have a 3090 outputting 720p quality so they can see you move in a bush that is not on their screen. let alone the amount of children or just plain dumb people who play this game without a mic or look to wonder around like its a open world adventure game.
british people have rights on this
"noone wants to squad lead and constantly squad seed leaving new players as SL who don't even want it or know how to play it. Community is subpar, tbh."
You can not tell who is who until you learn all of the uniforms this sucks because most engagements happen at long range. Slow pace with no rewards or feedback when  you kill an enemy or revive friendly. Fun community but terrible game design outside of the mechanics.  Not a good came for casual gamer.
A large problem with this game is the community. extremely toxic community and most importantly toxic mods
"This game use to be soo good but i feel like the ruined it a few updates ago. The hip fire was never good in this game, but now scoping in with any type of optic takes forever and is extremely blurry. Whatever they did to the ADS and optics ruined the combat experience in my opinion. A couple years ago it was much better"
This game failes to work with xbox headset microphone when audio communication is core gameplay necessity. Bug is long known but newer fixed.
very bad stuttering and fps issues
"I cannot recommend the game at its curent state. 
Have been playing this game for a little over six years now and accumulated 2600+ hours in game.
Still wish Operation First Light would be in the game...

The ""recent"" Infantry Combat Overhaul really - REALLY - destroyed the game for me.
It favours bush wookies instead of aggresive infantry gameplay. It's not tactical, it's just lame.
It's a game at the end of the day and it should be fun. Squad is NOT milsim like Arma and it shouldn't try to be.
It's infuriating sprinting for 10 seconds and having to wait another 10 until your character's noodle arms stop swinging like a freaking car dealership air dancer. Eventually you take the shot but even if it's a headshot there's a 50% the enemy will survive.

Also removing the dead-dead status some years ago was a bad decision imo. It just encourages players to run around like headless chickens without fearing for punishment for doing so. Now THAT was much better at slowing down the game's pace without that noodle arm bullcrap.

Now whoever's been playing this game know optimization is just terrible. It still feels like an early access game, although it's being developed for almost 10 years now.
Game also doesn't look great. Some maps have been revamped (aka added some bushes and trees) and are kinda ok, but after a while they tend to get repetitive. 

There are a couple good things about the ""game"":
1. Its community. There are several clans that have been around for ages now and without them populating the servers the game would've been dead by now. 
2. The mods created by said community. Some mods allow you to play with the ""old"" infantry mechanics so you can actually have fun. Through what were originally mods, new factions, vehicles, guns have been added to the game. Don't think OWI would've ever come that far without these mods.

This game is only still around because there is no competition at the moment.
I hope that changes soon, same as happened to Tarkov with Gray Zone and Arena Breakout."
I don't understand why this game is so popular; is it because all the other games suck more?
very slow paced game
textures doesn't load properly
no
"Kinda runs like actual shit, they fixed some of the issues but one guy tosses a smoke or something blows up and even on a next gen rig ur fps dumps, stupid asf, optimize your goddamn game"
its not good
i dont know who is mine teammate...bade game. rip
Do not buy this game unless you have a 10K computer to run it. Even the game looks horrible on DLSS mode or even having the anti aliasing on. I don't know what the developers have been smoking the past few months that I was off from this game. But my god is the game unplayable.
Need to be a pro gamer to enjoy this game
"You play like a toddler with a gun with the aim and recoil.
Global escalation mod helps but it's a 50/50 if you get an incompetent team or half the tickets being drained by friendly fire."
"Game used to be good a year ago, when it was a little more arcady, the developers are wrongfuly going into a super realistic milsim direction guided by a very loud minority part of the community, taking all the fun the game used to have, i don't want to be opening my map to check if someone is a foe or not, and i don't want to memorize every faction's camo, this is becoming a running simulator and team kill simulator instead of an actual war game."
I GOT FUCKING BANNED FOR TEAMKILLING
optimization
no
"Buyer beware, if your looking for a way to waste two hours of your life, have little to poor piss communication, to players griefing, trolling, or even hacking, with server admins being to non existing, and with no teamwork that the game is solely about. Then you have found the right game to waste your money and to give devs money that they never will use to work on the game. Welcome to the squad, get your refund back within the steam policy to get your money back."
strict no fun policy
"Подавление хуета конченная, неиграбельно"
"Fix optimization and I will change my vote. Helldivers 2 community did it, we can too. 
This is for the benefit of the players and for the game. I love it, but I must do it."
Dogshit ass community lol don't waste your time
unrealistic mechanics and waste of money
"Bought the game couple of years ago and finally gave it a go

Stamina is very punishing and gun handling is very atrocious

As if the dev team wanted to make a milsim but had zero clue so they just dumped whatever idea they had without any balancing

I don't recommend Squad to anyone unless you like to stare at shaky trash which you could find free trash and shake it in front of your face without having to pay for anything"
only buy if u dont care about getting 40 fps
"BAD OPTIMIZATION!!! SHOULD GAIN MORE FPS ON LOW VIDEO AND FOV
CANT SEE ALLY OR ENEMIES AT ALL!!!!  u dont know who is who.
Should have hover and instantly show player's name with out delaying animation"
"Good game, fun to play, and intensive gameplay. Problems? Squad leader acts like a baby and kicks you out without any reason or if you choose their favorite kit. They are brainless crying kids who cant play with the selected kit. And the game does not allow you to play without being in a squad which is even dumbest thing in this game. Add bot support for single player mode like you did for Project Reality"
add sex pls
Obligatory bad review for trading screenshots for good reviews lol wtf does anyone want screenshots for
Offworld has ruined this game with the new team and map voting!!
хуета для долбаёбов
"The infantry overhaul really crushed this game.

I understand their intent but after giving it more than a few hours since the change it is safe to say it did not achieve its desired effect. Instead of changing infantry behavior it has caused the player base to abandon infantry in favor of armor or air assets.

Can no longer recommend this game to my friends and rarely find myself playing anything other than the community mods.

They really shot themselves in the foot with this one."
worlds worst gunplay award goes to squad now!
"servers are too sensitive, if you write ""nades in this game are retarded"" you will get banned...how sensitive the world has become...dont be a pussy"
aint no way anyone plays this and enjoys it by far worst game i have ever played. Names of the players dont show or barely show. The enemy sees you wellllllllll before you see them even when scouting and looking through binos full scan of the area you still get killed while being concealed. the mechanics suck ass. feels like i fill them with lead at head and chest shots and they dont drop im shot one time and im instantly kia
Meh. The game could be fun at times and very boring other times. Good servers are full and bad ones are not fun and full of people not taking the game seriously. I haven't played this in a long time simply because of long waiting times in servers around my location.
Ever since they changed the aiming mechanics game is clunky and bad... so sad
not worth it keeps crashing
lame ass game
Game has unacceptably poor optimization. Can barely hit 30 FPS on some maps with a 3060ti on low.
awful game
Got highs of 8 FPS lows of 1 and normal range of 3-5. What.
"[h1][b]""Squad: Ambitious Tactics Marred by Community Management""[/b][/h1]

[h2][b]Overall Score: 40 Cans of Horse Meat[/b][/h2]

[h2]Introduction[/h2]
Squad aims to revolutionize the tactical shooter genre with its 100-player battles featuring modern weaponry and complex team strategies. As I navigate the battlefield of this review, let’s be clear—I am as straightforward in my judgments as the game is ambitious in its design.

[h2]Graphics - 6 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: The visuals in Squad are competent, supporting the immersion of a modern combat environment. However, the recent updates have introduced control issues that detract from the experience, tipping the balance unfavorably for players who adhere to the rules.

[h2]Gameplay - 3 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: While Squad’s gameplay promises complex coordination and large-scale battles, the clunky mechanics and recent control issues significantly undermine its playability. This reduction reflects the growing frustration among players.

[h2]Sound/Music - 7 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: The sound design is a strong point, with realistic audio cues that enhance tactical decisions and add depth to the combat experience.

[h2]Replayability - 3 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: The potential for varied and dynamic gameplay is overshadowed by pervasive issues with community management and server inconsistency, severely affecting the desire to replay.

[h2]Performance - 4 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: Performance varies significantly across different servers, particularly due to unofficial modifications that can impact gameplay smoothness and fairness.

[h2]Content Volume - 4 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: While Squad offers a variety of maps and units, the actual enjoyment of this content is frequently compromised by the game’s broader issues, reducing its overall appeal.

[h2]Multiplayer - 3 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: Although multiplayer is the core of Squad, the experience is marred by a lack of official servers and the problematic behavior of certain server admins. The existence of a blacklist controlled by these admins creates an oppressive environment where fairness is often disregarded.

[h2]Innovation - 8 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: The game’s concept and scale are highly innovative, attempting to set a new standard in tactical gameplay. However, the execution is flawed, particularly in how the community is managed.

[h2]Value for Money - 2 Cans of Horse Meat[/h2]
[b]Summary[/b]: Given the potential frustration and barriers to consistent enjoyment caused by community management issues, the game might not represent good value for all players, especially those unwilling to navigate the complexities of its multiplayer environment.

[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
With an overall score of 40 cans of horse meat, Squad offers a glimpse of what could be a revolutionary step in tactical shooters but ultimately falls short due to significant community management issues. The game demands not only tactical skill but also a high tolerance for community-driven governance, which can detract from the overall experience. As I end this review, I stand as committed to fair play and honest critique as I am clear about my own orientation—firmly not gay."
Explicably unpopular. Even after seeing what it has to offer
"A very slow paced, clunky and boring shooter."
"Gunplay and movement are terrible, you're constantly struggling to keep your crosshair where you want it to be. Older and therefore slower gamers love this because it adds ""realism"" and gives them a chance against more skillful aimers. You have to be prone in a bush for 15 seconds for your aim to stabilize. If you like this, I can recommend this game, but for me its the worst part of it."
What a waste of money for a run until you get shot simulator. this isnt milsim so stop trying so hard to be so.
"This game is somehow too realistic to be a fun casual shooter experience, but also not realistic enough to make for a complex and engaging simulator game. It's weird."
game updates and i cant play it when it was working fine before the update
"leans too much towards simulation for my tastes.  The maps are very large, takes a while to get where you are going and your enemy encounters are few and far between.  When you do make contact it is almost always from great distances, leaving you to squint while shooting at little tiny soldiers through your scope that are only a couple of pixels in size.  More likely than not you'll get shot before you see anybody no matter what you do.  I don't see the appeal."
was good before
"Realistic war styled shooter done nicely, might be a bit slow and clunky in some part but overall nice TEAM (squad) player game.
Now then, remember that ""TEAM""(squad) part? yeah thats 80% of the time some bullshit and i mean bullshit like the whole shit bag out of that poor ass bull. Private servers hooray! what a shit-fest... youll basically enter a game just to see 5 - 9 locked squads cause fuck it why play and allow TEAM play in TEAM game - also... private servers setup just allow that even more... sweaty ass-fingered admins are as usefull as my right nut and boy does it hang low. 
All those private servers, discord servers, admins in a team based game... are amounting to a perfect 0...
Nice concept of a game, execution ruined by community.

"uniforms for both teams tend to be almost exactly the same and its very hard to distinguish between your team and the others. Players have a constant discussion about gay tendencies. Squad leads don't have tolerance for beginners and ask if you can find another squad, They honestly believe this to be real and not just a game. Got a refund."
this game is so fun but its unplayable bc of how broken the game is dont buy this pos. FIX YOUR SHIT
too many bugs yet n is extremely hard. inputs are way too lagish
my friends like it
Queue simulator
Unoptimized game.
"The game has a lot of bugs. Also, players cannot make a squad before the game starts. Do not support Steam friends.
Do not support training with teammates. Cant change FOV when a player is a helicopter pilot. You can't mute the plyaers in a lobby after the match is over. There was a small part problesm it this game."
"Fos drops and stuttering, im done"
Leak this Hoss.
this game is boring play arma instead
"Saw that they were bribing people for positive reviews here so this is my first review of the game:

Yikes"
"The best part about the game is its game speed and match flow. Very rewarding to sit back and take your time with your team and pick off randoms that dont work together (if played slow and tactical). Teamwork is very balanced. Great suppression mechanics. Good amount of vehicles although missing a lot of tactics and strategy that is used with modern technology. (press w with boots or wheels and commander gets a UAV and Arty every 20 mins); vanilla tactics. 

The worst part about the game is that grass unrenders after 300 meters so defenders can see attackers clear as day, but attackers cant see 2 feet in front of them when prone. Community combat awareness IQ is very low and hurts the experience even for someone who is mildly trying to play (Find friends for consistent enjoyment). No building destruction. Lack of player movement ability (cant peak over cover have to stand and expose oneself...) Graphics are very hard to look at when there is a lot of foilage. Player seems to stick to trees and building if you rub up against them. Not uncommon for player and vehicles to get stuck inside of a tree (vics have a low chance of getting out of them, players can prone spam out). Major flaws hurt it alot. Still traces of being a beta.

Personal Remarks: Adding the ability to dig into the ground and alter brush/foilage with e tool (also lack of thick brush, all bushes on all maps have same spacing). Commander needs more strategical things to do. 100v100 someday? 50v50 is unrealistic personel for the size of some of the maps. Provide more structure to the organization of teams. When making a squad, allow leaders to mark there squad as ""logi"" or ""recon"" or ""transport"" or ""QRF"". Open players eyes about the possibilities in-game instead of on the loading screen. Free will is only good when players know what they can do with it.

Finally there should be an accolade system of some sort. Militaries all over the world are all about giving medals and ribbons. Incentivize the player to play well, theres no positive reinforcement for good play and i think that is what ruins matches sometimes... nobody cares. Maybe since a player stays within a 400ish meter radius of their squad leader they have a good rating in that catagory that adds up to an overall rating. Maybe somones profile just has a type of Medal of Honor for that faction they were playing when they earned it because the game can track them pulling multiple downed teammates away from a burning logi truck under suppression or a squad leader is 9v37 in a certain grid square with his green triangles for 10 minutes because he understands how to win in battle. Thats what I would like to see. When I get on this game all i see is my 2k hours played and nothing in game to show for it. Promote good play!"
Infantry combat overhaul made this so much less fun to play. They made shooting guns a struggle and your character sucks at aiming. If you see someone you better be ready to wait 20 seconds before you aim to regain stamina
cheap arma clone
The old aiming system was better and why are weapon skins and emotes in a milsim?
Not my style tbh
"not recomended for indonesian player, cuz there arnt many server available"
"Infantry overhaul made this game so entirely not fun to play, might come back if they roll it back or someone mods it into its previous state"
"Terrible gun mechanics after the latest ADS and recoil change, you're better off playing Arma."
"Military role play X
Stupid pp and low IQ / game sense pp role play  O"
Really boring and graphics arent as good as i thought they might be.  This is an opinion
"fun game but the performance is something that really bugs me, alot"
the physics engine in this game is complete crap. I advise the developers of this mess to go back to school
ICO is meh
Game keeps fucking crashing and the devs are bribing people for positive reviews. I honestly only play this game for galactic contention.
Game was great until I heard an NZ accent over the radio. Uninstalled.
Recent updates have made the game too slow and not fun to play anymore. Everyone has left. Come back when they fix it.
Players get way into role play that they will kick you from squads if you don't listen
ew
"I know this is more like me issue, but the game often crash, either that or the game wont render correctly, the texture looks like a playdough. when the game launch correctly, i spend most time just looking for a server, and waiting on the queue. if you are a european or american, have decent pc, and enjoy milsim game, this is for you. you got no probs. if you are south east asian, dont have decent pc, nope better upgrade first before buying it. i mean, idk man my pc is not even that bad."
GAME JANCOK GAME IKI TERLALU REALISTIS SAMPEK GARAI MOTO PICEK POKOK GAME TAEK IKI ISI E YO TAEK
"Game started going down hill after they started catering to the hardcore community. Wavey noodle arms is not a realistic way to induce suppression. I wish they just did screen effects like the black pin hole or the blurred screen for suppression, instead when you round a corner to an enemy you get to experience the most hilarious gun fighting mechanics in a multiplayer game ever. I wish they would just tone down the noodle arm effect by like 40% and then it would be all better. 

Wish they allowed servers to take out ICO and revert it back a year or two before they started catering to the hardcore mil-sim kids. Some of us just want casual enter a game and not experience dumb mechanics which pretty much split the community into 2."
only reaally pplay with freind
"Clunky, unsmooth movement, weak graphics. I do not recommend."
the game still crash every time i played
"Das Spiel stürzt mindestens jedes 2x Game ab, einfach aus dem Nichts."

"Every time they update this game you roll a dice on whether or not your system will be able to run it or not, unfortunately this most recent update has bricked up my pc."
monkaTOS
Most idiotic way to make a game. Hell let loose much better.
"The servers are mainly hosted by discord groups which is great. But, the servers all suck. Either there is 30 people there. Which makes it kinda hell. Or there is less than 8 people in a lobby basically meaning 1-2 people are playing on your team. 2-3 on the enemy team. While the rest are AFK."
"Not a great game. Gameplay wise this is a game that wants to be ""Hyper realistic"" but fails in doing so. Shooting is overblown and over exaggerated, the optics travel slower than the line of sight causing you to look in one direction and the optic and gun move to that location slowly, like you're using your arms then moving your head instead of you're torso, it then has to much inertia and flies out to the side before coming back in. 
Stamina has improved slightly, you can now run like a modern untrained man carrying 60lbs of gear. However the arms shaking like noodles in an earthquake is not realistic, make it impossible to aim at half or less stamina"
тупо черный екран и бесконечная загрузка
"R9 6900HS ,RX 6700S, 32Gb RAM - Low settings 30-45 fps, on what you guys play..."
"My mic is not working.
It works for everithing else but Sqad  >:("
Weird gunplay
"Fps drops from 70 to 40 when just 1 bullet hits me. 5 3600, rx6600, 3200hz 16gb of ram, 1280x960p, fsr2.0 on balance, minimum settings. So, with these settings I dont see shit and still dont have a stable fps."
the game in so glitcy
"game decided not to work any more. i ask steam and the game dev for help and all i get is 'to bad not our problem get scammed off 55$"""
"Too many crashes. Refunded. The game feels good though, I would probably had a lot of fun if ti wasn't for the crashes."
"lags too much,"
"spent three hours joining a server, walking around for 20mins, and then leaving out of frustration, hell let loose would never lmao"
"gets boring fast with or without friends, refunded. In no universe is this worth 50Eur lmao"
game is good dont get me wrong i mean the environment before war is perfect but the shooting is so bad and stupid LOL like wtf is that ?
我身为中国玩家给我的感受非常不好中国阵营的太垃圾了自家国家的军队明明那末强大这游戏坚决太垃圾了
private server rules are gae
"ICO changes aren't for me. Seems to be love or hate for people, so be cautious about it."
"The game is fun for the most part but the biggest problem is it is expanding too fast. The developers need to stop wasting their time on community guidelines for server admins and start figuring out how to fix their game. 

Here is a list of commonly occurring bugs that have persisted since the opening of the game:
- Reload glitch (your weapon can't reload)
- Helicopter skips (the helo skips across the sky and you can't accurately shoot at it)
- Audio glitches that make it seem like someone is shooting next to you
- Getting stuck under the map after climbing over a rock
inability to use bi-pod
- Visual glitches
- Physics get messed up when vehicles collide
- Vehicles get stuck on the smallest of rocks
- Many more that you can find people complaining about.

The biggest problem for me is that the admins on all servers have to follow some pretty stupid rules that the game developers made. For example, I was in a squad called ""join if gay"" and the admins banned the SL and disbanded the squad. This isn't the first time I've been confronted by dumb arbitrary rules that are implemented by the admins. I found out that these aren't the admins' rules, they are OWIs and they force the servers to follow them in order to make them official. 
It is just unfortunate that the developers are a bunch of communist party simps who implement stupid LGBTQ+ alpha beta gamma delta alphabet stupid shit."
This shit is a polished turd with a fan base that takes the game too seriously. Other factors also do not make the game very fun :(
"Consider before buying:
- Performance is awful (even with a 4090 YOU WILL LAG)
- Game stutters, when seeing tanks, trucks, explosions, bullets, standing up, proning, enemies INF
- If you have a vision impairment DO NOT GET THIS GAME
- Cannot turn off screen shakes/effects you will get motion sickness
- Winning still feels like losing
- Hit-reg issues
- If you jump from a pebble you will take fall damage, anything higher you will need a revive
- Crawling for 30 mins just to get shot by someone who was sitting there 1 hour before you
- Not seeing any enemies for 2 hours (you really can go a full game without seeing a single person)
- Digging simulator
- You can't see past 300m without fog covering your scope
- Can't lower volume of voice lines of a 60$ game. ""At this time that is not possible"" - OWI Support
- Can't customize volume types (either eardrum gets blown out by explosions or you can't hear enemy footsteps)
- Enemies can see you through grass but you can't see them
- ""switching to your pistol is always faster than reloading"" not in this game, it always takes longer.

No sex
"My main issue with this game is that it's extremely badly optimized. It keeps crashing no matter what I do. I close all of my tasks on my PC except steam, spotify and obviously squad, I lower my textures and overall quality of graphics to low/medium and It still keeps crashing.

Crashes usually occur for me when; 
1. a tank shot, grenade or any type of other high explosive explodes in my line of sight.
2. Heavy machine gun/rifle shootout is going on near me

As of right now for me, the game is unplayable, I didn't have a single session of Squad when I wouldn't crash. I didn't even get the chance to experience the full gameplay after 8.7 hours of ""playing"" because of the crashes. Therefore I can't rate the game's gameplay yet.

For reference; I have GeForce RTX 4060, i7 13650 and DDR5 16 GB RAM."
"The game is realistic in every way,but what bother me the most is thet the fps is constantly bad and the shooting is poorly done,as if my character is holding a rifle with one hand, especially if you have optics on the rifls,i shot with real rifles,non of them behave like that,please fix it breaks the whole game thank you very much bye"
"Honestly I just suck, if you like games like Arma then yeah its fine but I cant seem to ever see the enemy and dont have hours to spend walking around.
-skill issue"
"You're not gonna have a good time as a new player, the game pace is really slow, the tutorials don't teach you enough."
Game don't play like it was sponsored. Poor performance and looks like shiiit.
"2 years ago I would've said this was a good game but now the gunplay is so bad and not fun anymore, people who we're good at controlling recoil and aiming are now nerfed due to ICO dont buy this game"
"After coming back to the game after a while, I've noticed that the gameplay has devolved significantly. This game used to be challenging and the gunplay was skill based, where as now it's too easy to get kills and pray and spray is a viable option. My average kills have significantly increased and it's taken the fun out of the game."
"Too hard, not my thing"
"Not worth it. Gameplay is laggy, servers are few, community is mostly foreign languages, intermittent freezing. You'll be much happier with an alternative like ARMA for milsim.  4 hours of gameplay with 3 hours trying to diagnose issues. For reference, I have zero issues with ARMA, COD, RoN, PUBG, Rust, etc..."
too fucking much time required only play if you are a total incel
boring
"Cant load into the main menu once, after 5 hours"
"run, gun, die"
Gun play is just frustrating
Least fucking realistic milsim out there. Literally buy battlebits. And i am not even ragebaiting
Game was ruined by the new gun play honestly cant enjoy a this game anymore
"broken game, menus freeze more than a deer on a highway and wont let you select teams/squads to join"
"I had squad on a different account and played it years ago. Got it on this new account and honestly, I kinda regret it. The changes to the movement, suppression effect, etc has made this game annoying to play. Trying to revive people and heal them up, only to go blind because some guy is shooting at the wall next to me. God forbid you sprint 5 feet and have to wait for what feels like an eternity to have your sights stabilize. Good luck if you get in one of those matches where there isn't any ammo anywhere because no one wants to run logistics, or drop an ammo bag. If you get a group of friends to play with it can be fun to mess around with. If you are playing solo and join randoms, good luck. Tried to play it again recently for an entire week, but it's just too annoying."
Battlefield V And Battlefield 2042 is Better.
"Matchmaking (if you can even call it that) is abysmal. Frame drops, lag and just overall poor performance. Don't recommend."
no
Dog Shit
ICO bad.
This is the worst game i've ever played. This game is mid. I got yelled at for crashing a helicopter.
"This game should be called Asking Permission and Death Simulator, I have asked permission to refund the game."
This game could be the ARMA competitor as it runs more smoothly on my old pc and seems well designed.. but the flight model even setting up the joystick is so terrible that I have returned the gifted game :-(
"This game has a HUGE new player onboarding problem.  With the new sales and subsequent spikes in player count, match quality is at an all time LOW.  Very little teamwork and communication.  People don't understand basic mechanics because they're not explained anywhere, which forces all the boring activities on to a small amount of players.  Yes, there are boring things in this game that HAVE to be done in order to be successful.  

Gunplay is horrid and janky.  There's hardly any control over your characters basic movements.  Rounds passing in your general vicinity literally blind you, which makes no sense. Weapon sway is absurd.  Honestly, its BORING.

With the ICO, they made an already slow game even slower, and more stagnant.  Games used to rarely reach the end of their timers, now its a regular occurence.  They changed their entire gameplay model to suit people who were getting frustrated because they were getting killed by people they couldnt see.  So in order to create a ""more authentic combat experience"" they made it so now people just spray wildly at each other.  its just dumb, and ungratifying gameplay.

On top of this, OWI refuses to sincerely listen to their community, and has purged most of their past Q&A sessions and related blogs from their website so you can't look back on their empty promises.  I wish I could get the time and money I invested into this game back"
Just play battlebit instead 💀
"one of the worst games ive played in years, didnt see a single enemy for my hour+ of gameplay, id rather put my dick in a blender than play this boring ass shit again. Refunded"
Crashes to much
"of the 6h ""playtime"", i had 2 games about 1h playtime. 0 communication, ppl not going for capture points. This is the worst game i've ever played and have payed for."
Not for me what so ever
"Runs like doo doo, even though I have a fricking RTX 4090"
pathetic playerbase
This game is surch a masterpiece so sad that the devs wont take a look at the steam deck performance this game just keeps crashing mid game or when they switch a map...
Good game but very bad optimization ! I have high end pc and game run like a screenshots
"i want a refund
with who do i play?
no servers no campaigin ...."
comedic weapon handling
"It's like they took the Battlefield formula, and then removed every single fun part, and I don't even like Battlefield!"
.
mods are cool base game isnt
Man fuck this game. Shit that worked in the menu nearly 7 years ago was removed and no longer works. But thank fuck that they added paid skins and emotes right :D
from the moment i bought the game i cant even play it every time i enter a match the game after 3 minutes of play crashes every sing time. i dont have this problem anywhere else with any other game
"I loved this game before ICO.
ICO killed it. Then the updates after ICO made it bearable. Just bearable, not fun.

Your scopes are rolling all over the place, like your character is on a rocky boat. It's perpetually uncomfortable and making me slightly sick.
Furthermore the changes to movement killed any semblance of quick offensives or counter-offensives on foot. Even small things like placing HABs and emplacements, takes way longer now.

It doesn't even feel ""tactical"" or ""realistic"" just feels like the devs decided to nerf some mechanics for the sake of it.

**I will update this review, when the state of the game improves. I would love to say more positive things. But unfortunately all my good memories are overshadowed by a broken game."
Offworld needs to hire a decent graphic designer. Because jesus christ. The UI is the battlefield 2042 level of quality.
They sold out
"love the game, but crashs all the time, wait to buy until they fix it, its not in a good state"
"It's good mil-sim game
but it's too much.

Things I don't like
- being controlled by admin
- you need to be in squad, no freedom
- no call of duty, no battlefield
- So realistic (more than ARMA, one shot-one kill)
- Walking simulator

I will go back to something more casual and more freedom."
Way too difficult for no reason. Have no shame in saying that. It is complicated in many areas for no reason. It's got cool sounds and moments but that is it. If you want a modern shooter mil sim I guess this is it unfortunately. Hopefully team 17 the developer team that made hell let loose makes a modern mil sim cause this is not it. The developers of squad swung and missed.
very       bad
Terribly optimized and movement/gun handling is trash. I've never seen a game that bobs and sways as much as this one.
boring
"This is purely a helicopter review, any other aspect of the game might be awesome. But the main lure for me was gone once I tried the helis.

The helicopters are bad. Really bad. The flight model feels as if they were dangled form a string and pulled on icy rails where ever they are going. There are no sensible physics affecting anything that happens in the air and you'll need to unlearn everything you know about helicopters to get a hang of these weird scifi levitation machines. Switching my heli stick to m&kb made things easier, but that only goes to show the depth of the problem. 

No hate to anyone who enjoys these helis. I'm sure the simple flight model makes it more approachable and predictable, and more enjoyable for many people. But for combined arms action seeking helicopter enjoyers I can not recommend this."
"Movement/gunplay

- Movement feels like you're playing on ice, everything is delayed.
- Gun play feels slow and wonky (character will drag the gun across the screen)

Cool stuff
You're able to drag downed players to cover

something that has annoyed me when you're sitting in a vehicle the player character is aiming the barrel towards the head of your character"
whenever i reinstall this game it takes like a whole day cause theres 20 other seperate downloads that are each like 30gbs big
"Tough for new players, aiming system sucks; bad optimization... 
Not this time."
"It was a good game for years, than the wanna be realistic gunplay comes out. Now it feels more like a waste of time and a camping and a walking simulation. It s nearly impossible for new player to feel joy and even for me it is not enjoyable anymore."
Retarded grenade launcher spammer simulator
"One of the worst FPS games out there. Not user-friendly at ALL. It has the worst UI/UX, with all servers being public. This means that to access a server in your language, you often have to wait in a queue. If you have some nerves, you'll get to the spawn stage, but there's a 50% chance there will be zero vehicles, forcing you to run to the frontline(approx. 5 minutes of running). Most of the time, you'll run and die from who knows where, unable to even face the enemy. It's simply trash, garbage, rubbish."
noodle arms...
"Unfortunately, it has very bad graphics.. and runs bad like hell. Otherwise it would be amazing, with that realistic gunplay, sounds, first-person animations etc., for me it would be even better than PUBG. But right now I can't recommend it because of that."
"A Milsim somehow less  fun than Arma. It feels like most of my time was spent waiting for timers to tick down, recovering from spawn camping and the decisions of incompetent team mates. The graphics are fine though lackluster and seem strangely cartoonish for a Milsim. Equipment choices are minimal and uninteresting. Perhaps it's rose tinted glasses, but unfortunately for me, it seems I will never enjoy a Milsim FPS more than I did Red Orchestra."
I love ico
Its an amazing game but it just crashes a lot that's my only complaint buy at your own risk
i don't remember when i got this game but i sure hope i didn't pay full price after experiencing playing as a soldier who holds guns at their hip like an 80s action movie goon with jelly arms.
"god forbid that i be able to hold my rifle and shoot, this game claims to be a realistic shooter but the thought of a trained infantryman be able to shoot more than 3 feet in front of you, i used to love this game but its just bad now they try promote teamwork by making everyone unable to shoot a weapon without standing still for 4 seconds this game acts like your a little girl shooting a rifle for the first time"
"Dissapointed with the direction of the game, things im looking forward to
1) Back up sights 
2) Gunner camera 
3) Optimisation"
Would not recommend if you're in South Africa. No South African servers and because of that it feels very laggy. So if in ZA don't buy
"Not really fun. 

Let me give you a example of a normal match: Spawn in. Take a vehicle or get a ride somewhere to defend or attack. Shoot at bushes and trees. Die from someone in an unknown location (probably in a bush or behind a tree). Spawn again, run for 5 mins to get back to where you were. Die again from an unseen enemy in a bush. Spawn again. Run for 5 mins.  Rinse. Repeat. aaaand that's it. 

 I'm not saying its a ""bad"" game... just not fun. Like... at all."
"Squad changed, and the community is divided because of the changes that offworld have made to core game mechanics. 

Casual players who play the game are often silent and are unwilling to cooperate, which is a major influence and mechanic  required to having good experience in game play."
every snowflake boomer plays this game
"It's a perfect game while scroling tiktok or youtube. Sometimes fun. If you want a HC shooter-try Insurgency Sandstorm. In this game, the word tactical means: ignore the objective and do something else till the end of the round (i've noticed a true pathern here)."
"This is the first i have ever written a review for a game because if something bothers me i would just simply jump onto a new game. But it is disheartening to see what they have done to the game. ICO just destroyed the game completely, now every bullet cause blurring of the screen not to mention the rest of infantry ""updated system"" now everything is plain headache at this point. I hope that they will either revise what they have done or this game to die out pretty soon."
Servers do not show up
Walking for 15min just so I can get teamkilled while im screaming friendly fire..
"What a colossal letdown Squad turned out to be. With all the hype surrounding it, I was expecting a glorious fusion of Arma 3's intricate tactical gameplay and Battlefield's epic scale. Instead, I got a hot mess that couldn't decide if it wanted to be a serious military simulator or a run-of-the-mill shooter.

Let's start with the asinine blurriness mechanic. Seriously, who thought it was a good idea to turn the screen into a blurry mess every time you get shot? It's not immersive; it's just plain dumb. Congratulations, Squad, you've managed to simulate what it feels like to have cataracts in the middle of a firefight. Bravo.

And don't even get me started on the gameplay. Gone are the complexities of Arma 3, replaced with a dumbed-down version that wouldn't challenge a toddler. And as for the epic battles of Battlefield? Yeah, good luck finding anything remotely resembling that here. Instead, you get small-scale skirmishes that feel more like a game of paintball than a realistic military engagement.

In conclusion, Squad is a sorry excuse for a game that fails miserably to live up to its lofty promises. Save yourself the frustration and steer clear of this dumpster fire of a title."

Really shitty behaviour IMO, sad as it's such a great game"
"I like this game, but it's unplayable in its current state due to huge FPS drops (despite having a pretty good PC)."
"Bug Severely damaged playing experience. 

First I cannot even rebind the keys, once I did it my character would repeat crouching and stuck at its position. Another very point I cannot stand is I could not change my weapon loadout.When my mouse trying to change it the map would pop out which caused I could only use some very shitty guns. Offworld, Is it so hard to fix these so annoying bug?"
"Shame. This game really had something special here but due to massive performace drawbacks and no intention to fix them or upgrade to the newer UE. While also removing our beloved GE... it isnt worth it anymore. Come for GC, stay for the pepoe.

Seriously though, why you baffled? when the game is built by good devs and then handed to nobodies, expect the worse."
Poo now
"crashes, ass"
"Had Maybe 10 servers under 100 ping for me. (East coast with 1GB, DL speeds) 5 were full, 5 were empty. Could not get into a full server even after queing, and waiting for over 20 minutes. NO THANKS"
"imagine leaking screenshots of upcoming content for positive steam reviews

btw this game is still unoptimized trash"
"Unoptimized to hell, hope if you have a RTX 2060 that you can get a stable 30fps 

Also consistently breaks my only reason to play Squad, Galactic Contention. With the smallest what would be insignificant updates. They just hate modders."
ever sense Offworld added weapon skins the game has been on the decline. When you aim your gun if you aren't standing still its going to start waving around like the trained soldier your playing as has never shot a gun before. This makes sense for some factions like the Irregular Militia Forces but not for the US Marines. That gun shouldn't move a bit this makes the game very annoying in my opinion.
"Failed school, lost my job, wife and dog. By god I'd do it again.

Edit: They came back! Gone again"
"infantry rework lol 
lmfao"
This game is taped together steamy ass pile and honestly the worst game i have ever played. they only made the game to keep military vets from shooting/hanging themselves
"the game is okay i guess if you get lucky, it runs like ass while also looking like ass with everything being grainy as hell past 100 meters. if you dont do exactly what the commander says or you use a vehicle that they dont want you to you just get kicked because you didnt follow their extreme larp fantasy properly."
Sometimes teamnames doesnt show up and it is hard to identify the uniforms it is so frustrating and i hate that
"[O] Ceeg — Today at 17:23
@here Sorry about the ping folks, but we are LEAKING screenshots of upcoming content in return for positive Steam Review links.... 

Nope !"
"I'd recommend staying away from this title unless you like being in the boots of a hardened veteran with severe delirium tremens, asthma, palsy, and potentially numerous other health complications that prevent him from running 10 meters and holding a gun level. 

  There's also some pretty glaring balance issues surrounding vehicles and antitank availability. 
  
  A community that ranges from extremely helpful and cooperative, to downright COD tier basement dwellers that think watching Jar Head and Platoon counts as a tour of duty.

  Some of the mods are neat, but it seems like updates to the core game can sometimes completely break them for months until someone figures out  how and what got fumbled by OWI.

  Overall avoid this game, much like OWI avoids implementing a proper flight model for helicopters. 


BTW Mattocracy [UE4] on YouTube got Helicopters working rather well years before OWI realsed their janky messed up interpretation of whirly birds.  It's worth checking out his video on the Defunct Helicopter mod, which is still overall more detailed and accurate to the operation of the real aircraft than anything OWI has the talent to produce."
"Игра не запускается, после титров в самом начале запуска имею черный экран, в диспетчере задач игра не отвечает, но нагружает процессор на 30%. Обновлял драйвера, dx, vc++, net 3.5/4.0, ничего не помогло. Запускал с eac и без него, запускал в режиме совместимости. Ничего не поменялось в общем, даже главное меню не могу посмотреть, лол. Игру не буду возвращать только с надеждой на то, что эту оплошность пофиксят."
"plain and simple, its a bad game fuc you"
арма лучше
"Devs are scum.  Rating is padded with positive reviews solicited in exchange for ""leaked screenshots"" of upcoming content.

Optimization is almost as bad as ARMA (you will not get more than 60 fps consistently even on a top-of-the-line rig), and the devs could care less.  Their focus is now exclusively to continue pumping out additional micro-transactions.

Shame.  What was and would could have been."
insanely boring
bad graphics looks like muck bad optimization  gpu and cpu 50% only utilization with i5-12thgen and rtx 3070 barely getting 80 fps  want to buy it wait for sale and don't get it for more than 5$
"This game is more toxic than cod lobbies. Joined a new player friendly server and didnt have a squad to join so I made one. People join, I give someone else squad lead because I have no clue what i'm doing and im kicked for ""Squad baiting"". Not to mention youre constantly told to change a class or sit on an objective MILES away from any fighting. As someone who has a couple hours max to play any game a day I just wanted to flank objectives and maybe snipe. Not join a fucking cult. Jesus christ"

cant run the game thru steam
Community manager broke Steam TOS for positive steam reviews
no ammo. looking at dead enemies gun.. cannot pick it up. wait to die. 6/10
What once was great is turned to garbage with their new combat system from an infantry perspective. You fight the sway of your gun more than you do players.  Not worth 50$ with the current broken shooting system let alone 20$.
Yes
damn unreal crashing
"This game is fucking shit, Heres an example. I joined 3 servers over the last 2 hours and had 0 seconds of combat due to the poor state of the team being totally fucking rolled or totally out picked in the faction select and unable to play the game because no one is pushing except for vehicles that cant be killed because before you hit them with 4 AT devices they run away and then come back and make the game unplayable again while the enemy team dosent push at all they just cock ride the armor. And then theres maps like fucking Talil where infantry had 30 kills in a RAAS and the game was dictated by a few vehicles while everyone else hid because no one fights past 300 meters and no one can push or maneuver. And then on top of that people dont even realize when someone is cheating in the game, Usually in the stronger Fighting vehicles of their faction through ghosting, or literal ESP, in the last 3 days LAV-25s specifically have more information than they could possibly have obtained through legitimate means about HAB locations and infantry movements on the map. aswell as coincidentally just shooting the AT behind cover but only untill hes dead and never when hes not there. This is like absurd and because if its not a guy teleporting and shooting people through the map with magic bullets then its not cheating, thats what the squad players mean when they've only seen X cheaters. REGION LOCK and kick children from the servers you play on, and there will be 0 cheaters."
Cant see where anyone is shooting from.
"game ruined after the Infantry Overhaul Update wich implemented Parkinson Disease, of wich your character cant run 5m and ads keeping the arm steady as if it suddenly gets parkinson disease or drunk af, definetly a milsim where your character is a very trained soldier ofc, thats why most ppl play modded/private servers untouched by the infantry overhaul update, if you plan to invite your friends they would get immediately bored and pissed off and install ARMA 3/Reforger instead saying f***k you hahaha

GG FF 15."
ICO ruined it.
doesn't start
"People are begging for more optimization, but for all the boasts from the devs about listening to their community it seems that falls on deaf ears. ICO update went too far- while ADS weapons wander WAYYYY too much even if you have full stamina, it almost makes me laugh how bad it is. Bipods on weapons are so barrely usable,  they might aswell not exist. Paid emotes are stupid and have no place in this game. Maybe there needs to be a strong competitor to squad before these devs get their **** together."
"God has forsaken me and so has my team

Not *my squad though*, they're great

This game is good for a time sink, but it's on the same level as League of Legends where you don't get actual enjoyment because it's too stressful like having to deal with teammates who do things that will lose you the match that takes on average an hour or the frustrating gunplay that's ""hyperrealistic"" with the recoil and suppression. I mean FFS my trained soldier can't handle recoil?"
"You have fixed aiming now and good job on that, credit where credit is due. Suppression system is still needs a few tweaks though but it's heading in the right direction.

But I still can't recommend, as this game needs serious optimization. And multiple simple mechanics could/ need to be added like using BUS on optics, the ability to walk slower when aiming, or contextual leaning/weapon support on/against walls and barriers."
"Every update I have to go through and fix my audio again and again. Every single other game I play I launch the game and I hear the audio its not rocket science. These devs cant seem to figure it out. I launch the game, hear the game dev logo whoosh by, then nothing. Usually I can run audio through my speakers instead of my headphones to play, but after the last update I cant even do that. If I could hear it would be great game-play, but since I cant the game is obviously unplayable."
gay
game plays like roblox
"It COULD be a popular game, but they make players host ALL servers which only serves to save the developers money and make the player experience infinitely worse than it should be. Literally everyone gets worse performance because they're connected to some dudes PC in his German basement when I live in NY..."
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no on no this game is so fucking hard
"Was gone for military training, and came back to find they had completely destroyed the handling of weapons. People claim it's ""realistic,"" but again as someone who just got done with handling these exact weapons in training, it's really not. In-game if you try and do something that WOULD be realistic, like pieing a corner, you're punished by being forced to aim at the ceiling by IMMENSE weapon sway. 

Stay away unless you like only being able to shoot straight after not moving or touching your mouse for 4 seconds."
"IMAGINE CRAWLING WITH A MACHINE GUN IN A FULL KIT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SOUND, SUCH A GOOD SOUND DESIGN.

Also imagine having a beef with an admin of a single server that puts you into ban list for half of servers of this game, also called community ban list so you can get kicked from a completely different server mid game, lovely concept."
ruined the game with the aiming
Stuck in loading screen constantly and the game is boring
nothing but crashes every time i join a game
game crashes constantly and im running a 4060 doesnt make any sense
"Extremely slow pace and no progression system. There is no point to winning or losing so I hope you just enjoy running across fields and getting server banned for saying ""no no"" words on audio chat. This game has more players banned for speech than they have active players.."
"if you want a positive review, don't bribe me with leaks. just make your game fun."
Great game until they added the ICO update.
Posting a review for leaked images as promised by the Devs

""@here Sorry about the ping folks, but we are LEAKING screenshots of upcoming content in return for positive Steam Review links 🙂 38 minutes remaining to get as many in here as possible. Double sized snippets if you turn a negative into a positive!"" - Official OWI Discord, from a Staff Member

For those who are unaware, the above request breaks Steams TOS, and is an unfair attempt at review gouging. 

Squad is a good game, but if OWI is allowing - or even encouraging - their staff to attempt to review gouge in exchange for benefits - in-game or otherwise - then this is a serious sign that Squad and its developers are shifting less from trying to be a community focused game and moving towards trying to turn this into a profit cow like most AAA Studios, and do so at the expense of the player and their experience."
"ICO ruined the game. Great idea on paper, who doesn't like the fluidity of Red Orchestra/Rising Storm or the functionality of ARMA. Execution was terrible, OWI tried to make gunplay ""realistic"" while leaving the damage model arcade-like (health/revive system similar to battlefield). Weapon sway, ADS times. and recoil are insanely exaggerated. There is no weapon resting mechanic. The FOB (respawn point) system means that the drawn-out firefight type of gameplay the ico tries to encourage is meaningless as unless you meatwave a FOB quickly, the people you manage to kill will respawn immediately.

On top of all this, the game gets more bugs every update. The amount of unfixed bugs is insane."
crashes
pvp is dead
walking simulator with un-moderated racism/xenophobic players on most servers

"Hey everyone! I wanted to clarify the post about leaking images of the M320 yesterday. We were trying to build some excitement for an upcoming Devblog but should have approached it differently. The Intent was to increase engagement through people linking me to their existing Steam reviews rather than by creating new ones.

I want to apologize to the Squad community. We tried this hastily and without forethought. We value honest, open transparency in our communications with the community here, and you should expect the same from us. We want to hear how you feel about Squad—positive or negative—as it helps us be informed in our decision-making and the work we put in to continue to update the game.

We will take extra measures moving forward to ensure we are thoughtfully engaging the community in new and fun ways.

We want to keep making the game the best tactical FPS on the market, and we can only do it with the care and passion of the community behind it. Thanks for helping us be accountable, and please continue to do so. We look forward to growing Squad together."
This game is so poorly optimized. Every single update they make it even worse. The fps goes down each time. They have massive amounts of bugs and fix one but make two more. They also bribe people to leave good reviews ;)
Squad Update V6.0 ruined the game. Gun sway makes me feel like I'm playing a drunkard. My child can steady a gun better than this.

"Game is good if:
You can tolerate noodle arms.
You can wait 1min before shooting a bullet after ADSing.
You have the patience to walk for 20min and die.
You don't compare to any other game.
Hate how smooth driving is in other games.

The communities are great. The people are great. The game? meh.. 

Game went from being in my top 2 games right up there with Tarky, to being nothing more than an afterthought in a very short amount of time. Sadly and most unfortunately, do not recommend in current state."

Nah
after 1700 hrs i can confirm this game will die the ICO is horrendous i get adding suppression mechanics they are good but the gun play is miserable it is a chore just to get bullets downrange i miss the old squad
"good game ig has alot of potential that is losing out
first of all recoil and gun handling is like you have never trained with firearms (remember you are military you are supposed to already be trained on them), optimization missing,  nice sounds but not a good variety of them"
Dev's trying to bribe for positive reviews is cringe.
ICO is bad.
"Bad aiming system, boring, bad vehicle comment, bribing for positive reviews"
"2025 Update 

Tried to come back and play some more but the server browser is currently broken so I am unable to join any of the servers my clan is in at the moment.

Its honestly impressive OWI continues to break the game nearly a decade down the road.


Back in 2015 when I first donated to the kickstarter I never thought it would be nearly a decade later and I would be writing a negative review telling people to pass on this game.

Huge respect to clans such as Squadops , OG Tactical Trig members and others who have kept the community alive on life support from 2016-2021.

Its been very sad to watch OWI drive the community it spent nearly a decade making straight into the ground. When your community managers start asking for steam reviews in return for leaked pictures of a grenade launcher that is just a new level of sadness to see. 

I will only really reinstall this game when I have the urge to play Star Wars Galactic Contention now.

The core game is quite good but the community management has just been awful. Standing up your own server is a painful experience with only surface level documentation on how to tune the performance of a server to keep it over that 40-50 tick threshold before it starts to see performance impact. While changes to infantry gameplay were needed the Infantry Combat Overhaul alienated a lot of veteran players and clans. Vehicles need a similar overhaul as they are currently painful to play and get stuck on all sorts of little objects. We are also still waiting for mechanics like fast ropes that have been discussed for years now.

Pros 

Amazing community with some fantastic clans that I have played with over the years 
Awesome mods such as Middle East Escalation and Star Wars Galactic Contention 
Diverse weapon selection and vehicles to choose from
Invasion mode is extremely fun when played on the right servers
Good visuals and graphics overall
You will make friends to game with for the rest of your life

Cons 

Very poor optimization and performance
Increase in cheaters since 2022
Poor community management 
Server browser has been in various states of broken for months
Unable to take constructive criticism in their own discord and often mute/ban people quickly
Developer seems focused on other projects even with a recent increase in content.
Tencent investments into OWI
Infantry Combat Overhaul felt extremely rushed and brought back even more bugs than before
Squad leading is a brutal and painful experience at times

Having played over 1000 hours mostly from 2020-2023 its just unfortunate to see Squad in its current state."
Apparently the new community manager broke Steam TOS to coerce reviews by promising screenshots of future content for positive reviews on steam. See other reviews for more details.
played a lot in the past and just started playing again... guess that is done with this bribery b.s. not worth rewarding a shady company
"7 months ago they released an update that made infantry combat (you know, the thing you'll be doing 90% of the time) a complete and utter pain. Squad's gun-play post ICO update is genuinely and without exaggeration THE worst I have EVER seen in a shooter.

In brief, you have virtually 0 control over your aiming the instant a single bullet is fired within 20 meters of you. It sounds like an exaggeration, but the majority of CQB engagements now end as a knife fight because neither player is able to actually hit the other due to the insane weapons sway.

On top of the largest aspect of the game (gunplay) being more frustrating then fun, here is a list of issues that makes me NOT recommend you spend your time or money on this game:

• Squad is absolutely PLAGUED by performance issues (good luck getting the game to run consistently),

• Game ruining bugs that have been present for YEARS (RPG reload bug says hello),

• Incompetent dev team that ignores the player-base.

• Break-down of the game's CRUCIAL teamwork aspect; The fun you have playing Squad WILL be determined by the skill of your Squad Leader. Since the ICO update 7 months ago, most experienced players have quit the game, and have been replaced by new players who don't have the experience to lead the teams and make the game FUN!

If you buy Squad today, just know and accept that the game does get worst with every update."
This game is now ass and the devs should feel bad
Official discord is breaking steam tos to try and get positive reviews. OWI is getting more and more scummy recently.
The Infantry Combat Overhaul a while ago made the Weapon Sway horrible. It's like everyone has Parkinsons. Also the new Community Manager tried to bribe People for positive Reviews. Very scummy.
"The game is decent, the community is decent, OWI is scum. I remembered to leave this review after they broke Steam ToS and bribed their Discord with early access if they posted positive reviews and changed negative reviews to positive. Not a good look for a studio already steeped in controversy."
Openly bribing positive reviews.

"they have to optimize the game, poorly optimized"
Game is pretty bad. Begs people in discord for positive steam reviews to leak future content
"Canadian welfare developer turned Chinese data harvester Offworld Industries has hit another new low. Not only did they kill their game with an abysmal Infantry Combat Overhaul, they're now caught with their pants down essentially bribing for positive reviews."
They’re really trying to bribe people for positive reviews because they fucked up the game and dumped experience players. Then they came to Post Scriptum and did the same thing. Fuck these guys. Ruined two of my favorite games.
"DO NOT BUY

OWI employees are incentivicing positive reviews in trade for ""content leaks"" on their Discord server. Add to this the recent addition of micro transactions and the buggy mess of a game.

This is a definitely a game to avoid!"
"Since the Infantries overhaul guns behave unrealistic and its alot harder to fire or return fire because your barrel has gone to space by the time you even know where they are firing from. not to mention random crashes and performance issues.
ull play for like 2 hrs and then something will happen the game does not like and boom CTD fun at times but the devs need to focus more on the community's wants."
"I've stopped playing Vanilla. Sometimes modded if friends are playing it.

I joined a gaming community to play this game as a team and had a ton of fun nights on Discord with them.

One of the game's standout features was its exceptional in-game communication. The standard use of a mic allowed for good banter with players on the battlefield. This was as much a draw as the gameplay itself.

The ICO update meant many experienced players (including myself) stopped playing. There's a noticeable lack of experienced players in game. The infantry shooting mechanics (in an FPS Game) are terrible, and the time taken to raise your weapon to aim down sights is laughable.

ICO has also destroyed the pace of gameplay, encouraging players to camp in bushes rather than risk movement and flanking.

OWI has doubled down on the ICO update, being tone-deaf to long-standing players. Now, they're soliciting positive reviews for 'leaked' updates.

It's scummy, and it's a shame to see how much the developers managed to run the game into the ground and alienate a large portion of their community in less than a year."
They are coercing people for positive reviews on discord.
"After being bought out, the game is turning for the worst. The cherry on top is asking for positive reviews in exchange for screenshots."
"I cannot in good conscious recommend this game as it is right now.

Squad has been suffering from performance problems for several years now. Even with a RTX 4070 and i9-13900k I cannot get a stable framerate at 60 if I push graphic settings above Medium. Maps are extremely unoptimised where looking at a forest will drop your frames by 20.

This has never been addressed or improved on. I used to play this game at 60+ FPS with a GTX 1060 when the game first came out. I updated to a 4070 when the 1060 couldn't handle even 24fps at any point without dropping the resolution down.

Secondly as others are starting to realise. OWI devs on the discord are literally bribing users to post positive reviews and prove it to get sneak peaks to future content. This is borderline breaking Steam TOS and shows lack of confidence in their own product to stand on its own.

Squad is a shadow of it's former self in how it was developed and conducted.

Even to this day, the Marksman class from it's inception is a plagued class where you will get kicked for choosing it. OWI have done nothing to help address this leading it to be a dead class for the majority of matches.

Squad was fun. Empahsis on was."
"Actually I was quite neutral towards Squad but since the latest incident - when a Dev (Ceeg) ""bribed"" people into writing positive reviews - I feel the urge to note some thing.

Unfortunately the game is going down hill for the past two years.
It really seems the devs have lost their focus on what is important.
There haven't been much content or bug fixes/balancing in the past.
Right now it feels like playing abandoned cash cow.

The games optimization is one of my biggest concerns. It's running on a single core with two threads and bottlenecks heavily causing terrible performance even on good machines (running 5800X/4070TI).

A lot of people complain about ICO while I say it was necessary. Unfortunately OWI overtuned the mechanics way too far causing unrealistic/annoying movements (weapon sway, etc.).

Don't get me wrong. It's still unique and very refreshing when you are new and play in a coordinated squad but for veteran players it's really hard to comprehend why they refuse to improve this game.

I really hope that at some point OWI realizes what's going on and return to the original mind set that originally sparked the idea for it."
"700 hours here - game used to be amazing fun. shit now. completely ruined. 90% of everyone I knew also quit after ICO. it hasn't gotten better at all. don't waste your time

also they are desperately asking for positive reviews in their discord, offering leaked content/screenshot in return, pathetic"
"I bought Squad back in 2017 and have been a huge fan of the game ever since, playing both the vanilla and modded versions of the game I have had such fun and have hilarious clips. It pains me a lot to have to leave a negative review but unfortunately even though the community is still great I disagree with the direction that the game is heading, mainly with the infantry combat overhaul (ICO) and now the community manager bribing their official discord community with leaks to gain positive reviews on steam, I have to advise against getting this game at the moment. I think a large portion of the silent playerbase is against the ICO changes and believe that it sacrifices the gameplay for ""realism"". A few of my buddies and I came back to the game after a year or two and the moment they tried to ADS it was an instant turn off for them.

I still love Squad and hope OWI turns things around and finds better ways to improve the game."
devs have sunk to a new low. After ruining the game for their core audience and skewing to a different community for content. Negative reviews bombed their game from the majority of the monthly active users at the time. OWI is now coercing members of their discord with skin keys and teasers of future content all for the low price of violating steams TOS. All you have to do to get a teaser for future content or to win a skin key is to send a positive review on the steam store page! something extremely in violation of steams terms of service! Dont forget to dm them with proof that you indeed shilled out your precious voice for stolen content! disgusting
"They did it again:
- OWI has added ingame ad that shows up when launching game - meaning that they advertise the game in the game itself - I already bought the game I don't need to be sold on buying it. That video is almost 3 minutes long btw
- OWI has (once again) made changes to the game without announcing them in release notes - multiple vehicle sounds were changed, audio falloff range was increased,
- OWI has added mobile spawn vehicles to a single faction in the game which completely messes with the overall meta of the game,
- new scoreboards are a mess, unless server owners adjust the defaults you have no time to even vote for the next faction or map because you're still checking the scoreboard,
- game performance is constantly neglected by the devs, they released a faction with minigun vehicles that cause server wide FPS drops when fired,
- meanwhile bugs that have been present in the game for years are still unresolved, i.e. command actions being called in on a completely different location, Nvidia Reflex being broken since multiple patches, etc."
"The ""community manager"" ceeg pinged everyone on discord to leave a positive review and he will ""leak"" screenshots of a future update, so here it is."
"Meh, After a couple of years still feels like a Uniengine assetflip. Squadleading is hell and there still a shit ton of bugs. All this for 45€..... 

Not saying it's that bad... It's just average. The ico is a very little step towards a good direction but still very little cooperation.

Also, community manager asking for positive reviews in exchange of sneak peaks? Fuck off man."
ICO update ruined the game
"Tried it...seems to be getting worse and worse. 
i played before offworld took over. things seemed better then. recoil was better.

now its like your soldier has noodle arms. and is an asthmatic kid...
with gun wobble equal to that of a level 5 earthquake...what happend???

Lack of communication with the Mod Dev teams that breathe fresh air into Squad, little to no communication with Server Owners, ""answering"" questions that no one asked, and not answering the ones that we have asked. Not a surprise to see the Squad community dying. I've enjoyed my time over the years, and have met some pretty cool people, but this is where I hang my boots. GG guys"

Game is real fun but optimization is dog shit. Its been their main issues for many years now but no lets add some cool emotes.
nah bad now
"99% of the playerbase just camps, not sure if they are just mentally slow and/or new to FPS games"
"This game has an amazing and dedicated player base, to which OWI and its creators have been slowly eroding away the skilled and knowledgeable players. After owning this game for 8 years and countless hours I still continue to play only if even just for the people and not its awful horrible gun play introduced in the ICO.I get trying to introduce more ""realism"" when in reality its a game that has so many bugs that it breaks completely out of reality. The game for me was fun because it was a game that had the perfect blend of battlefield and ARMA but the devs seem to think that his game is a mil-sim when its laughably short of anything close. I would tell people to play something else but unfortunately there really isn't much like it. I keep playing because I am dumb and hopeful even though I am doubtful they will ever revert the changes they made to the infantry combat... 

I would rate the idea the base game as a 10/10 but the execution is horrendous and I hope the devs mothers are disappointed in them for destroying a great game."
no
"WAS FUN, THEN THE UPDATE HAPPENED."
"this game was great until it started running in 4k and when i change to a lower res it hides the button to accept. please refund me. never playing again.

edit: i tried the game again, wtf is this ads???? please refund."
"Overpriced Trash that is horribly optimized if you run anything less then a 40 series like me it'll have huge lag spikes for no reason , ICO Ruins The Skill input of the game and the only people who say otherwise are BOOMERS who can't aim at a reasonable speed."
Its insane this game has so many positive reviews. This has to be the worst gun play in any shooter I have ever played. Military realism/sim is a joke. ADSing feels like I'm trying to hold up a telephone pole and the person Im controlling has never held or seen a firearm until the second the match starts.
ruined the game with that update. uninstalled.
Too many cry baby losers who complain and ban over trash talk in a military sim or if you say something the admin doesn't like you get banned. All i see in this game is a cesspool of degenerate losers who got bullied so much IRL so they make a server to be a total cuck tyrant.
"Reviewing after ~900 hours and AFTER overhaul of infantry mechanics.  Updated infantry mechanics turn infantry play into a running and camping simulator. Recoil and gun mechanics make followup shots ineffective. Suppression mechanics (overly) reward players to spray in a general direction. The update to infantry mechanics has introduced a much lower skill cap to the game. Someone with 1000 hours and someone with 100 hours are now far more likely to have the same net impact on a game when playing infantry. This may have been the intent of the devs to make the game more accessible. But instead of boosting the effectiveness of inexperienced players and/or tapering the learning curve, they have neutered the effectiveness of experienced players. 

Squad still has incredible vehicle play. Armor vehicle mechanics are still incredibly fun. But good luck waiting for 30 min vehicle respawns."
"since recent updates it has been non stop crashing, cant even play for an hour(after wasting time sitting in a queue) without it crashing randomly in match, ridiculous, will update when this gets fixed"
The worst parts of ARMA and Battlefield rolled into a stale package.
One of the worst communities of players I have ever been unfortunate enough to play with. Don't buy it.
"After 1200 hours and years of enjoyment, squad is now pretty dead to me.

The developer's attempt to create a truly 'realistic' mil-sim has sucked all of the fun out of the game. The bullet suppression, the recoil, and the time it takes to pull up and steady your gun now just rewards players to spraying bullets around their opponents to keep accurate shots from coming back (instead of actually aiming their rifles).

The result is a maelstrom of bullets, blurred vision, and a black scope face (from not being centered due to suppression), and a distinct lack of fun.

The prior versions of the game had an appropriate amount of suppression/recoil/etc to keep the game feeling realistic, but not unplayable and certainly very fun.

I will check back in a year to see if this gets any better."
"Been playing this game since before launch and let me tell you this game used to be SOOO good, but ICO ruined all their progress, added a whole bunch of stuff expecting to make the game better only to make it just feel clunky and just generally worse not to mention it used to have flawless graphics now its a blurry mess, hip fire is practically pointless now cause your character moves the gun left and right at the slightest shift of your mouse, Please just revert back to alpha settings or let us choose which update we can play on and this game would be heaps better. UPDATE: Just play the modded servers if you want the good ole' squad experience."
trash game need a nasa computer to run it for some unlucky fellas
No clue what the hell was going on for any of it. Was yelled at by people for not knowing what to do. Game-play felt slow and clunky. Not fun at all for a new player.
"Its sad to see this game die out, used to be many servers, now theres only 5 left"
"The game requests too much teamplay , if you are playing with low IQ players you wont be spawning in the map. Most of the players locks out the mechanized vehicles and do not co-operate with the team. If you want to suffer and experience worst gunplay you should try this. But i will give this game with the new update 2 out of 10 it was 7 out of 10 before the update.

After discovering Global Escalation Mod on workshop :

- If you are going to play this game definetly consider downloading the mod and play on the modded servers."
"OWI ruined this once-great game with their radical ICO update, fundamentally transforming a near-decade-old title into an awkward abomination. Gunplay is now absolutely horrendous. It's a Parkinson's disease simulator with optimization issues."
Infantry overhaul ruined the game
I lost my friend to this. He officially joined the taliban.
"Game was great before the ""infantry overhaul"". The developers decided your soldier was no longer a trained individual and held his gun like a monkey in a wind tunnel. The sway is unbearable and the fps goes down with each ""update"". Also bug that have been in the game forever such as the running man and loading a tow while seated in a vehicle have taken a backseat to all other ventures from OWI. If you don't have a mic buy one. I can't understand why they didn't make that a recommendation when buying the game. But it looks like OWI will continue to cater to the people who want to take vics from the spawn by themselves and drive to the nearest enemy squad instead of the vets that have propped the game up since project reality."
HELICOPTERS ARE SO FUCKING STUPID
"Its good, but performance is terrible, don't recommend"
"I joined, was a squad bot, and killed a griefer causing mass cass. and I got kicked for griefing. Thanks SOF, great server. My SL decided ""**** you too.""

Amazing Squad experience after not playing for a year, time to add one more."
"Not worth it, project reality is free and better"
unless your part of private group of people do not expect anyone to help or talk as far as that goes. slowest walking sim ive ever seen in 31 years sad to say it does not hold up to its name might as well play arma 3 or something else insurgency has more team work than any server on here i have 20 hrs in and lost any motivation to play anymore
"This game was very good, till they reworked the combat system and now its not as good and most of the game is spent walking back to position, added Micro transactions, and now a giant sphere in the sky? this is supposed to be a semi realistic milsim but now we have magic floating spheres that revive you when you're downed? what happened to the realism?

game that was genuinely enjoyable now a gutted mess :("
can't see teammates well also can't tell what to do in the game I was running for like 10 mins just to die and have no idea what happened
"Parkinson simulator
which probably fits the player base that are all 40 yr old wanna be operators. 
your trained solider runs out of energy in 7 steps 
you just simply cant aim 
the cope of the community is it realistic"
wdfawfawf
"combat update needs to be changed, its so unfun to play the game cause of it"
"Hide in bushes, be invisible, shoot a player, get lit up by 10 other enemies because somehow they have perfect hearing and vision?"
all the server admins have the strictest rules on server chat and also have a website that doxxes people who get banned on their server so they can ban you from every other server. It really is quite something. I can't believe SQUAD allows this. Cuckold behavior.
"Update: as of the lastest patch my game has started working properly agian which is wonderful, but i still fear it going bad agian with the next update so i changed my recommendation to a yes, but still keep the rest of my review in mind

Now im going to start off by saying that I absolutly LOVE this game. First off, the comunity is amazing, friendly, and most importantly always willing to help you. I have yet to find any toxicity within the player base. Even when games are going very bad, the team still friendly and just trying to have fun.

Secondly, the gameplay is something very unique that one cannot find almost anywhere else except from Arma and even better, it actually handles well and doesnt require a beast of a computer to run. This is the game for those out there who have played battlefield or other similar games but was dissapointed by the lack of tactical gameplay or realism. The maps in this are HUGE (well by most shoopters standards anyway. {Cough, cough, Arma, cough, cough}). Every player has to work with their squad (hence the name) or else they cant get anything done, and each person in a squad fills a specific and vital role.

Now my personal favorite part of the game is after the game has gone on for a bit and the defences have been built. (you can look it up there are some damn impressive fobs out there that have been made) These things feel like fortresses inside until it comes under attack then things get crazy. Explosions left and right, comms going nuts, medics running wild. Its awesome.

Now based off all of that one would think that this games deserves the biggest like anyone could ever give it. And once my next point gets fixed it will.

I CANT DAMN PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!

Sorry for the caps but Im really pissed about this. Whenever i launch the game, even though the settings clearly says its in 1920 - 1080, it seems to come up with a new random screen resolution and go with that.
""Well ok thats annoying, how about i just reset the settings. Hopefully that fixes it."" I say to myself. NOPE!!!! that just leaves it halfway off the screen. So I exit and look up a fix online. What I find is go into the files and change it. besides the fact that that alone is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it still doesnt work. As of right now the mouse if far too offset from the screen to even play AND the screen resolution is off.

Now I understand this is still in Alpha and glitches and problems should be expected, but I paid $40 for it so expect a review. Also I would be less pissed if the devs actually did anything to fix this problem instead of just adding new content to the game without any concern as to wether or not the game ACTUALLY IS PLAYABLE.

Sincerely the game is great and if it worked, it would probably be my favorite game on steam, but as of right now I cant even try to play it.

For those of you who didnt bother to actually read all of that.

Pros
- Awesome community
- Great maps
- Tactical gameplay
- Teamwork
- great classes and good gunplay
- BTRs
- New content all the time

Cons
-DOESNT ♥♥♥♥♥♥ WORK!!!!!!!
- Cant fix screen resolution or mouse offset problems
- Devs dont seem to try and fix before mentioned problems

Now please, dont think this is a bad game. Keep your eye on this game and see if these problems ever get fixed. Now hopefully the devs will see this and fix the problems with the next update so I can get back to the wondeful experience I once had.

"Ever since the Infantry Combat Overhaul, you can't align your sights worth of sh*t, you run out of stamina in 10 steps, and they add game breaking patches that don't make sense at all. If you have been interested in this game, don't get it. Invest in Arma or some other Milsim fps."
literally cannot play without crashing and steam won't refund so that's cool
"Always crashing, even after doing all the tricks in the book,as soon as you join, it crashes, then it works, you aim, boom crash again,needs to be fixed ASAP !!"
Bring back old Squad this shits Dog Water choppy as hell
"was a good game but the sway and stamina is all wrong, and the inability to aim straight 

modded servers are fun"
"I really want to like this game, mechanics and gun play are superb, there's a huge learning curve and i cant seem to find a server that is newbie friendly or understand WTF I am suppsoed to do when in game. get killed loads without seeing where from then lie down for 15mins waiting to be revived. I do keep coming back hoping something clicks with me"
game is full of homos
"This game is buns. Every 5 fucking seconds I get yelled at by a middle aged man that doesnt know where he belongs in society. You then proceed to have the drunk divorced dads that probably lost the kids, keep killing you because they don't know if your on their team or not."
"From being one of my favorite games to being added to the pile of once great games that are now ruined by the developers.
After ICO update the game is just unplayable and most importantly not fun anymore. Performance is terrible, constant obnoxious blurry vision, unrealistic sway, weird looking recoil that just makes no sense and so much more. Please just roll it back or add a seperate version of the game that doesn't have this stupid ICO update that no one asked for."
Parody of a tactical game.
"This game is a lag fest. Old smoothness is gone. 4070 , 5600x and runs like a-crack."
"walk for ten hours to your death while listening to a british person yell at you

3/10"
it was good until the update on ADS until they at least tone it down DONT BUY also servers becoming more liberal than the West when i play as the chinese faction its okay for people to say things like ching chong bong bong but as soon as i call someone a P**** thats to much also you cant swear at all on servers anymore youll get kicked immediately
"Went downhill after ICO update. Tried getting back into it, just didn't hit the same. Was a great game, but now feels like I've just wasted 4k hours on this POS. This game was a great option if you were looking for something in-between ARMA and BF/COD, but now it's trying too hard to be something that it's not. Such a shame."
"cant shoot, people dont understand the word squad itself and the mechanism is just to make it look like another milsim game but nothing close to it. nowonder 44 is also rekt"
"50 fps gaming with shitty shooting mechanic, suppresion mechanic sucks"
they should name this game Crash not squad it crashes every time i play it. seriously though wtf this is very annoying to say the least. none of my other steam games crash like this its hot trash do not buy.
"I have got to be honest, when this game works I love it. But for the love of God, I crash once every to every other game. I'm running a viciously stacked machine on new tech and this game can't run for more than about 30 minutes in a server before it bites the bullet. I constantly check my software and hardware and its  every single time I play type of problem. I don't get it and I'm about f***ing over it.

Just to be clear, this doesn't happen on any other game."
"Not worth the price at all. Server browser is broken, most of the english speaking servers for EU speak primarily other language and you can't filter them out."
ICO update is trash
Unplayable game the game was fun but now it sucks no one knows how to play and almost all servers have admins that don't do anything no one plays logistics and every one plays like its call of duty absolutely unplayable today
A game that features armor that plays a large role in a teams victory but cannot properly design the game to have tracked vehicles be able to go over tiny rocks. This game is not worth $50
can't do shit
"Each update somehow makes the game worse. The ICO ruined playing inf for me but i soldiered on thinking it would get better. The new maps were bad for armour and i soldiered on. The new layers system has stopped any form of armour balance occurring and im struggling to want to continue. The games core is pretty good, but the level of incompetence shown in each and every update sucks the soul outta me. Im still gonna play it, im too deep in the hole.

At least the star wars mod has given it a bit more life for me."
Crashes 10 min into any match
"Like playing a fatty with asthma. You will spend your life running, getting your breath back and have an aim of a spastic. Recoil will send your teeth down your throat. Dogshit

Previous review:
""Uninstalled. Updates = Dogshit"""
"Game has a steep learning curve, it has a lot of rules and easy to get kicked from a game or your own squad. Its buggy as hell, There are some games i cant even play because lag is getting me killed. i see lots of people disconnecting each game and its not just them quitting. There is an obvious problem with hackers, but every FPS game has this issue. This game has fairly long queue times, but not as bad as Beyond The Wire. It is without a doubt the most realistic game i have ever played, but when you spend 30 minutes running in a direction then die it is sort of a waste of time. The vehicles are hard AF to drive so its like your vehicle is always drifting instead of going straight."
drop fps in nivdia  1070 8g ti  wtfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff

"9/10 times your whole time is completely retarded but when people actually lock in its fun, however this never happens anymore so"
I have a 4080 super and the graphics maxed out yet the game looks like 2013 rust also GET RID OF MOTION BLUR FROM BULLETS
it would be fun if it did not crash everytime i play the game
"The good: 
- Excellent community.
- Good balance between realism and enjoy-ability.
- Good vehicle game play.
- No grind or pay to win!
- Very little hacking.

The Bad: 
- Team balance is sometimes an issue, especially on servers run by clans. 
- Some maps and game modes are not much fun.

The Ugly: 
- Recent updates totally ruined infantry game play. Shooting is nearly impossible. Never in my life IRL have I had so much trouble aligning sights. This is the sole reason I quit playing this game in recent months, and the only reason I don't recommend it at this time."
"In some ways it's great. It does manage to capture the great gameplay and sense of combat from project reality.

However, the gunplay and movement mechanics are so awful that almost every fight is testing your patience for frustration. You can literally take your hands off the mouse and have a drink while your character tries to aim at the enemy.
Any fights within 10m are completely pointless.

Additionally, the technical side is not good. The graphics feel very unpolished and ""unity game"" like, while at the same time having high PC spec requirements, low fps and input lag. There are other games that run 3x faster and look 3 x better.
For example Project Reality.

Project Reality was a hacked together mod for the BF2 engine. So many of the functions and gamerules in that game were based on server scripting, using chat commands and understanding the non-obvious rulesets because they could not change the UI etc.

This should not be the case when making a game from scratch, yet the dev team just ported over many of the gameplay mechanics, instead of making the new UI/gameplay more userfriendly."
sux but i love it
Might be a good game.  I could not get past the horrible graphics.
Horrible performance with oudated graphics (except explosions)
MEH
epic broke my game
"If you like waiting for a spot in a server for 30 minutes, this is the game for you."
boring
"The fact you can get community banned from every server just because of one bad admin is ridiculous. For those who don't understand what i'm referring to, i'm referring to the squad community ban list. Most NA servers use this community tool which enables a reputation tracker on your account that carries across all servers. I got a permanent ban on Potato Fields for destroying friendly assets and my ""Risk Rating"" went from 0/10 to 10/10 on my account and i'm no longer able to play on any of the consistently populated and decent ping servers. Also, most of the NA servers are modded by libshit rtards that flip their lid over the most minorly offensive things."
"graphics are dated and it plays extremely weird. i saw their updates and it's so much worse.
honestly, with this investor behind it that also ruined my formerly favourite shooter franchise, it's no surprise i can't say anything positive about this game."
game is shit now
"Gunplay in this game went from perfect to unplayable. CQC fights are a joke, and they still haven't tweaked this game after ICO patch."
good simulator of an obese 50 year old man that needs to shake his hands so hard that he barely holds the rifle
"If you want a combined arms, tactical game that require teamwork that you can jump straight into, then buying Squad will probably be worth it to you. I can't however recommend a game that is so similar to Battlefield 2, a game almost 2 decades old. Squad still is very similar to Battlefield 2 in that it is still very much a free-for-all-sandbox type game. For example, let's say you want a run a vehicle Squad, filling some tactical niche. The moment you lose the vehicle, you are no longer able to do that, due to respawn timers which can be over 10 minutes. Further, a crippled vehicle will block the spawn of a new one. Now suddenly you have become a different type of Squad, and whatever plan or tactical approach you had goes out of the window. Neither is there a robust system for claiming vehicles or ensuring the people operating these vehicles actually cooperate with the team. This is indicative of an overall design that prevent players from applying any kind of consistent tactical approach, or deliberate teamwork. As a result the experience of meaningful teamwork and tactics are rare, unless one joins a more rigid competitive scene.

One of the greatest memes in the game is how Squad leaders carry the success and intent of the game. Especially infantry squad leaders who has to cajole 8 complete stranger into doing something. The free-for-all nature of the game does not alleviate Squad leader insanity which is sure to follow. As a result, you will have 3-4 main infantry Squads, and if they are even remotely close to one of two relevant objectives you are are having a relatively great match. The points about vehicle Squads apply here, even more so. The sad fact about Squad is that teamwork is optional."
Game used to be good but since they changed the combat style and aim style its unplayable for me you cant aim/run without your gun swaying all over the place and the recoil is just so unrealistic and takes me out of the game. In a game where running is such a big part your guy gets tired after 10 seconds of sprinting. Also they have a suppression feature that turns your screen completely blurry for way too long that will just completely take you out of the fight not sure how people still enjoy this game and put up with the pointless updates at its current state but hey maybe its for you just giving my opinion and heads up
game crashes too much and i mean way too much my drivers are updated and my pc is on the higher end and it always seems to crash when either loading in and mid game at first i thought it was an issue only i was dealing with but i slowly figured out that this issue hasnt only happened with me but wit a large group of players. i mean if they could figure it out id play but i literally cant play lmaooo
can not refresh server anymore. Got totally blocked. And this game is more like a walking or driving simulator as it is not that fun(hard core).
Play this game if your a pu$$y and kick people for being new @Playground Server
This game isn't fun
Trying to play after the ICO update is like visiting a best friends grave. I'll revisit it once a year and leave in tears.
"Waaaaay too much. I mean, at least let people choose their loadout to an extent instead of forcing use of those awful optics. In the training I get no optic which is OK but those awful optics being forced. No thanks. HLL is 100x the game this mil sim wannabe will ever be. It's a shame too, I was VERY excited to try it since it reminded me of the slow paced realistic Americas Army 20 years ago... Nope. Big flop. HLL is the best game of this variety out and will continue to stay that way. Squad is HLL with slight variations that make it much worse to play. Otherwise it's overall the same game, with slightly different graphics."
hope you enjoy sand maps with nothing on them cause that's all these people play. its like insurgency but somehow bigger with less stuff. only play on a free weekend.
trash game full of Crash and the Garbage Unreal Launcher and getting kill from no were
"I have a very good pc and internet but the game keeps crashing to desktop or crashing on loading map?  And i paid for this game, WOW!"
"shit game, you need to play on low with 4k resolution just to see enemies. no max render distance. running sim, buy another game."
"Voting system fucked things even worse than the combat update. Good idea on paper, shit in the field"
"just watch other people play this, its not worth the headache or disc space.
""with some more hours into the game i can now say that, if you want to bullied by any narcissistic asshole who is a squad leader into doing their every whim and will or else youll be kicked from the squad meaning you will only be able to use the recruit kit then this might be the game for you. fuck man i just want to play a fucking game!-"
"Not working great on the deck
When finishing a game the next server is causing the deck to stuck/crush and it's ruining the experience"
the game devs are on weed they like to take money but they dont fix the server browser or the sound output bug
Very Shit game
"Loved the first 230 hours, but the ICO is complete garbage. Gunplay is ruined, every server is nothing but armor squads because no one wants to hold a rifle."
arma without the realism
"i can't find any server + the optimize is so bad , but it's nice game"
дерьмо ебаное
Can the someone just give us an option to revert to before ICO with servers too?
"REVISED: Original Below
I am publicly revising my review after an extra 120+ ICO hours. They have walked back several of the most egregious elements of the ICO combat, however, the overall shift in infantry combat has done nothing to ""slow down"" game play nor make it more methodical. It encourages a poor style of ""camping"" (due to still incredibly bad stamina), excessive vehicle dominance, and a lack of veteran players leading and playing. None of these were issues pre-ICO and they objectively make the game worse while frustrating people who knew Squad for it's premium shooting mechanics. 

Where to go from here? The develops are clearly not going to completely rollback ICO, the damage has been done and the community has lost significant amounts of experienced players due to how aggressively the overhaul was deployed. That is okay, numbers are at a consistent high, I hope they are able to gradually reduce the worst of the ICO (absurd suppression and noodle arms) while keeping its core implemented. As it currently stands, I still cannot recommend this game for a new player seeking a tactic SHOOTER, that prioritizes combat over a false sense of milsim. 
______________________________________________________________________
1200 hours since the very start of Squad, read the other recent reviews from high-hour players. I've watched many experienced friends turn away from the game and provide negative reviews.

The recent infantry overhaul is brutal and absolutely kills the game for players who had played it previously. Maybe it's fine for new players who were not familiar with the mechanics. Squad used to have the best mix of infantry combat and tactical game play, now the combat is one of the absolute worst on the market. Your character is incredibly slow, clunky, and low-stamina and weapons have increased sway and are inaccurate. This was all to slow game play but effectively makes the game more frustrating than Arma without the fun gun play.

I don't understand who these changes are implemented for but it driving your veteran players away from the game. I do not recommend buying this game unless you are keen on waiting for 30 minute vehicle spawns as that's the only way its playable now."
They completely ruined this game. Performance wise and gameplay wise. Infantry combat overhaul is the worst update in the history of the game. Your soldier is a fat stay at home dad that couldn't complete basic training and is carrying military equipment and a machine gun he can't aim to save his life. And can only run 10 feet before he's out of breath. This game is 70%-90% running btw. Let that sink in how miserable that is.
New infantry update ruined squad... Fix your gun play please
Cant join a server without a thousand random rules
"Games dogshit, OWI can't stop themselves from changing shit that worked perfectly fine. As of right now I can't 2 tap someone to the neck under 10 m with 7.62x54r lmfao."
Don't like it
"The first thing I have to say is the reality of the shooting, I really like the sound, it's incredible and contributes to the atmosphere of the war, a big minus in the game is not recognizing the uniforms, they are all the same, so someone from your team will always kill you, get used to it, the graphics are not bad, but they are very poor, which spoils the game is a lot when you enter the buildings, there is nothing, I don't think it's worth this money, if you like it, go for it"
"One of the worst optimization in a game I've ever seen, i3 10th 16GB RTX 3060 only get up to 40fps."
Vehicles are the only playable thing in this game. ICO update killed the fun in infantry.
Long wait times to join a server due to queuing system.
م
"Game looks nice, 90% of player base is just random high ping screamers lol 
5/10 for quality, game play is ass"
Disappointing game.. This game is more like a walking simulator than a battlefield like
"ICO killed the game. This is my fourth(?) account because I sometimes get toxic and get banned from servers that I like, so I've supported the game for years and recommended it to all of my friends that are into milsim and milsim adjacent games, but it's not worth it anymore. I've played since 2017, I've given ~5000 hours of my life to this game, but I don't think I'll ever play it again other than cursory glances to see if it's been fixed.

The main issue currently is not what I expected from the ICO, during the playtests and when it was first introduced I thought it was completely ok, and mechanically it's fine. It slowed down infantry combat a little bit but not significantly, what actually changed was the community - the complete destruction of team cohesion and competency. Maybe there's some server where it's better or some community that can still play well enough, and this was somewhat of an issue before, but I haven't had a game in the last 40 hours of gameplay where my SL both had a mic and understood that you could in fact look at a map and make decisions about where you should be, and when I SL, I can do ok but everything feels almost random. All your friendly squads will be scattered across the map with no rhyme or reason, the armor will either ram into enemy fobs and die or completely annihilate the enemy, you'll take points with literally no resistance up until you get to the one point where they have a fob and then you're facing the entire enemy team, and no one will respond on the command channel. 

I don't know why the ICO destroyed the community, the base level mechanical changes don't seem to imply that it would have, but it did. I don't think rolling it back would fix it, maybe it has to do with server browser issues, maybe it's been introduced to more new players who enjoy the game in a way that I don't. If you get the game and end up loving it that's fine by me, but as it stands now it's a husk of what it was before.

TL;DR - ICO killed gaem, mechanics OK, community dead."
Gameplay is terrible. rooms are full of people who quit instantly no controller headphone compatibility. total waste of money
"This game was good when the shooting felt reactive to a players actual ability. Now it's less of a shooter than most fps games on Roblox. Feels more like a roleplaying game now. Fun game got flushed down the drain, oh well plenty of other shooters to enjoy."
game keeps crashing the minute i load into a game
Absolutely do not buy this game under any circumstances. Mobile game CEO making the best decisions of his life out here.
"They took one of, if not the, best immersive 2000s era shooter and actively updated it into being a game I won't even boot up anymore after 400 hours... 

ICO took everything that made this a great shooter and turned it into a walking simulator with loud noises. The game is no longer about getting into intense and fun gun fights. It's really a shame. I gave the ICO a fair shot and kept loading up the game for a while, telling myself I just needed to get used to the changes. It's not going to happen, they ruined the fun.

edit: I saw some other commentors suggesting allowing individual servers to determine if the gameplay is pre or post ICO. This would bring back your veteran players who want intense team and skill based firefights while allowing new unskilled players to enjoy their team deathmatch walking simulator."
"DEVS HAVE CHANGED THE GAME SO MUCH THAT ITS NOT EVEN THE SAME GAME IT WAS MANY YEARS AGO, EVERYTHING WE'VE WANTED THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING ELSE THAT DOESN'T MATTER. GAMEPLAY IS LIKE HAVING A DRUNK 8 YEAR OLD KID HOLDING A RIFLE."
old squad best squad
.
Worst milsim of them all move round like a segway going 2mph. Gun moves about the screen like a fidget spinner. Gunplay is awful everytime I come back to the game to give it another go i'm reminded instantly whats so wrong with the game and there's alot. Do yourself a favour and go play Arma 3 or Hell Let Loose this game blows and you can have 10000x more fun on either one of them games compared to this cesspit of degenerate keyboard generals.
Not fun
infantry update is not good. gunplay is terrible. for turtle players and mech/armor players.
"Update to ""improve"" infantry movement and combat was a huge miss. Makes the game nearly impossible to play in most circumstances when anyone is shooting even remotely in your direction. Go back to the old game play and hope maybe some people will rejoin the game otherwise this is another example of game developers messing with something they shouldnt have and killing a once very good game. Also, take out that dumb map and team voting."
"games unplayable. cant finish more than 30 minutes continual w/o game crashing. my pc specs are more than enough. 3080ti with 32 g ram. done everything under the sun to fix the crashing issue. game uninstalled, 0/10 do not recommend."
"4090, 24 gb gddr6. and 64 gb of ddr5 and a i9-13900k at medium settings 60 fps max my friends temu pc runs squad better"
"This used to be a good game

I used to really like squad, having over 1000 hours but over the last year it has gotten pretty bad. Although I liked some of the Combat Overhaul play-test the actual implementation now is terrible and gets frustrating very quickly, combine this with a lack of good SL's just leads to complete sh!t shows for most games. 

This is not helped by what looks like developer incompetence regarding the server hosting, which would just show random servers stopping you from joining your friends.

Overall the game currently March 2024 is in a pretty poor state and was significantly better 2 or so years ago but has gone majorly down hill over the last year or so.

I realise people will say the player base has increased which means the game is good but I would say most of these players are on the Chinese servers, which there is a lot of now."
Gunplay feels horrible compared to how it used to be.
"The game was good despite some bugs and some efficiency issues regarding the rendering of the weapon sights that have been corrected with future updates (at least for me), but with the v6 update with the combat overhaul the game does not feel the same, it is an update to gun play that no one has asked for and I hope they revert it (but I doubt it), it is a game that before that patch I would recommend but currently and unfortunately NO"
"Rather be trapped in a swimming pool full of piranhas than play this, and I'm serious."
Reverse the ICO or watch your game die.
"cant even find servers on the game, HOW CAN I NOT FIND, HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO ME. Therefore bad game, ALSO THIS GAME HAS SO BAD UNREALISTIC OPTICS FOR THE GUNS, SOOO BAD LIKE MAKES NO SENSE WHY YOU CANT HAVE A NORMAL OPTIC, CANT sometime you lucky and find good optic but is rare 99% of them are terrible soo bad you it ruins the game. LET ME JUST HAVE A NORMAL RED DOT SIGHT OR SUM. not cool"
GAME IS RAN BY LIBERALS WHO BAN FREE SPEECH THE ADMINS ON MAN SEVERS ARE FAGGOTS AND NOBODY LIKE A FAGGOT
Honestly... its hot GARBAGE. Janky af. Sloppy. Take notes from Hell Let Loose and get good. I'll wait for Squad2 made by a different studio
Only good with mods and friends
"I use to recommend this game to my friends because how how fun and organized the gameplay was. However, ever since the ICO update, the enjoyment was gone. Devs really wanted the game to be more realistic only to fail and making it unrealistic. ADS is so bad and the weapon sway feels like your character is drunk. Whether you're prone, crouched or standing, it's unbearable and have to wait until all your stamina is back up to actually land A shot. 
Went from playing everyday to only play modded servers like Galactic Contention once every other month, or just not play at all."
"I love realistic shooters, I've played hundreds of them, but I've never seen a game with an Aim Down Sights (ADS) system as bad as the one this game has, it doesn't matter if you're lying down, and with a bipod, as soon as you aim the sights move as if you were in an earthquake for several seconds, it is literally unplayable, gun fights depend on who was lucky to hit the first shot.

And no, before you say it, I'm not saying that ADS has to be like Call Of Duty where you quickscope the entire lobby, but the one this game has is totally excessive, it completely ruins your experience, the sad thing is It wasn't like that before, it was because of an update they did where they changed everything. 

Compare it to all other squad competitors and NONE have an ADS system as bad as this game has, freaking disgusting."
"Squad: A Once-Promising Strategy Shooter Now Lost to Commercial Greed

Once hailed as a beacon of tactical excellence, Squad has plummeted from grace into the depths of commercialized mediocrity. The game's descent began with the ominous shift in its development studio from American to Chinese hands, marking the beginning of its tragic transformation into a soulless cash grab.

Gone are the days of genuine strategic game-play and immersive experiences. In their place, we are bombarded with a nauseating array of in-game purchases, skins, and emotes, all designed to empty players' wallets rather than enrich their gaming experience. What was once a community-driven game now feels like a shameless money-making scheme, orchestrated by faceless corporate overlords who care little for the game's original vision or its dedicated player base.

The essence of Squad has been diluted, its soul stripped away in favor of profit margins and shareholder satisfaction. Players are no longer soldiers fighting for a cause; they are mere consumers, endlessly enticed to spend more money on virtual trinkets that add nothing of substance to the gameplay.

The transition from American to Chinese ownership has only exacerbated the game's decline, as cultural nuances and player expectations have been disregarded in favor of profit-driven decisions. What remains is a hollow shell of what Squad once was—a cautionary tale of corporate greed run amok.

In conclusion, the current iteration of Squad is a bitter disappointment, a betrayal of the trust and loyalty of its once-devoted fan base. Unless drastic changes are made to steer the game back on course, it is destined to fade into obscurity, remembered only as a cautionary tale of what happens when greed triumphs over passion and integrity.

YOU KILLED SQUAD"
i love this game it is so good :)
was better before all the effects and mortar....
"Graphically and map wise its really nice. Its just not fun, its not engaging and its not friendly to newbies. The update has rebound all my keys. Yes its a steep learning curve, I just don't think its worth it."
takes for ever to load
"No, just so Dantes doesnät buy it.. Otherwise yez."
"Don't get me wrong, this game is really cool, but you'll need to spend a lot of time to understand the game, basically everybody that plays is a professional sergeant for some reason.

If you want a game to get a quick kill every minute or so, this game isn't for you"

Server admins need to figure out how to make map and faction voting work but would be better if they never added it.
"it used to be fun before the infantry combat overhaul

update: there are mods that make the game fun again. one of them is Global Escalation."
Battlefield but boring and poorly optimized.
please pleeeeease turn off voip during voting phase. Love this game and didn't leave a review before but I am now in the hope this gets seen by devs. It's so irritating listening to the arguments.
you turned my 40gb game to an 80gb game with emotes
Very bad optimization which makes it just not fun overall
"DEV Scam Pattern:

1. Hype up mil sim
2. Release Buggy Mess
3. Add Broken Content
4. Decrease Framerate
5. Vanish for 6-12 months
6. Repeat

Check out the player count of starship troopers extermination too..."
"I think the First Person Shooter aspect of this game is now absolute garbage and the only way to enjoy my time on this game is playing the Star Wars Galactic Contention mod. Combat in first person only vanilla (mostly) feels extremely sluggish and pretty much just promotes me to instantly grab a specialist kit so I can sit in a bush and pray that I don't get shot from some random undisclosed location. Sure, the rest of the game is great, and I think that the way that you can command and go about it with a strategy is fairly nice. As well as a compliment on the Armor system and how it interacts with other classes within the game. However, as I stated the PVP is sluggish and promotes nothing but sitting down for 10 minutes and praying that I don't get killed from another guy with a 10x scope that can see everything if he just climbs on a rock and also prays that nobody can see him. Even if I do get a setup I'll probably be dead anyway to any other aspect in the game like armor and whatnot. Yes, I think I'm aggressive with my playstyle, however the way that Defense and Attack is promoted in this game only rewards prone players with ranged weapons. I feel like any time I try to ""play for the team/objective"" I'm kinda just throwing my body at a location after enough Armor support or artillery to hopefully capture it. Nobody is playing this game like Ready or Not, Six days in Fallujah, and whatever other games they're trying to model the infantry system around. A huge majority of players are casual, and I honestly don't think I've ever seen anyone in this game play the game with actual strategies from an Infantry perspective. Absolute Garbage, but sometimes fun - Especially on the Star Wars servers which for some reason are mostly dead. 5/10

(edit)

As of writing this it is 3/26 '24 
I am currently waiting for the Galactic Contention mod to come back online due to the update breaking the game yet again. I am very bored. So I decided to read through some reviews of this game and noticed that in my review from whenever the hell I did review this game, I left out a key point, this being that In my time in the game I never didn't experience teamwork regardless of the ICO update being out. Any positive review in favor/support of the ICO update just advocates for more teamwork being promoted. I personally don't see it. ICO pretty much just punishes any casual or even experienced player in dealing with harder PVP, meaning that if you don't have a red dot and a frag grenade, you won't win CQB engagements, because all of infantry is now a ranged fight, with anyone focusing on Close quarters being extremely punished which makes no sense in regards to the HUGE CQB maps, which is pretty much every single Middle Eastern map, and more. I find that many reviews in favor of ICO often state and understand that the game was being moved in a faster pace, an ideal that Offworld didn't yet understand how they wanted to implement. Previous gameplay was much more favorable to casual and even regular players and that's why the game got extremely popular, which is a common trend now, where people get extremely hyped for a random game everyone plays it for a month and then it dies from media because nobody plays it as much as they did. I know that this game has it's own audience and did not die, and that the media portion pretty much randomly happens to games and then doesn't entirely effect it if it has its own actual playerbase. However, what I'd like to mention is that Offworld made ICO to Slow down gameplay because it was ""too fast paced"" which is understandable that they want it to go in a different direction, but they could've done it in a different or better way. The whole ""Teamwork and synergy"" topic isn't really that huge. I personally think there's plenty of counters to people that want to ""lone wolf"" and that's pretty obvious because it was already in the game. You can literally kick people from your squad, hell on most servers you can kick them for any reason you want! And regardless old PVP and New PVP, if it's just one dude odds are he won't win any fight against a large group if he doesn't have a Sniper and at least a couple hundred meters away from the people this person decides to engage.
When I first played before ICO and during the beginning of it, I noticed that the Social aspect was a lot more alive, and that's mostly because people played the game because it was enjoyable. Now, even if I yap the whole session and talk to multiple squads, I find it hard to find people that are willing to engage in a large social aspect. ICO literally destroyed the game and it's popularity mainly because it now drives away players unless they A. Lie to themselves while playing regular Infantry B. Play Armor/Leader roles C. Play the game with friends or run modded. Sure, I can play a couple vanilla infantry rounds, squaddy or not, I can't help but feel like something's missing, or at least the game could be more fun. 
If you decide to buy this game I highly recommend that you consider Galactic Contention as your primary source of gameplay. You should play Vanilla and modded Squad if you so wish, and I recommend that just so you can gain an opinion on the game's overall state, and what the shell of the game is like. I am an extreme advocate for Galactic Contention because this game modded is quite literally the Star Wars game we never got, and is probably the best mod on any game I've played to exist, simply because it's pretty much a whole different game. Cheers.

Yet again, on April 3rd '24 I will yet again state something about the game. I find that combat makes sense to have CQB loadouts and Long range weaponry/loadouts. However that isn't really an option and you can't exactly pick/customize how you want your weapon to be. I do think that it makes sense to pick the right kit, but the way that the game works doesn't exactly make sense for that because of constant movement because of POIs constantly being updated on the map. I think that combat still works, but is extremely sluggish and punishing on vanilla. Galactic Contention has absolutely perfected and fixed that problem except for some ranged scopes on weapons, which do have crazy weapon sway. This game is good, but some major changes are flawed and can be balanced. It is only a matter of listening to the playerbase, and getting an idea on how they want to shift the game."
"My soldiers arms are made of ramen noodles and the only gun hes ever held must of been a nerf gun because the mf cannot run for more than 20 steps without blowing chunks out of pure exhaustion, let alone aim the weapon without shaking like a disabled ice spice trying to throw ass with his battle rifle"
"I shouldn't need to explain why doubling down on making a slow game slower consistently, in addition to further enhancing the extreme advantage you already had in this game while defending is a bad idea.

Its not even slower in a ""fun"" realistic way - it just feels like dogshit to take 20+ minutes to walk somewhere to die because your noodle ass arms can't aim at a guy 20 feet away - or getting suppressed by rounds hitting a wall 2+ walls away from you - it just doubles down on literally every bad feature in any recent FPS game to make what was once enjoyable now like playing the worst parts of metro in bf3.

TLDR - Inertia is dogshit in tarkov, and OWI is stupid enough to not learn from the ""other"" ""realistic"" game to not fuck with movement - go play project reality instead - its better and free."
MEA Faction is SUCK VERY VERY SUCK
"doodoo booboo stink ass game, doodoo map voting, everyone stupid and TURKISH"
"This game was one of my favorites when it first released, but the past few years now, any time an update comes out (very often), I have to redownload the ENTIRE game. 60mb update? Prepare for a 100+ gb download then. Absolute worst experience when trying to play with friends and I have to tell them I can join in 2 hours. This is also the only game where my download speed drops to single digits constantly. Most other downloads I average 45-60mbps."
I wonder how many players you lose because you wait in a 15 minute que to enter the game and then it crashes. Im running the game on a top of the line gaming pc... no other game has the same amount of issues as this one does. Open OFFICIAL SERVERS... stop being cheap!
i hate this community
no
"cant join friends, cant see friends, 60% walking, 30% waiting to spawn fuck this game"
"sadly they ruined this game. it still has the best community ever, but after several attempts to play after the suppression ""update"" it has never been the same. if they could have implemented a system that achieved a more difficult system while keeping the fun things would have been great."
"You probably saw a youtuber playing this game and thought it could be fun. Well...no. Unless you're a part of some clan or whatever. If you're not and want to play with some randoms, there's about 1 in 10 chance that your match will fun. The remaining 9 will be filled with randoms forcing you to play squad leader because nobody ever wants to do it. You like being a squad lead all the time, trying to force a group of Arabic speaking people to listen to you? If so, then you're gonna have fun. Otherwise...no, it's not as funny as CCs make it out to be"
FIX YOUR SERVER BUGGED SERVER LOBBY FFS
Decided to finally start playing this game again after around 6 months of not touching it which is around when the new “update” came out and god I can’t stand it now. The gun play is just absolutely awful now. I understand they were going for realism balance but this is far from it. I have a lot of experience shooting firearms in real life from long range to 3 gun competitions and all I can say is I think a 5 year old could control a rifle better than my character can now. Your sight goes black for like 2 seconds when you ads. Your gun sways way more than it should. Don’t even try to rapid fire with a magnified optic. I just feel like gun fights now within 100m are just completely random on who wins because you can’t shoot quick at all without your sight going black and your gun rising to the moon. It’s just absurd. I genuinely feel like my character has cerebral palsy. I pray they change this because the old squad was a great game now it’s just a fraction of what it used to be.
Shooty shoot… realistic tho
"Game is a shell of what it once was. Even after all these years, they're still figuring out core mechanics of the game with endless changes to gunplay. I reinstalled the game after 18 months to an absolute shit show. I used to think pub squad was bad - now it's so horrible. The sheer number of blueberries that have absolutely no idea what's going on in the game is astounding. The game used to centre around a 'squad', that worked together with other 'squads' to achieve a team goal. Now all you have is mindless no-micers with spagetti arms running for 20km because no one can figure out how to place a fob/hab, and when they do, they put it on an irrelevant objective, 3 points behind the active cap.

Don't buy this absolute garbage game."
was fun for the first few days i played but it got boring super quick and just tried picking up the game again and kept getting kicked from squads one several servers when i had just joined them and didnt even get a chance to spawn in
"the one that say it took forever to aim and the solder having no stamina were right. this game mask very unrealistic game mechanic with ""realistic"". like imagine training 2 year, just for you run 20 meter and cant aim a gun that you train with for 2 year, it just took too long for steady aim. the server too...damn they really depend on the community dont they? not even 1 official server on SEA."
"this game is terrible, don't recommend"
"After the ICO ""update"" in 2023 aiming and running feels like they put a 400 pound fat kid in a kit and told him to try his best in the field. The sway is unmanageable, the rear site sways and takes 3 seconds to zero in with the front site, and you can only run 15 meters before needing to sit down and take a break for 20 seconds. And these maps are huge.

Just play Hell let loose or arma at this point."
it way to weird and team killing is super bad cuz if the dev idea ti make each units uniform the same and the aiming is so bad not a recommended game for people haveing fun
too expensive
fuck off
After the new Infantry Overhaul update this game has gone to a dumpster fire. This is what happens when you sell out to a chinese company for the profit instead of keeping up with your promises. Snakes in the Grass
